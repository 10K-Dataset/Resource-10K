PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

We are a leading provider of scientific
instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical,
biomedical, environmental testing and general industrial
markets. We design, manufacture, market and service products and
systems within three business units:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

We are a leading provider of drug
    discovery, genetic screening, environmental and chemical
    analysis tools and instrumentation.

•

Optoelectronics.

We
    provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty
    lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products
    and other specialty end markets.

•

Fluid Sciences.

We
    provide critical fluid control and containment systems for
    highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and
    semiconductor fabrication facilities.

In 2002, we had $1,505.0 million in sales
from continuing operations.

We are a Massachusetts corporation, founded in
1947. Our headquarters are in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and we
market our products and systems in more than 125 countries. As
of December 29, 2002, we had approximately 10,700
employees. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, and we are a component of the S&P 500 Index.

We maintain a website with the address
www.perkinelmer.com. We are not including the information
contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by
reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K. We make
available free of charge through our website our annual reports
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these
reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish
them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we
intend to disclose on our website any amendments to, or waivers
from, our code of ethics that are required to be publicly
disclosed pursuant to rules of the SEC.

Recent Developments

As part of our efforts to refocus our Company on
our core businesses, we have recently taken the following
measures.

Life and Analytical
Sciences.

In October 2002, we formed
our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit by combining our
Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses.

Security and Detection Systems
Business.

In June 2002, we completed
the sale of our Security and Detection Systems business to L-3
Communications. We received cash proceeds in this transaction of
approximately $100.0 million. These proceeds are subject to
a working capital adjustment, which we do not expect to be
material. We have reflected this business as a discontinued
operation for all periods presented in this annual report on
Form 10-K.

Telecommunications Component and Entertainment
Lighting Businesses.

In June 2002, our
Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our
Telecommunications Component business, and a plan to sell our
Entertainment Lighting business, as part of our continued
efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We have
reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all
periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Packard BioScience.

In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard
BioScience Company for consideration of approximately
$764.0 million, primarily in the form of approximately
22 million shares of our common stock and our assumption of
$118.2 million in debt. The acquisition extended our
capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample
preparation, and strengthened our position as a global provider
of comprehensive drug discovery solutions.



Fluid Sciences.

In
October 2001, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our
Fluid Sciences business unit, at which time we reflected the
business as a discontinued operation in our consolidated
financial statements in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of
Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” Due to
external market conditions, we did not complete the sale of this
business within the one-year time period afforded by APB
No. 30. Our consolidated results from continuing operations
therefore again reflect our Fluid Sciences business unit for all
periods presented in this report.

NEN Life Sciences.

In July 2000, we completed our acquisition of NEN Life Sciences,
Inc., a provider of state-of-the-art drug discovery products,
services, reagents and technologies to the life sciences
industry. We purchased NEN Life Sciences for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $418.0 million. In
connection with the acquisition, we paid approximately
$350.0 million in cash and issued warrants to purchase
approximately 600,000 shares of our common stock. In addition,
we repaid approximately $50.0 million of outstanding
indebtedness of NEN Life Sciences.

Life and Analytical Sciences

We are a leading provider of drug discovery,
genetic screening and chemical analysis tools and
instrumentation. Our instruments are used in daily applications
for scientific research and clinical applications. Our research
products provide the fundamental tools necessary for a variety
of testing applications that are critical to the development of
many of our customers’ product pipelines.

We formed our Life and Analytical Sciences
business unit in October 2002 by combining our Life Sciences and
Analytical Instruments businesses. For the year ended
December 29, 2002, the Life Sciences and Analytical
Instruments reporting segments together generated sales of
$991.7 million.

We combined our Life Sciences and Analytical
Instruments businesses to improve our operational scale, which
we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and to
more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’
sales, service and research and development organizations. We
expect that this new integrated business will allow us to
provide a single point of contact to our customers and to
promote our sales efforts to senior levels of their
organizations. We believe that these senior decision makers are
positioned to expand the range of products and services their
organizations purchase from us. We are targeting annualized cost
savings from the combination of these businesses of between
$30.0 million and $45.0 million. The combination of
our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses will
require changes to our organizational structure, processes and
systems over the next year. Because we anticipate that the
benefits of the combination of these businesses will not be
fully realized until 2004, we are targeting cost savings of
between $12.0 million and $25.0 million in 2003. We cannot
assure you that we will achieve any of these cost savings.

Life Sciences

Our Life Sciences reporting segment within this
business unit helps our customers solve complex analytical
problems encountered in drug discovery and genetic screening
laboratories. For drug discovery, we offer a wide range of
instrumentation, software and consumables, including reagents,

radioactive labeling and the detection of nucleic acids and
proteins. For genetic screening laboratories, we provide
software, reagents and analysis tools to test for various
inherited disorders. These clinical screening programs help
diagnose and prevent disease by identifying those most at risk.
We sell our genetic screening solutions to public health
authorities and private health care organizations around the
world. For the 12 months ended December 29, 2002, our

In the aerospace market, we are a leading
provider of sealing and pneumatic systems for large commercial
transport aircraft, business and regional jets. Most major
aircraft and turbine engine manufacturers use our products to
reduce leakage and improve reliability. For example, we design
and produce high-pressure accumulators used to moderate pressure
in hydraulic systems. New fleet orders and maintenance on
existing aircraft generally create demand for our aerospace
products and services.

In the semiconductor equipment market, we provide
components and sub-assembly integration and processing services

various brand names, including Belfab®,
Callisto

TM

, Centurion

TM

and
PressureScience

TM

.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and
services through their own specialized sales forces as well as
independent foreign and domestic manufacturer’s
representatives, distributors and agents. Our businesses
sometimes enter into joint venture and license agreements with
local firms in foreign countries to manufacture and market their
products. As of December 29, 2002, we had approximately
2,500 sales and service representatives operating in
approximately 45 countries and marketing products in
approximately 125 countries.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Each of our reporting segments use raw materials
and supplies that are generally readily available in adequate
quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We typically do
not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. In some
cases, we may rely on a single supplier for particular items,
although we believe that we could obtain these items from
alternative suppliers, if necessary.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents
and have patent applications pending in the United States and
abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from
third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable
in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio,
we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and
know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign
trademarks, registered trademarks and trade names for a variety
of our product names, and have applications for the registration
of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and
abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are
important to the development of each of our reporting segments,
but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing
technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop
and maintain the competitive position of each of our reporting
segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or
other proprietary right would have a materially adverse effect
on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation
or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of
infringement, to enforce our or our licensors’ patents, to
protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual
property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or
third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of
this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion
of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or
proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or
expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual
property or cease the sale of a commercial product or require us
to license the disputed property from third parties. We are
currently one of several parties defending a litigation brought
by Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. alleging that
we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with
the plaintiffs, infringed the plaintiffs’ patents, engaged
in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against the
plaintiffs by, among other things, engaging in commercial
development and



exploitation of the plaintiffs’ patented
products and technology, separately and together with the other
defendants. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a
discussion of this matter.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful
indicator of future business prospects for any of our business
units due to the short lead time required on a majority of our
sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Because of the wide range of our products and
services, we face many different types of competition and
competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and
services and the prices at which these products and services are
sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic
organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and
services, and that may have greater financial and other
resources than we do, to small concerns producing a limited
number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

In our Life Sciences reporting segment, we
compete on the basis of service level, price, product
availability and reliability. Competitors range from
multinational organizations with a wide range of products to
specialized firms that in some cases have well established
market niches. We compete in these markets on the basis of
innovative technologies, product differentiation and quality. We
expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting
segment to increase through the continued consolidation of
competitors.

No single competitor competes directly with our
Analytical Instruments reporting segment as a whole. We compete
with instrument companies that serve particular segments of
markets in industrial instrumentation. We compete in this
segment primarily on the basis of product performance, product
reliability, service and price.

No single competitor competes directly with our
Optoelectronics reporting segment across its full product range.
However, we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies
in the products and sale of specialty flashtubes and
ultraspecialty lighting sources, photodetectors and photodiodes
and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price,
technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product
reliability and quality.

Competition in our Fluid Sciences reporting
segment is typically based on product performance and
innovation, quality, service and price. In a few markets,
competitors are large, diversified engineering and manufacturing
concerns. Most of our competitors, however, are small
specialized manufacturing companies offering limited product
lines for narrow market segments. Competition for lubricant
testing services is primarily from one large non-profit
institute and some customer-owned laboratories, and is mainly
based on quality and price.

We believe we compete effectively in each of the
areas in which our reporting segments experience competition.

Research and Development

PerkinElmer-sponsored research and development
expenditures were approximately $86.5 million during 2002,
approximately $80.1 million during 2001 and approximately
$76.1 million during 2000.

We directed our research and development efforts
in both 2002 and 2001 primarily in the drug discovery tools and
genetic screening applications markets, as well as the
biopharmaceutical markets within our Life Sciences and
Analytical Instruments reporting segments, and in the biomedical
markets within our Optoelectronics reporting segment.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign,
federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and
regulations. These requirements include those governing
emissions and discharges of hazardous substances,



the remediation of contaminated soil and
groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials and the
health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, and
comparable state statutes that impose liability for
investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to
fault, in connection with materials that we or our former
businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred,
and will continue to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental
investigations and remedial actions at current and former
locations and, along with other companies, have been named a
potentially responsible party for specific waste disposal sites.
We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period in
which our responsibility is established and when the cost can be
reasonably estimated. We have accrued $7.1 million as of
December 29, 2002, representing management’s estimate
of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental
matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any
recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification
arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of
variables, including the stage of the environmental
investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the
nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several
liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur and
the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites
where we are named a potentially responsible party, management
does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result
from the inability of other significant named parties to
contribute. We expect that such accrued amounts could be paid
out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and
remediation activities progress at each individual site, we
review these liabilities and adjust them to reflect additional
information as it becomes available. There have been no
environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to
have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. While it is possible that we may incur
a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded, the potential
exposure is not expected to be materially different than the
amounts recorded.

In connection with our acquisitions, we may
become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or
liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or
regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws or the
discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur
additional costs.

Employees

As of December 29, 2002, we employed
approximately 10,700 employees in our continuing operations.
Several of our subsidiaries, with an aggregate of approximately
1,400 employees as of December 29, 2002, are parties to
contracts with labor unions. We consider our relations with
employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Reporting
Segments

The table below sets forth sales and operating
profit (loss) by reporting segment for 2002, for 2001 and for
2000:



Our Security and Detection Systems,
Telecommunications Component, and Entertainment Lighting
businesses are discontinued operations and therefore have not
been included in the preceding table. The results for the
periods presented above include certain acquisition charges,
restructuring charges and other items, which are discussed in
this annual report on Form 10-K under the heading
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

Additional information relating to our reporting
segments is as follows:



Financial Information About Geographic
Areas

The following geographic area information for
continuing operations includes sales based on location of
external customer and net property, plant and equipment based on
physical location:

Each of our reporting segments conducts business
in, and derives substantial revenue from various countries
outside the United States. During 2002, we had
$782.4 million in sales from our international operations,
representing approximately 52% of our total sales. During 2002,
we derived approximately 44% of our international sales from our
Analytical Instruments reporting segment, approximately 32% of
our international sales from our Life Sciences reporting
segment, approximately 20% of our international sales from our
Optoelectronics reporting segment, and approximately 4% of our
international sales from our Fluid Sciences reporting segment.
We anticipate that sales from international operations will
continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.

We are exposed to the risks associated with
international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations,
regional and country-specific political and economic conditions,
foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection
measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks,
staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property
protection risks and differing regulatory requirements.



Item 2.

Properties

As of December 29, 2002, our continuing
operations occupied approximately 3,572,000 square feet of
building area. We own approximately 1,311,000 square feet of
this space and lease the balance. Our headquarters occupies
53,000 square feet of leased space in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
Our other operations are conducted in manufacturing and assembly
plants, research laboratories, administrative offices and other
facilities located in nine states and 39 foreign countries.

Non-United States facilities account for
approximately 1,594,000 square feet of our owned and leased
property, or approximately 45% of our total occupied space.

Our real property leases are both short-term and
long-term. We believe that our properties are well-maintained
and are adequate for our present requirements.

The following table indicates, as of
December 29, 2002, the approximate square footage of real
property owned and leased attributable to each of our reporting
segments for continuing operations:

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to various claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters
that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities.
Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and
it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved in a
manner that is unfavorable to us.

We and our subsidiary, EG&G Idaho, Inc., were
served with a complaint in 1998 naming us as defendants in a
lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the
District of Idaho. Filed by two former employees of EG&G
Idaho under the Civil False Claims Act, the suit named as
defendants several entities that were formerly prime contractors
or subcontractors to the United States Department of Energy at
the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The
plaintiffs allege that we and the other defendants submitted
false claims to the government for reimbursement of costs and
payment to award fees related to environmental activities that
the defendants knew or should have known had either not been
performed or were performed improperly. In a series of orders
issued in response to various defense motions, the District
Court dismissed most, but not all, of the allegations involving
us. The plaintiffs have indicated an intent to appeal the
District Court’s rulings, but cannot do so until the
remaining allegations have reached a final disposition. The
plaintiffs have yet to quantify the damages they are seeking.

Our subsidiary, EG&G Rocky Flats, Inc., and
two other companies were served with a complaint in January 2000
naming EG&G Rocky Flats, Inc. as a defendant in a civil
false claim action pending in the United States District Court
for the District of Colorado, involving alleged false claims
arising out of security issues at the United States Department
of Energy’s Rocky Flats Plant. In response to a motion
filed by the United States Department of Justice, the District
Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs have appealed the
dismissal, and the appeal was argued before the United States
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in January 2003.

On July 1, 2002, Kevin Hatch filed a
purported class action lawsuit in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civil Action
No. 02-11314 GAO, against the Company and Gregory L.
Summe, the Company’s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer and President, and Robert F. Friel,



the Company’s Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, on behalf of himself and purchasers of
the Company’s common stock between July 15, 2001 and
April 11, 2002. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of
damages and claims violations of Sections 10(b), 10b-5 and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging various
statements made during the putative class period by the Company
and its management were misleading with respect to the
Company’s prospects and future operating results. At least
eleven virtually identical lawsuits were subsequently filed in
the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts against the Company. The Court granted
plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate these matters, and, on
January 13, 2003, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On
February 24, 2003, defendants served a motion to dismiss
the lawsuit. Plaintiffs will serve an opposition to
defendants’ motion to dismiss on or before April 7,
2003. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the
lawsuit and intends to contest the action vigorously. The
Company is currently unable, however, to determine whether
resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on
its financial position or results of operations, or reasonably
estimate the amount of the loss, if any, that may result from
resolution of this matter.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo
Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (“Enzo”)
filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448,
against Amersham PLC, Amersham Biosciences, PerkinElmer, Inc.,
PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,
Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid
Biosciences, Inc. The six count complaint alleges that we have
breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with
Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair
competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by,
among other things, engaging in commercial development and
exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology,
separately and together with the other defendants. Other
defendants have alleged or may allege that we have an indemnity
obligation for costs and damages arising out of this action.
Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief.

We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these
matters. We are currently unable, however, to determine whether
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact
on our financial position or results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following management discussion and
analysis contains forward-looking information that you should
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have
included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions
or expectations we disclose in the forward-looking statements we
make. We have included important factors below under the heading
“Forward-Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future
Performance” that we believe could cause actual results to
differ materially from the forward-looking statements we
make.

Overview

We are a leading provider of scientific
instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical,
biomedical, environmental testing and general industrial
markets. We design, manufacture, market and service products and
systems within three business units:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

We are a leading provider of drug
    discovery, genetic screening, environmental and chemical
    analysis tools and instrumentation. Our Life and Analytical
    Sciences business unit comprises our Life Sciences reporting
    segment and our Analytical Instruments reporting segment.

•

Optoelectronics.

We
    provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty
    lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products
    and other specialty end markets. Our Optoelectronics business
    unit constitutes a single reporting segment.

•

Fluid Sciences.

We
    provide critical fluid control and containment solutions for
    highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and
    semiconductor fabrication facilities. Our Fluid Sciences
    business unit constitutes a single reporting segment.

Formation of our Life and Analytical
    Sciences business

During the fourth quarter of 2002, we combined
our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units into
a new integrated business named Life and Analytical Sciences. We
combined our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses
to improve our operational scale, which we believe will enable
us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on
the strengths of the businesses’ sales, service and
research and development organizations. Our Life and Analytical
Sciences business unit comprised two reporting segments for the
years presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. In
connection with the formation of our Life and Analytical
Sciences business unit and expected near-term pressure on
capital expenditures within certain key end markets, we recorded
a $26.0 million restructuring charge as a result of
workforce reductions, facility closures and contract
terminations that we expect to make. We expect many of these
actions to occur during 2003. The combination of these
businesses will require changes to our organizational structure,
processes and systems over the next year. We are targeting
annualized pre-tax cost savings from the combination of between
$30.0 million and $45.0 million beginning in 2004,
with interim pre-tax cost savings of between $12.0 million
and $25.0 million in 2003. We cannot assure you that we
will achieve any of these cost savings.



2002 Refinancing Transactions

In December 2002, we completed a series of
related debt refinancing transactions for the purpose of
extending our existing average debt maturities. These
transactions included:

•

Establishing a new senior secured credit facility
    comprising:

—

a $315.0 million six-year term loan and

—

a $100.0 million five-year revolving credit
    facility,

Following these transactions, at
December 29, 2002, we had $186.5 million in aggregate
accreted amount of outstanding zero coupon debentures and
$4.7 million in outstanding 6.8% notes.

At December 29, 2002, we had a total of
$186.5 million of the proceeds from the sale of our
8 7/8% notes and our new term loan held in escrow to retire
substantially all of the remaining zero coupon debentures. We
may redeem some or all of the zero coupon debentures at any time
on or after August 7, 2003 at a redemption price equal to
the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount through
the redemption date. Under the terms of our new senior credit
facility, we are required to redeem in the third quarter of 2003
all of the zero coupon debentures outstanding at that time.
Prior to August 7, 2003, we may from time to time
repurchase outstanding zero coupon debentures through open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise. Accordingly, the zero coupon debentures are shown as
current liabilities on our December 29, 2002 balance sheet.

On March 1, 2002, we redeemed all
$118.2 million outstanding of our 9.375% notes due March
2007 for aggregate consideration of $123.5 million,
resulting in a $5.5 million loss on the extinguishment. The
indenture governing the 9.375% notes established the 104.688%
redemption rate we paid in this transaction. We assumed the
9.375% notes as part of our November 2001 acquisition of Packard
BioScience Company.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Significant Acquisitions

In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of
Packard BioScience Company for a purchase price of approximately
$764.0 million, primarily in the form of approximately
22 million shares of our common stock and our assumption of
approximately $118.2 million in debt which we subsequently
redeemed in March 2002. The acquisition extended our
capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation
and strengthened our position as a global provider of
comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions. Packard
generated sales of approximately $165.0 million for its
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

In July 2000, we completed our acquisition of NEN
Life Sciences, Inc., a provider of state-of-the-art drug
discovery products, services, reagents and technologies to the
life sciences industry, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $418.0 million. In connection with the
acquisition, we paid approximately $350.0 million in cash
and issued warrants to purchase approximately 600,000 shares of
our common stock. In addition, we repaid approximately
$50.0 million of outstanding indebtedness of NEN. We
financed the



acquisition and repayment of the outstanding
indebtedness with $410.0 million of commercial paper
borrowings with a weighted-average interest rate of 7%. We
repaid these short-term borrowings in August 2000 with proceeds
from the issuance of our zero coupon convertible debentures.

Significant Divestitures and Discontinued
    Operations

During October 2001, our Board of Directors
approved a plan to sell our Fluid Sciences business unit, at
which time the business was reflected as a discontinued
operation in our consolidated financial statements in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30,
“Reporting the Results of Operations — Reporting
the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions.” As of the third quarter of 2002, we had not
completed the sale of the business due to external market
conditions. As APB No. 30 affords one year for the
completion of a disposition, we have reflected the Fluid
Sciences business unit within our consolidated results from
continuing operations for 2002 and adjusted all other periods
reported in this annual report on Form 10-K to reflect this
change.

In June 2002, our Board of Directors approved a
plan to shut down our Telecommunications Component business and
a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business as part of
our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities.
Both businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations
in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,”
which we adopted as of the beginning of 2002.

In June 2001, our Board of Directors approved a
plan to sell our Security and Detection Systems business. In
June 2002, we completed the sale of our Security and Detection
Systems business to L-3 Communications. We received cash
proceeds in this transaction of approximately
$100.0 million. These proceeds are subject to a working
capital adjustment, which we do not expect to be material. Our
consolidated financial statements reflect the business and the
associated effect of the disposition as a discontinued operation
in accordance with APB No. 30.

Consolidated Results of Continuing
Operations

Sales

2002 Compared to 2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$1,505.0 million versus $1,525.3 million during 2001,
a decrease of $20.4 million or 1%. The decrease in year
over year sales was due primarily to lost sales from divested
businesses and declines in sales within key end markets, offset
by the inclusion of Packard’s results for a full year and
favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales in 2001
included $93.3 million from businesses we have divested.
Sales for 2001 would have been approximately $165.0 million
higher had Packard been included for the first 10 months of
the year. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales in
2002 by approximately $22.0 million. Key end markets
contributing to the year over year decline in sales included
pharmaceutical research and development markets within our Life
Sciences reporting segment, several general analytical markets
served by our Analytical Instruments reporting segment, the
fiber optic test and ultra-specialty lighting markets within our
Optoelectronics reporting segment and the aerospace and
semiconductor assembly markets within our Fluid Sciences
reporting segment. These declines were partially offset by
increased sales within the genetic screening and digital imaging
markets and increased sales of consumables and related services.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Sales for 2001 were
$1,525.3 million versus $1,538.0 million during 2000,
a decrease of $12.6 million or less than 1%. The decrease
in year over year sales was due primarily to lost sales from
divested businesses and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange
rates, offset to some extent by the inclusion of NEN’s
results for a full year and Packard’s results for two
months, as well as increased sales within our genetic screening
and drug discovery tools businesses. Our divestiture of
businesses in 2001 and 2000 resulted in a $63.9 million
decline in sales during 2001, while foreign exchange rate
changes reduced sales by approximately $30.0 million. 2001
sales included Packard’s results for two months, which
totaled $40.0 million. 2000 sales would have been
approximately $70.0 million higher had NEN been included
for the first seven months of the year.



Cost of Sales

2002 Compared to 2001.

Cost of sales for 2002 was
$904.1 million versus $849.4 million for 2001, an
increase of $54.7 million or 6%. As a percentage of sales,
cost of sales increased to 60% in 2002 from 56% in 2001. The
increase in cost of sales was due primarily to unabsorbed
manufacturing expenses, unfavorable product mix from the sale of
lower margin instruments and increases in material and labor
costs. The unabsorbed manufacturing expenses resulted from
decreased production and lower capacity utilization as a result
of lower sales and lower inventory. The increase in cost of
sales was offset by benefits from the reduction and relocation
of facilities and headcount reductions. Included in 2002 cost of
sales was a $17.2 million write-off of inventory associated
with the Optoelectronics reporting segment and $1.5 million
related to the amortization of the write-up associated with
Packard inventory included as part of purchase accounting.
Included in the cost of sales for 2001 were $7.4 million in
costs associated with relocating manufacturing facilities to
lower cost geographies and an additional $1.5 million
related to the amortization of the write-up of inventory from
the Packard acquisition.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Cost of sales was $849.4 million
for 2001 versus $892.4 million during 2000, a decrease of
$43.0 million or 5%. As a percentage of sales, cost of
sales decreased to 56% in 2001 from 58% during 2000. The
decrease in cost of sales was due primarily to lower headcount,
the reduction and relocation of facilities, and strategic moves
into higher margin businesses. Included in 2001 cost of sales
were $7.4 million from the cost of relocating manufacturing
facilities to lower cost geographies and $1.5 million
related to the amortization of the write-up of Packard inventory
included as part of purchase accounting. Included in 2000 cost
of sales were $1.8 million in charges associated with
reorganization activities and $1.8 million from the
write-up of inventory acquired as part of the NEN acquisition.

Research and Development
    Expenses

2002 Compared to 2001.

Research and development expenses for
2002 were $86.5 million versus $80.1 million in 2001,
an increase of $6.4 million or 8%. As a percentage of
sales, research and development expenses increased to 6% in 2002
from 5% in 2001, principally as a result of the inclusion of
spending associated with the Packard operations. We directed
research and development efforts during both 2002 and 2001
primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic screening
applications as well as biopharmaceutical end markets within the
Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments and
biomedical end markets within the Optoelectronics reporting
segment. We expect research and development to continue to
approximate historical levels with future efforts directed
principally in the health sciences end markets.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Research and development expenses for
2001 were $80.1 million versus $76.1 million in 2000,
an increase of $4.0 million or 5%. As a percentage of
sales, research and development expenses were 5% in both 2001
and 2000. We directed research and development efforts during
2001 primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic screening
applications, as well as biopharmaceutical end markets within
the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments
and biomedical end markets within the Optoelectronics reporting
segment. We directed research and development efforts during
2000 primarily toward drug discovery tools, genetic screening
applications and pharmaceutical end markets within the Life
Sciences reporting segment.

In-Process Research and Development
    Expenses

In-process research and development expenses for
2001 were $71.5 million and consisted of $69.0 million
from our acquisition of Packard within our Life Sciences
reporting segment and $2.5 million from our acquisition of
Applied Surface Technology within our Fluid Sciences reporting
segment. In-process research and development expenses for 2000
were $24.3 million from our acquisition of NEN within our
Life Sciences reporting segment. In all instances, we deemed the
in-process research and development to have no future
alternative use at the date of purchase.



Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses

2002 Compared to 2001.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses for 2002 were $431.3 million versus
$376.9 million for 2001, an increase of $54.4 million
or 14%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses increased to 29% in 2002 from 25% in
2001. The increase resulted from unfavorable changes in foreign
exchange rates, the inclusion of costs associated with Packard
operations and increased investments made in the sales and
marketing function in 2002. Our selling, general and
administrative expenses for 2002 included $3.3 million
associated with the integration of Packard into the Life
Sciences reporting segment, while 2001 included
$7.5 million for incentive payments associated with
acquisitions and divestitures, $6.0 million in other
acquisition-related charges and $4.2 million for costs of
integrating administrative functions for each of our Life
Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments and
relocating facilities to lower cost geographies.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses for 2001 were $376.9 million versus
$364.5 million for 2000, an increase of $12.4 million
or 3%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses increased to 25% in 2001 from 24% in
2000. The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses resulted primarily from the inclusion of expenses
associated with Packard’s operations, investments made in
our sales and marketing function, offset by changes in foreign
exchange rates. The results from 2001 included charges of
$7.5 million for incentive payments associated with
acquisitions and divestitures, $6.0 million in other
acquisition-related charges and $4.2 million in charges
incurred in the integration of administrative functions in each
of the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting
segments and relocating facilities to lower cost geographies.
The results from 2000 included charges of $5.4 million in
similar integration charges mainly attributable to NEN.

Restructuring Charges, Net

2002 Compared to 2001.

Restructuring charges, net for 2002
were $35.7 million versus $7.0 million during 2001.
Our restructuring charges in 2002 included a $26.0 million
charge taken in connection with our decision to combine our Life
Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses into a single
business — Life and Analytical Sciences. This charge
consisted of approximately $20.8 million in severance
payments, $3.5 million in lease cancellation payments and
$1.7 million of asset writedowns. In addition, during 2002,
we took $9.2 million in net charges associated with
workforce reductions and manufacturing facility closures
stemming primarily from relocating to lower cost geographies and
reduction of our fixed costs. Our net restructuring charges in
2001 of $7.0 million related primarily to employee
separation costs associated with the consolidation of European
general and managerial functions within both our Life Sciences
and Analytical Instruments reporting segments.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Restructuring charges, net for 2001
were $7.0 million versus $6.3 million in 2000. Our
restructuring charges in 2001 related primarily to employee
separation costs associated with the consolidation of European
general and managerial functions within both our Life Sciences
and Analytical Instruments reporting segments. Restructuring
charges in 2000 related to the consolidation of offices and
manufacturing facilities, including associated employee
separation costs, as well as the disposal of excess capacity.

The following table summarizes our restructuring
accrual balances and related activity during 2002 and 2001:



We expect to settle the majority of the actions
remaining at December 29, 2002 in 2003, with the exception
of our European pension and severance obligations and a number
of lease obligations which may extend beyond 2003. We expect all
cash payments to be made using available cash.

Gains on Dispositions

2002 Compared to 2001.

Dispositions resulted in a net gain of
$5.2 million in 2002 versus a net gain of
$33.2 million in 2001. Gains on dispositions in 2002
included $4.4 million from sales of facilities and
$0.8 million from post closing adjustments relating to the
sale of our Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences
business, formerly part of our Analytical Instruments reporting
segment. Gains on dispositions in 2001 included
$32.3 million from the sale of our Instruments for Research
and Applied Sciences business and $7.2 million from
dispositions within our Optoelectronics and Analytical
Instruments reporting segments, offset by a $6.3 million
loss on the sale of our Voltarc Technologies business, formerly
part of our Optoelectronics reporting segment.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Dispositions resulted in a net gain of
$33.2 million for 2001 versus a net gain of
$37.7 million in 2000. The gain on dispositions in 2001
included $32.3 million from the sale of our Instruments for
Research and Applied Sciences business and $7.2 million
from dispositions in our Optoelectronics and Analytical
Instruments reporting segments, offset by the $6.3 million
loss from the sale of our Voltarc Technologies business. The
gain on dispositions in 2000 included approximately
$16.7 million on the sale of buildings, approximately
$10.0 million on the disposition of our Berthold business,
$7.2 million from other dispositions, primarily within the
Optoelectronics reporting segment, and $2.5 million
previously deferred from prior dispositions recognized as a
result of the resolution of outstanding contingent liabilities.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets

2002 Compared to 2001.

Amortization of intangible assets for
2002 was $28.3 million versus $43.9 million for 2001,
a decrease of $15.6 million or 36%. Of the 2001
amortization expense, $27.1 million related to the
amortization of goodwill in 2001. We discontinued the
amortization of goodwill with our adoption of SFAS No. 142
at the beginning of 2002. The year over year increase in
intangible asset amortization was the result of the amortization
on intangible assets other than goodwill that arose from the
acquisition of Packard.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Amortization of intangible assets for
2001 was $43.9 million versus $32.3 million for 2000,
an increase of $11.6 million or 36%. Within these amounts,
the amortization of goodwill accounted for $27.1 million in
2001 and $22.7 million in 2000. The increase reflects a
full year of amortization from the goodwill and intangible
assets associated with our acquisition of NEN completed in July
2000 and to a lesser extent, the amortization of intangible
assets in 2001 recorded as part of our acquisition of Packard.

Other Expense, Net

2002 Compared to 2001.

Other expense, net for 2002 was
$32.9 million versus $29.2 million for 2001, an
increase of $3.7 million or 13%. The increase in other
expense, net was due primarily to $8.7 million in premiums,
fees and write-offs of unamortized costs resulting from the
early extinguishment of debt during 2002, $2.5 million in
transaction costs incurred as part of the proposed sale of the
Fluid Sciences business, a $2.0 million loss on an equity
investment versus net gains of $4.3 million in 2001, and
other items totaling $4.1 million. Offsetting these amounts
were $8.4 million in gains realized on the repurchase of a
portion of the zero coupon convertible debentures, a year over
year decline in net interest expense of $5.1 million and a
$4.4 million gain realized on the termination of a fixed to
variable interest rate swap as a result of the tender offer for
our 6.8% notes. The $8.7 million in charges associated with
the early extinguishment of debt were comprised of a
$5.5 million call premium paid on the extinguishment of the
Packard debt called in the first quarter of 2002 and
$3.2 million in fees and previously capitalized issuance
costs written-off in connection with our December 2002 debt
refinancing transactions. A decline in interest expense to
$32.1 million in 2002 from $37.7 million in 2001 was
the result of decreased levels of indebtedness and lower
associated interest rates period over period. We expect interest
expense in 2003 to increase due to the debt we raised as part of
our 2002 debt refinancing transactions.



2001 Compared to 2000.

Other expense, net for 2001 was
$29.2 million versus $33.1 million in 2000, a decrease
of $3.9 million or 12%. Other expense, net for 2001
included gains realized on the sale of investments of
$4.3 million. The results from 2000 included similar gains
of $0.9 million. Interest expense for 2001 of
$37.7 million versus $37.4 million in 2000 was the
result of higher debt levels due to acquisition activity, offset
by lower borrowing costs. The remaining impact in each of the
years was attributable to foreign exchange losses.

Provision/ Benefit for Income
    Taxes

2002 Compared to 2001.

The benefit for income taxes for 2002
was $4.4 million versus a provision of $59.1 million
during 2001. Our 2002 effective tax rate of 52% is primarily
attributable to the geographic income patterns, reduced
profitability, permanent tax differences and use of foreign tax
credits in the United States. Our 2001 effective tax rate of 59%
was increased by the tax treatment of in-process research and
development charges associated with our Packard acquisition,
which were not deductible for tax purposes. Absent these items,
we would expect our effective tax rate to approximate 35%.

2001 Compared to 2000.

The provision for income taxes was
$59.1 million in 2001 versus $56.4 million in 2000.
Our 2001 tax rate was increased by the tax treatment of
in-process research and development charges associated with the
Packard acquisition, which were not deductible for tax purposes.
Our 2000 effective tax rate of 38% was impacted to a lesser
extent by similar in-process research and development charges.

Discontinued Operations

In June 2002, we sold our Security and Detection
Systems business to L-3 Communications. We received cash
proceeds in this transaction of approximately
$100.0 million at closing. The proceeds are subject to a
working capital adjustment, which we do not expect to be
material. We have reflected the business and the associated
impact of the disposition as a discontinued operation within our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with APB
No. 30. For the portion of 2002 prior to being sold, our
Security and Detection Systems business had sales of
$108.2 million.

Also in June 2002, our Board of Directors
approved a plan to shut down our Telecommunications Component
business and a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business
as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth
opportunities. We have reflected both businesses as discontinued
operations in our consolidated financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No. 144. As of June 30, 2002, we
had shut down our Telecommunications Component business. For
2002, our Telecommunications Component business had sales of
$1.7 million and our Entertainment Lighting business had
sales of $10.3 million.

Effect of Accounting Change

We adopted SFAS No. 142 as of the beginning
of fiscal 2002 and have accordingly ceased the amortization of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the
second quarter of 2002, we completed our transitional
implementation of the impairment of testing provisions of SFAS
No. 142, which resulted in a $117.8 million after-tax
charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit
within the Optoelectronics business unit. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142, we have taken this charge as
the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal
2002.

Contingencies

We are conducting a number of environmental
investigations and remedial actions at our current and former
locations and, along with other companies, have been named a
potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites.
We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that
our responsibility is established and when the cost can be
reasonably estimated. We have accrued $7.1 million as of
December 29, 2002, representing management’s estimate
of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental
matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any
recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification
arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of
variables, including the stage of the environmental
investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the
nature of the potential



remedies, possible joint and several liability,
the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible
effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we
have been named a potentially responsible party, management does
not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from
the inability of other significant named parties to contribute.
We expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a
period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation
activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities
are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as
it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems
to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect
on our financial position or results of operations. While it is
possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may
be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be
materially different from the amounts recorded.

We and certain of our officers have been named as
defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs
have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with
respect to our prospects and future operating results. We
believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we
intend to contest the actions vigorously. We are currently
unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss,
if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing
Operations

We report our continuing operations as four
reporting segments, reflecting our management methodology and
structure. Our Security and Detection Systems business,
previously reported as part of our Analytical Instruments
reporting segment, and our Telecommunications Component business
and Entertainment Lighting business, previously reported as part
of our Optoelectronics reporting segment, have been reflected as
discontinued operations in our consolidated financial
statements. The accounting policies of our reporting segments
are the same as those described in the footnotes to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. We evaluate
performance based on profitability of the respective reporting
segments. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of
the primary changes in operating results by reporting segment
for 2002 versus 2001 and for 2001 versus 2000.

Life Sciences

2002 Compared to 2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$494.3 million versus $346.1 million in 2001, an
increase of $148.2 million or 43%. Year over year sales
increased due primarily to the timing of the Packard
acquisition, increased sales in our genetic screening business
and increased sales in consumables and services. These increases
were offset in part by a decline in sales from drug discovery
instruments due to challenges within the pharmaceutical research
and development end markets. Sales in 2001 would have been
approximately $165.0 million higher had the results from
Packard been included for the first ten months of the year.

Operating profit for 2002 was $8.0 million
versus a loss of $46.4 million in 2001. The year over year
increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to the
inclusion of $21.7 million in charges in 2002 versus
$86.1 million in charges during 2001 principally associated
with acquisitions and restructurings. The operating profit for
2002 included $16.9 million in net restructuring charges,
including a $12.9 million charge taken in the fourth
quarter of 2002 for severance and facility closure actions
stemming from the combination of our Life Sciences and
Analytical Instruments businesses into a single
business — Life and Analytical Sciences. Additionally,
the operating profit from 2002 included $3.3 million in
costs incurred during the first quarter of 2002 as a result of
integration efforts and $1.5 million from the amortization
of inventory acquired as part of our acquisition of Packard. The
results from 2001 included a $69.0 million charge
associated with acquired in-process research and development,
$6.0 million in integration-related charges,
$3.4 million of net restructuring charges, a
$3.3 million integration incentive associated with the
Packard acquisition, a net $2.9 million in other charges
which include the settlement of pre-acquisition contingencies
from a prior acquisition and a $1.5 million charge for the
revaluation of acquired inventory. Lower production volumes,
which led to lower utilization of production capacity, and the
inclusion of Packard for the full year decreased operating
profit in 2002. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization
expenses were $21.2 million for 2002 and $23.7 million
for 2001.



2001 Compared to 2000.

Sales for 2001 were
$346.1 million versus $221.4 million for 2000, an
increase of $124.7 million or 56%. The timing of our
Packard and NEN acquisitions contributed to the increased sales
for 2001. Sales for 2001 included two months of results from
Packard, which totaled $40.0 million. Sales for 2000 would
have been approximately $70.0 million higher had NEN been
included for the first seven months of the year. The year over
year increase in sales was also attributable to increased sales
in our drug discovery tools and genetic screening businesses and
increased sales in related consumables resulting from new
product introductions and geographic expansions.

Operating loss for 2001 was $46.4 million
versus a loss of $3.6 million for 2000. The year over year
increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to the
inclusion of $86.1 million in charges during 2001 versus
$33.5 million in charges during 2000. The results from 2001
included a $69.0 million charge associated with acquired
in-process research and development, $6.0 million in
integration-related charges, $3.4 million of net
restructuring charges, a $3.3 million integration incentive
associated with our Packard acquisition, a net $2.9 million
in other charges which include the settlement of preacquisition
contingencies from a prior acquisition and a $1.5 million
charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory. 2000 operating
profit included a $24.3 million charge for acquired
in-process research and development, $3.9 million in
restructuring charges, $3.5 million in integration-related
charges associated with our NEN acquisition and a
$1.8 million charge for the revaluation of acquired
inventory. Sales of higher margin products and the benefit of
lower costs resulting from the consolidation of manufacturing
and administrative sites reduced the operating loss in 2001.
Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were
$23.7 million for 2001 and $9.3 million for 2000.

Analytical Instruments

2002 Compared to 2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$497.4 million versus $568.4 million for 2001, a
decrease of $71.0 million or 12%. The year over year
decrease was due primarily to business divestitures and declines
in sales due to weakness in the general analytical and
pharmaceutical end markets. These declines were offset by
favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and by increased
sales of consumables and services. Sales for 2001 included
$47.4 million in sales from our Instruments for Research
and Applied Science business which we divested in the fourth
quarter of 2001.

Operating profit for 2002 was $19.4 million
versus $77.8 million for 2001, a decrease of
$58.3 million or 75%. The year over year decrease in
operating profit was due primarily to the inclusion of
$9.4 million in charges during 2002 versus
$16.1 million in net gains during 2001, as well as lower
sales due to divested businesses, volume declines and associated
lower utilization of production capacity. Operating profit for
2002 included $14.6 million in net restructuring charges,
of which $13.1 million was taken in the fourth quarter in
connection with our decision to combine our Life Sciences and
Analytical Instruments businesses, as well as $5.2 million
in gains resulting from the final settlement of the disposition
of property and businesses divested in prior years. Operating
profit for 2001 included $32.1 million in gains realized on
the disposal of businesses, $8.4 million in reorganization
charges associated with relocations to lower cost geographies,
consolidation of European finance functions and relocations of
administrative and manufacturing facilities, a restructuring
charge of $5.3 million, and a $2.3 million incentive
payment associated with the successful completion of
divestitures. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense
was $4.4 million in 2002 and $10.5 million in 2001.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Sales for 2001 were
$568.4 million versus $617.7 million for 2000, a
decrease of $49.3 million or 8%. The year over year
decrease was due primarily to the disposition of our Berthold
business in late 2000, which had sales of approximately
$30.0 million in the year 2000.

Operating profit for 2001 was $77.8 million
versus $56.1 million in 2000, an increase of
$21.7 million or 39%. The year over year increase in
operating profit was due primarily to productivity enhancements
and cost containment actions. Results from 2001 included
$32.1 million in gains realized on the disposal of
businesses, $8.4 million in reorganization-related charges
associated with relocations to lower cost geographies,
consolidation of European finance functions and relocations of
administrative and manufacturing facilities, a restructuring
charge of $5.3 million and a $2.3 million incentive
payment associated with the successful completion of



the divestitures. Operating profit for 2000
included a $15.2 million gain from the sale of businesses.
Goodwill and intangible asset amortization was
$10.5 million for 2001 and $13.5 million for 2000.

Optoelectronics

2002 Compared to 2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$323.8 million versus $380.2 million for 2001, a
decrease of $56.4 million or 15%. The decrease in sales in
2002 was due primarily to the impact of divested businesses and
product lines which accounted for $39.4 million in sales
for 2001 and continued weakness in the semiconductor market
which more than offset growth in sales in the digital imaging
and sensors end markets.

Operating loss for 2002 was $4.0 million
versus an operating profit of $51.3 million for 2001. The
year over year decline in operating profit was due primarily to
a decline in sales due in part to divestitures, and lower
capacity utilization leading to unabsorbed manufacturing
expenses, partially offset by headcount reductions and the
reduction and relocation of facilities. 2002 operating loss
included an inventory write down of $17.2 million which was
taken during the first quarter of 2002 as the result of expected
lower sales volumes in several key markets. Additionally, 2002
operating loss included $3.7 million in net restructuring
charges related to facility closures and workforce reduction
actions. 2001 operating profit included a $5.5 million net
loss realized on the disposal of businesses,
reorganization-related charges of $4.9 million associated
with our further expansion and relocation into lower cost
manufacturing locations, a $1.8 million retention incentive
charge, and $3.0 million in other net credits related to
resolution of outstanding liabilities. Goodwill and intangible
asset amortization was $1.3 million for 2002 and
$7.0 million for 2001.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Sales for 2001 were
$380.2 million versus $447.1 million for 2000, a
decrease of $66.9 million or 15%. The decrease in sales in
2001 was due primarily to businesses and product lines divested
during 2000 and 2001, which accounted for $33.6 million
more in sales in 2000 than they did in 2001. The decrease in
sales also resulted from decreased sales in the photography and
semiconductor markets, offset by an increase in sales to the
digital imaging and sensors markets.

Operating profit for 2001 was $51.3 million
versus $96.1 million for 2000, a decrease of
$44.9 million or 47%. The year over year decline in
operating profit was attributable to the $9.2 million in
charges during 2001 versus $15.4 million in net gains
during 2000 and lower sales discussed above. The 2001 operating
profit included a $5.5 million net loss realized on the
disposal of businesses, reorganization-related charges of
$4.9 million associated with our further expansion and
relocation into lower cost manufacturing locations,
restructuring and other net credits of $3.0 million mainly
related to previously unresolved potential liabilities and a
$1.8 million retention incentive. The 2000 operating profit
included gains of $11.7 million from the sale of a
building, $6.7 million from the disposition of businesses
and other net credits of $3.0 million. Goodwill and
intangible amortization was $7.0 million for both years.

Fluid Sciences

2002 Compared to 2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$189.5 million versus $230.6 million for 2001, a
decrease of $41.1 million or 18%. The decrease in sales was
due primarily to weakness in the semiconductor assembly, fluid
testing and aerospace end markets, offset by growth in the power
generation end markets. The decline in sales was also a result
of the divestiture of two aerospace businesses which contributed
$6.6 million during 2001.

Operating profit for 2002 was $17.5 million
versus $57.3 million for 2001, a decrease of
$39.8 million or 69%. The decrease in operating profit was
due primarily to the decline in sales previously discussed and
the cost of relocating manufacturing to lower cost geographies
and, to a lesser extent, the impact of $2.1 million in net
one-time gains during 2001. The 2001 operating profit included
$6.6 million in gains from the sale of two businesses
during the first half of 2001, $2.5 million in reversals of
previously announced restructuring charges, and
$2.1 million in restructuring-related charges. Goodwill and
intangible amortization was $1.5 million for 2002 and
$2.7 million for 2001.

2001 Compared to 2000.

Sales for 2001 were
$230.6 million versus $251.8 million for 2000, a
decrease of $21.1 million or 8%. The decrease in sales in
2001 as compared to 2000 was due primarily to a decline in



sales to the semiconductor assembly markets,
partially offset by an increase in sales to the aerospace fluid
testing and power generation markets.

Operating profit for 2001 was $57.3 million
versus $45.1 million in 2000, an increase of
$12.2 million or 27%. The year over year increase in
operating profit resulted from increased sales of higher margin
products to the aerospace market and the inclusion of
$6.6 million in one-time gains in 2001. Operating profit
for 2001 included gains of $6.6 million associated with the
sale of two businesses disposed of during 2001,
$2.5 million in reversals of previously announced
restructuring charges, and $2.1 million in
restructuring-related charges. Operating profit for 2000
included $2.4 million in restructuring charges and
$0.4 million in restructuring-related charges, offset by
$2.8 million in gains from dispositions. Goodwill and
intangible asset amortization was $2.7 million in 2001 and
$2.5 million in 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses,
make capital expenditures and service our debt and other
long-term liabilities. Our principal sources of funds are from
our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt
markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations
will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses,
capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt. In the
long-term, we expect to use internally generated funds and
external sources to satisfy our debt and other long-term
liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the
availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

deterioration of sales due to weakness in several
    markets in which we sell our products and services,

•

changes in our working capital requirements, and

•

our ability to successfully repatriate cash
    balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling
    domestic obligations.

Principal factors that could affect our ability
to obtain cash from external sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in our new
    borrowings,

•

a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability
    to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall
    access to the corporate debt market, and

•

volatility in the markets for corporate debt.

Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2002

Operating Activities.

Net cash generated by continuing
operations operating activities was $108.2 million in 2002.
Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities
during 2002 was a decrease in working capital, which includes
accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, of
$97.4 million. The working capital decrease during 2002
reflects improved working capital management as well as a
$17.2 million inventory adjustment within our
Optoelectronics reporting segment, offset by a net decrease of
$8.0 million in proceeds from our receivable securitization
program. We decreased inventory levels by $48.2 million
during 2002, including the $17.2 million Optoelectronics
inventory adjustment, on lower sales volume. Non-cash items
contributing to the net loss during 2002 were $76.6 million
in depreciation and amortization charges, $19.5 million in
amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, accretion of
discounts and net gains from extinguishment of debt,
$3.2 million in non-cash restructuring actions, and
$2.6 million of stock-based compensation. Offsetting these
amounts were $35.4 million in non-cash benefits from
deferred taxes and $3.2 million in net gains from
dispositions and sales of investments. Cash outlays for accrued
expenses, restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled
$49.2 million during 2002, primarily as the result of
payments toward restructuring plans and the settlement of
payroll, professional fees, hedging and other obligations.



Investing
Activities.

In 2002, our investing
activities used $150.8 million of cash, including our use
of $186.5 million of cash held in escrow to retire
substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero
coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered as part of
our 2002 refinancing transactions. In 2002, we made capital
expenditures of $37.8 million mainly in the areas of
tooling and process improvement for the drug discovery tools
business and other products for biopharmaceutical applications.
We also expended $30.0 million in the settlement of a lease
obligation on our Fremont, California facility resulting in our
purchase of this facility. Net proceeds from the dispositions of
businesses and fixed assets during 2002 of $126.0 million
were primarily from approximately $96.2 million in net
proceeds received from the sale of our Security and Detection
Systems business during the second quarter of 2002 and
approximately $29.8 million associated with the sale of
facilities. Cash outflows of $22.5 million associated with
acquisitions related primarily to the settlement of liabilities
incurred in connection with the Packard acquisition.

Financing Activities.

In 2002, we generated
$30.7 million of net cash from financing activities. Our
debt levels increased by $81.4 million to
$805.5 million at December 29, 2002. Included in this
amount is $186.5 million of our outstanding indebtedness
under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not
tendered as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions for which
we had $186.5 million of cash held in escrow at
December 29, 2002 for the purpose of retiring. After
consideration of the cash held in escrow, our debt decreased by
$105.1 million. Because we anticipate that the cash held in
escrow will be used to repurchase outstanding zero coupon
debentures in 2003, we believe that an understanding of our debt
levels after consideration of the escrow provides useful
information to investors regarding our financial condition.
Reductions in debt included $110.3 million of 2005 notes
and $304.3 million of zero coupon convertible debentures,
both of which we repurchased as part of our 2002 debt
refinancing transactions. Debt reductions in 2002 also included
$118.2 million of 9.375% senior subordinated ten-year notes
issued by Packard in March 1997, which we repurchased at a rate
of 104.688%, and $5.5 million in other credit facilities we
paid down during 2002. Offsetting these reductions was our
December 2002 issuance of senior subordinated notes which
generated proceeds of $297.5 million and our establishment
of a term loan which generated proceeds of $315.0 million.
In connection with these debt issuances and terminations, we
paid $15.8 million in fees during 2002. We also paid
$35.3 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds
from the exercise of employee stock options and participation in
our employee stock purchase plan of $13.1 million in 2002.

Fiscal Year 2001

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing
operations operating activities was $145.3 million in 2001.
Non-cash items impacting net income during 2001 were
depreciation and amortization of $88.5 million, an
in-process research and development charge of
$71.5 million, $20.8 million in deferred debt issuance
and accretion of discount costs, $5.6 million in changes of
deferred tax balances and $3.5 million stock-based
compensation charges offset by $40.7 million in gains on
dispositions and sale of investments, net and a
$1.8 million non-cash restructuring credit. An increase in
working capital resulted in a net use of $16.8 million
during 2001. Included in the working capital change for 2001 was
a $35.5 million increase in inventory due to lower than
planned sales in a number of the reporting segments, primarily
in our Optoelectronics reporting segment, and inventory safety
stock for production. This was partially offset by a
$18.2 million reduction in accounts receivable which was
net of $37.0 million from the receivable securitization
program discussed below. Also impacting cash provided by
operating activities during 2001 was a $41.9 million
reduction in accrued expenses, restructuring and other assets
and liabilities. Offsetting these amounts was $15.0 million
from the tax benefit from the exercise of common stock options.

Investing Activities.

In 2001, we generated
$76.7 million of net cash from investing activities. Cash
flow from the sale of businesses, primarily Instruments for
Research and Applied Science and Voltarc, was $73.5 million
and from the monetization of assets was $61.2 million for
2001. Monetization of assets consisted of the sale and the
sale-leaseback of facilities and equipment. Costs of
acquisitions, net of cash acquired, generated $34.1 million
of cash in 2001, principally from the Packard acquisition.
Capital expenditures were $94.4 million in 2001, and
related in large part to equipment, process improvement and
maintenance associated with increasing productivity and capacity
within the business of drug discovery tools and other biomedical
applications, as well as leasehold improvements in a number of
manufacturing facilities.



Financing Activities.

In 2001, we used $170.8 million
of net cash from financing activities. Cash flows generated
through operating and investing activities, along with net
proceeds of $37.7 million from the exercise of stock
options, were used in part to reduce short-term commercial paper
borrowings by $177.0 million during 2001. Cash utilized in
the payment of dividends to common stockholders totaled
$28.3 million during 2001.

Borrowing Arrangements

Senior Secured Credit
Facility.

In December 2002, we entered
into a new senior credit facility. This facility comprises a
six-year term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a
$100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility. This
credit facility is secured primarily by a substantial portion of
our and our subsidiaries’ domestic assets.

The interest rates under the senior credit
facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit
facility are determined as a margin over either the Eurodollar
rate or the base rate. The base rate is the higher of
(1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by
Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus
50 basis points. The applicable margin for the term loan is
400 basis points for the Eurodollar rate and 300 basis points
for the base rate. The applicable margin for the revolving
credit facility is determined based upon our leverage ratio for
the prior quarter. We may allocate all or a portion of our
indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based
upon the margin over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At
December 29, 2002, the Eurodollar rate was approximately
140 basis points and the base rate was 425 basis points.
The term loan is repayable in nominal quarterly installments
until December 2007, and thereafter in four equal quarterly
installments until December 2008. The revolving credit facility
is available to us through December 2007 for our working capital
needs. At December 29, 2002, we had no outstanding
principal balance under the revolving credit facility.

Our senior credit facility contains covenants
that require us to maintain specific financial ratios, including:

As of December 29, 2002, we were in
compliance with all applicable covenants.

8 7/8% Notes.

In December 2002, we issued and sold
ten-year senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with
a face value of $300.0 million. We received
$297.5 million in gross proceeds from the issuance.
Deferred issuance costs of $7.0 million were recorded as a
non-current asset. The debt, which matures in January 2013, is
unsecured, but is guaranteed by substantially all of our
domestic subsidiaries. Interest on our 8 7/8% notes is
payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15,
beginning July 15, 2003. If a change of control occurs,
each holder of 8 7/8% notes may require us to repurchase
some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of
the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest. Before
January 15, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
principal amount of our 8 7/8% notes with the net proceeds
of specified public equity offerings at 108.875% of the
principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains
outstanding after the redemption. We may redeem some or all of
our 8 7/8% notes at any time on or after January 15,
2008, at a redemption price of 104.438%. The redemption price
decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009, to 101.479% on
January 15, 2010 and to 100% on January 15, 2011. The
debt is subordinated to our new senior credit facility and other
existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. Our
8 7/8% notes contain financial and other covenants. Most of
these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment
grade rating by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and
Moody’s Investors Service. At December 29, 2002, we
were in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures.

In August 2000, we sold zero coupon
convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price of
$460.0 million. We used the offering’s net proceeds of
approximately $448.0 million to repay a portion of our
commercial paper borrowings, which had been increased temporarily



to finance the NEN acquisition. The zero coupon
convertible debentures are due August 2020 and were priced with
a yield to maturity of 3.5%. During 2002, we repurchased
$106.5 million of our zero coupon convertible debentures in
open market transactions, recognizing a gain of
$8.4 million in the process. As part of our 2002 debt
refinancing transactions, we commenced an offer to purchase any
and all of our existing zero coupon convertible debentures. As
of December 29, 2002, we had completed the tender offer and
repurchased $205.6 million in aggregate accreted amount of
the issue. The remaining $186.5 million in aggregate
accreted amount at December 29, 2002 will either be
repurchased prior to the first available call date of
August 3, 2003, through open-market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise, or called by us
thereafter. Under the terms of our new senior credit facility,
we are required to redeem all of the zero coupon debentures
remaining outstanding on August 7, 2003. Accordingly, our
zero coupon debentures are shown as current liabilities on our
December 29, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In December 2002, we deposited
$186.5 million in escrow to retire substantially all our
outstanding zero coupon debentures. Assuming all of the zero
coupon debentures outstanding at December 29, 2002 remain
outstanding at August 7, 2003, our redemption of those zero
coupon debentures would require $190.5 million on that
date. We expect to use available cash to satisfy our obligations
on the zero coupon debentures in excess of the escrow amount.
Through March 11, 2003, we have repurchased
$32.5 million of accreted value of our outstanding zero
coupon debentures in open market transactions using a portion of
the funds held in escrow.

6.8% Notes.

In
October 1995, we issued $115.0 million in notes bearing an
interest rate of 6.8% and maturing in 2005. Interest on the 6.8%
notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and
October 15. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the fixed
rate on these notes was swapped to a floating rate using a swap
instrument which reset semi-annually in arrears based upon
six-month USD LIBOR. As part of our 2002 debt refinancing
transactions, we initiated a tender offer for all of the
outstanding 6.8% notes. As of December 29, 2002, we had
completed the tender offer and repurchased all but
$4.7 million of these notes. We paid consent payments
pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the
tender offer. The consent solicitation eliminated substantially
all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture
governing our 6.8% notes. We may from time to time repurchase
outstanding 6.8% notes through open market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise. In connection with this
tender offer, we extinguished the swap arrangement and recorded
a $4.4 million gain on the extinguishment.

Packard Notes.

In
November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard and
assumed approximately $118.2 million of senior subordinated
ten-year notes issued in March 1997. We redeemed the notes on
March 1, 2002 at a rate of 104.688% in accordance with the
indenture dated as of March 4, 1997. As such, this amount
was reclassified to short-term on our December 30, 2001
balance sheet for presentation purposes. In connection with this
redemption, we realized a loss of $5.5 million as a result
of the call premium paid to the holders of the notes.

Receivables Securitization Facility

In December 2001, we established a wholly-owned
consolidated subsidiary to purchase, on a revolving basis,
certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously
sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a
financial institution. As collections reduce the accounts
receivable balances, new receivables are sold. Our consolidated
subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables.
Under the terms of this arrangement, we retain collection and
administrative responsibilities for the balances. The accounts
receivable securitization facility provides for up to
$51.0 million in accounts receivable funding. The facility
has an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 140
basis points as of December 29, 2002. Amounts funded by the
counterparty under this facility were $29.0 million at
December 29, 2002 and $37.0 million at
December 30, 2001. The facility includes conditions that
require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or
above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services,
and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors Service.
At December 29, 2002, we had a senior unsecured credit
rating of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services, and of Ba2 with a stable outlook
from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2003, we entered
into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable
securitization facility to January 31, 2004.



Dividends

Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly
cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2002
and 2001, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per
share. Our senior credit facility and the indenture governing
our outstanding 8 7/8% senior subordinated notes contain
restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular cash
dividend.

Stock Split

At our 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our
stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized
shares of our common stock from 100,000,000 shares to
300,000,000 shares. On April 24, 2001, our Board of
Directors approved a two-for-one stock split. The stock split
has been retroactively reflected in this annual report on
Form 10-K.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual
obligations at December 29, 2002, and the effects we expect
those obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flow in
future periods.

(1)

In December 2002, we deposited
    $186.5 million of unused proceeds from our new
    $315.0 million term loan and our sale of
    $300.0 million of 8 7/8% notes in escrow to retire the
    remainder of our outstanding zero coupon debentures. We may
    redeem some or all of our remaining zero coupon debentures at
    any time on or after August 7, 2003, at a redemption price
    equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue
    discount through the redemption date. Under the terms of our new
    senior credit facility, we are required to redeem in the third
    quarter of 2003 any remaining zero coupon debentures outstanding
    at that time. At December 29, 2002, the outstanding zero
    coupon debentures had an aggregate accreted amount of
    $186.5 million. At the time we redeem or otherwise
    repurchase the outstanding zero coupon debentures, the escrow
    amount may be less than the aggregate accreted amount of the
    zero coupon debentures. We expect to use available cash to
    redeem our outstanding zero coupon debentures with a redemption
    price exceeding the escrow amount. The accreted value at
    August 7, 2003 of the remaining zero coupon debentures
    outstanding at December 29, 2002 would be
    $190.5 million. However, through March 1, 2003, we
    have repurchased $32.5 million of accreted value of our
    outstanding zero coupon debentures in open market transactions
    using a portion of our funds held in escrow.

During 2003, we expect to make capital
expenditures of approximately $40 million primarily for the
introduction of new products, the improvement of operating
processes and the shift of production capacity to lower cost
geographies. We expect to use our available cash and internally
generated funds to fund these expenditures.



Change in Accounting Principle and New
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Under SFAS
No. 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
are no longer systematically amortized, but instead are subject
to periodic impairment testing which, at a minimum, will occur
on an annual basis. We adopted SFAS No. 142 as of the
beginning of fiscal 2002 and have accordingly ceased the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
During the second quarter of 2002, we completed our transitional
implementation of the impairment testing provisions of SFAS
No. 142, which resulted in a $117.8 million after-tax
charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit
within our Optoelectronics business unit. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142, we took this charge as the
effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal
2002. As part of our ongoing compliance with the SFAS
No. 142, we will perform our annual assessment during the
first quarter.

Our consolidated financial statements also
reflect our early adoption of SFAS No. 145,
“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections as of July 2, 2002.” Accordingly, we
reflected the gains and losses resulting from our retirement of
debt during 2002 in other expense, net within our consolidated
income statements rather than as “extraordinary items.”

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities,” which nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3. SFAS
No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated
with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred, whereas EITF No. 94-3 had recognized
the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan. We are
required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 effective
for exit or disposal activities initiated by us after
December 30, 2002. SFAS No. 146 does not affect the
restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2002.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure — an amendment
of FASB Statement No. 123”. SFAS No. 148 amends
SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition
for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 148 have been implemented in Note 1 and
Note 18 to the accompanying financial statements, and the
interim reporting requirements will be adopted in the first
interim period in 2003. We have not determined whether we will
undertake a change to the fair value method in the near future.
As our supplemental disclosure in Note 1 and Note 18
indicates, our adoption of the fair value provisions of SFAS
No. 123 would have a negative effect on our Consolidated
Income Statements.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” EITF Issue
No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The
provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue
arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2003. We are currently evaluating but have not yet
determined the effect that the adoption of EITF Issue
No. 00-21 will have on our results of operations and
financial condition.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.”
FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be
consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the
equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics
of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient
equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities
created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable
interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1,
2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the
first interim or annual period beginning after June 15,
2003. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption
of FIN 46 will have on our results of operations and
financial condition.



Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments,
intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and
other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and
litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We record product sales when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. We analyze our
installation requirements and record revenue only when
installation is perfunctory; in instances where installation is
necessary to ensure the functionality of the product, we do not
recognize revenue until the product is installed. A provision is
made at the time sales are recognized for the cost of any
perfunctory installation obligations and the estimated cost of
product warranties. We estimate product warranty obligations
based on labor and material costs we incur within the one year
warranty period. Future changes in warranty costs could decrease
or increase our earnings. Because the majority of our sales
relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than
long-term customized projects, we generally do not experience
significant changes in original estimates.

As discussed, in “Change in Accounting
Principle and New Accounting Pronouncements” above, we will
be required in the third quarter of 2003, to implement
EITF 00-21. This standard may impact our revenue
recognition methodology as described above. We are currently
assessing this impact.

Allowances for doubtful
accounts.

We maintain allowances for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We
generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by
(1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that
are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically
reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty.
Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful
accounts. This would reduce our earnings and our cash flows.

Inventory valuation.

We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or
manufacture inventory. We periodically review these values to
ascertain that the inventory continues to maintain a market
value that is in excess of its recorded cost. Generally,
reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our
maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or
technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review
inventory quantities on hand and, where necessary, record
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our
estimated forecast of product demand and production requirement
or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not
materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to
increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This
would reduce our earnings and cash flows.

Value of long-lived assets, including
intangibles.

We carry a variety of
long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property and
equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of
these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market
values, and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We
undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets
such as goodwill and intangible assets and (2) on a
periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and
circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those
assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record
reduces our earnings. As reported in our 2002 financial
statements, the 2002 initial assessment of goodwill
recoverability under SFAS No. 142 resulted in a
$117.8 million charge to our earnings. The charge relating
to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our
Optoelectronics business segment was caused by expected declines
in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key
end-markets. While we believe that our future estimates are
reasonable, different assumptions regarding items



such as future cash flows and the volatility
inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations
and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of
those assets.

Employee compensation and
benefits.

We develop estimates of the
cost of the health care, pension and post-retirement benefits we
provide to employees based on factors including current discount
rates, trends in health care costs, projected returns on trust
assets and anticipated salary increases. The impact of pension
and post-retirement benefits have not had a material impact on
the results from operations or cash flows. Our anticipated rate
of return for our pension plans has been based, in general, on
the average rate of return on assets expected. The expected rate
of return on assets is based both on our actual long-term
historic return on assets and expected future rates of return
for the asset investment classes. The discount rates used to
measure our pension obligation reflect rates at which the
pension benefit could be settled. The discount rates chosen are
based on the current returns of investment quality bonds. In
light of declining interest rates and rates of asset returns, we
reduced our discount rate and expect to reduce our expected rate
of return on plan assets. The reduction in rates is not expected
to have a material impact on our financial results. Changes in
these assumptions could lead to changes in estimates of cost
and, consequently, to additional charges or credits to our
earnings. We have reduced the volatility in our health care
costs provided to our retirees because of the defined dollar
plan feature we adopted. Our future liability therefore, cannot
be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care.

Restructuring
activities.

Our financial statements
detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as
well as the actual spending that has occurred against the
resulting accruals. Our restructuring charges are estimates
based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance
benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit
formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon
certain facilities based on known lease costs and estimates of
sub-rental income and, (3) as discussed earlier, asset
impairments. Because these accruals are estimates, they are
subject to change as a result of deviations from initial
restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to
our attention. When such changes in estimates occur they are
reflected in our financial statements on the income statement
line entitled

restructuring charges, net

.

Gains or losses on
dispositions.

At the time we record
the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we
make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on
the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of
factors, including current interest in the market, alternative
markets for the assets and other relevant factors. If
anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount
of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated
proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the
asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected
contingencies when the transaction has been consummated.
Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first
estimated. Such changes decrease or increase current earnings
and are recorded either against the

gains on disposition

or

discontinued operations

line items appearing in
our income statement.

Income taxes.

Our
business operations are global in nature, and our tax structure
is complex. Tax rates in countries throughout the world vary
substantially and are, on occasion, subject to fluctuations
given the current political and economic climate in those
countries. We employ tax planning strategies so as to minimize
our overall tax burden. These strategies contemplate tax rates
being in effect in certain countries and we use these rates to
determine both our current and deferred tax status. Any
significant fluctuations in rates and tax laws could cause our
estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in
the future to change. Such changes could lead to either
increases or decreases in our effective tax rates.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risks

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us
to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts
receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of
credit risk as of December 29, 2002.



In the ordinary course of business, we enter into
foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our
committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency
movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter-company
and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are
primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that
do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until
maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated
balance sheet. Credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange
instruments are contracted with major banking institutions.
Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts
are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as
fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related
unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other
comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income
in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction
occurs. Effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured
utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed
quarterly. For the year ended December 29, 2002, net losses
from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to
sales and expense totaled $639,000. The notional amount of the
outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately
$103.0 million at December 29, 2002 and
$280.0 million as of December 30, 2001. At
December 29, 2002, the approximate fair value for foreign
currency derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges
was insignificant. At December 30, 2001, the approximate
fair value for foreign currency derivative instruments
designated as fair value hedges was $560,000.

Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are
exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and
currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to
these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions
pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted
market exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk.

As a multinational corporation, we are
exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. These exposures
can take a variety of different forms:



We use foreign currency forward and option
contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The
derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not
held for trading purposes. We specifically use forward contracts
to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use
a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge
anticipated cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to
offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets,
liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.
The success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of
transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent that
these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of
currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency
gains or losses. The principal currencies hedged are the British
Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore
Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid,
cost-effective forward market, we maintain hedge coverage
between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our
anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one
year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in
the value of the related exposure.

Foreign Currency Risk —
Value-at-Risk Disclosure

—
We utilize a Value-at Risk (“VaR”) model to determine
the potential earning/ fair value exposures presented by our
foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed
above, we seek to minimize such exposures through our hedging
program. Our VaR computation is based on the Monte Carlo
simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding
period of 30 days. As of December 29, 2002, this
computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market
value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding
derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to
foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.6 million.
This VaR measure is consistent with our financial statement
disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program.
Specifically, during the four quarters ended December 29,
2002, the VaR ranged between $0.6 million and
$1.6 million, and averaged approximately $1.1 million.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described earlier, our debt
portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate
instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a
direct impact on both our short-term cash flows (as they relate
to interest) and our earnings. For the year ended
December 29, 2002, we maintained, for a portion of our
fixed rate debt portfolio, an interest rate swap that served to
effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. This
interest rate swap was specifically designed to serve as both a
fair value hedge on our 6.8% $115 million debt and to
modify our cash flows so that our net interest payments would be
reduced in the event that interest rates continued to decline.
The swap was marked to market in our consolidated financial
statements so that fair value movements in the swap were offset
by the fair value movement in the debt. This swap position was
terminated at the end of 2002 when the 6.8% debt was effectively
retired.

Interest Rate Risk —
Sensitivity

— As we have
discussed above, we have restructured our debt in the fourth
quarter of 2002. Accordingly, as of December 29, 2002, 61%
of our debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and 39%
represented by variable rate debt. There are currently no
interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments outstanding
intended to hedge fair value, cash flow or earnings exposures.
Our current debt covenants also require that we maintain at
least 50% of our debt portfolio in fixed rate debt as defined in
the Credit Agreement. Our current earnings exposure can be
summarized as follows:

(1) changes in interest rates can cause our
    interest charges on $315 million in variable rate debt to
    fluctuate. A 10% increase or approximately 55 basis points in
    current interest rates would cause additional pre-tax charge to
    our earnings of $1.7 million for fiscal year 2003.

(2) changes in interest rates can cause our
    cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt
    to fluctuate. Just as described immediately above, an increase
    of 10% or approximately 55 basis points in current interest
    rates can cause our cash outflows to increase by
    $1.7 million for fiscal year 2003.

(3) changes in interest rates can cause the
    value of our fixed rate debt to change. However, such a value
    change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows
    unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open
    market.



Forward-Looking Information and Factors
Affecting Future Performance

This annual report on Form 10-K contains
“forward-looking statements” as defined in
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For
this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are
not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be
forward-looking statements. Words such as “believes,”
“anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,”
“will” and similar expressions are intended to
identify forward-looking statements. There are a number of
important factors that could cause our results to differ
materially from those indicated by these forward-looking
statements including, among others, the factors set forth
below.

The following important factors affect our
business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of
our business and operations:

Our operating results may continue to be
harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries
into which we sell our products.

Some of the industries and markets into which we
sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns often are
characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing
capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits.
Significant downturns in our customers’ markets and in
general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand
for several of our products and have hurt our operating results.
For example, during 2002, our operating results were adversely
affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve, including
the pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductor and aerospace
markets. Current economic conditions have caused a decrease in
capital spending by many of our customers, which in turn has
adversely affected our sales and business. These trends are
continuing in 2003.

If we do not introduce new products in a
timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our
operating results would suffer.

We sell many of our products in industries
characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new
product and service introductions and evolving industry
standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and
enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete
over time, in which case our sales and operating results would
suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend
upon several factors, including our ability to:

Many of our products are used by our customers to
develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must
anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of
the commercialization of our customers’ products. In
developing new products, we may be required to make significant
investments before we can determine the commercial viability of
the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our
customers’ needs and future activities, we may invests
heavily in research, and development of products that do not
lead to significant sales.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is
subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability
to develop or commercialize products for some applications. For
example, some of our license agreements are limited to the field
of life sciences research, and exclude clinical diagnostics
applications.

Our substantial debt may adversely affect our
cash flow and may restrict our investment
opportunities.

We have a substantial amount of outstanding
indebtedness. As of December 29, 2002, we had approximately
$805.5 million in outstanding indebtedness including
$186.5 million in outstanding zero coupon



debentures, excluding obligations under our
accounts receivable securitization facility. Also, we have
$100.0 million in borrowing capacity available to us under
our revolving credit facility.

Our substantial level of indebtedness increases
the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient
cash to pay the principal or interest in respect of our
indebtedness. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and
working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs,
which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

Our substantial leverage could have significant
negative consequences, including:

A significant portion of our indebtedness bears
interest at floating rates. As a result, our interest payment
obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates
increase.

Our ability to satisfy our obligations, and to
reduce our total debt depends on our future operating
performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other
factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate
sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to
successfully execute our business strategy. If we are unable to
service our debt and fund our business, we may be forced to
reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional financing
or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt or sell
assets. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or
refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us
or at all.

Restrictions in our senior credit facility and
the indenture governing our 8 7/8% notes may limit our
activities.

Our senior credit facility and the indenture
relating to our 8 7/8% notes contain, and future debt
instruments to which we may become subject may contain,
restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in
activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including
restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries
to:



•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or
    substantially all of our assets and the assets of our
    subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet specified financial
ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility. Our
ability to comply with these financial restrictions and
covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is
subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors,
including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign
exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and
changes in the level of competition.

Our failure to comply with any of these
restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default
under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit
acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to
prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an
acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would
trigger an event of default under our 8 7/8% notes, and a
default under our 8 7/8% notes would trigger an event of
default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt.

If an event of default occurs, we may not have
sufficient funds available to make the required payments under
our indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under
our senior credit facility, those lenders may be entitled to
foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings
under that agreement. Our inability to repay amounts owed under
our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other
of our obligations including our accounts receivable
securitization facility.

Economic, political and other risks associated
with foreign operations could adversely affect our international
sales.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our
businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States
represented 66% of our total sales in the fiscal year ended
December 29, 2002. We anticipate that sales from
international operations will continue to represent a
substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our
manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located
outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could
be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

Our quarterly operating results are subject to
significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our
operations to effectively address changes we do not
anticipate.

Given the nature of the markets in which we
participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and
profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic
conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we can
offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to
make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high
proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our
significant sales,



research and development and manufacturing costs.
Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect
our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our
quarterly operating results include:

We may not be able to successfully execute
acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired
businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business
or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies
profitable.

We have in the past, and may in the future,
supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and
licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing
product lines, such as our acquisition of Packard BioScience
Company in November 2001. We may be unable to identify or
complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many
reasons, including:

Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may
be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the
earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our
earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable
levels of profitability, we must improve their management,
operations, products and market penetration. We may not be
successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties
in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise
additional funds, either through public or private financings.
We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so
only on terms unacceptable to us.

If we do not successfully integrate our Life
Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, we may not
achieve the benefits we anticipate we will derive from the
combination of these businesses.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we announced the
combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments
business units into a new integrated business named Life and
Analytical Sciences, representing 66% of our total sales for
2002. This combination is subject to various integration risks,
and the integration of these two business units may not achieve
the benefits we anticipate it will achieve. As a result of the
combination, we may experience a loss of productivity, sales and
key personnel. In addition, the information technology systems
of the two businesses may not be fully compatible. If any of
these potential difficulties were to occur and persist, the
business results of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments
reporting segments could suffer.



We are targeting annualized cost savings from the
combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments
businesses of between $30.0 million and $45.0 million.
Because we anticipate that the benefits of the combination of
these businesses will not be fully realized until 2004, we are
targeting cost savings of between $12.0 million and
$25.0 million in 2003. While we believe these cost savings
to be reasonable, they are estimates that are inherently
difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature.
In addition, unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the
estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration.
As a result, our actual cost savings, if any, could differ or be
delayed, compared to our estimates.

Our loss of licenses may require us to stop
selling products or lose competitive advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses
or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to
us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other
proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products
incorporating that technology and possibly other products,
redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential
competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to
license and potentially erode our market share.

Our licenses typically subject us to various
economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply
with these obligations we could lose important rights under a
license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some
cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition,
rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out
of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent
protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the
licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that
curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business
will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous
competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to
compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain
competitive, we must develop new products and periodically
enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also
have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay
competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or
market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of
entire product lines.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance
with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug
Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced
to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution,
and we could be subject to civil or criminal
penalties.

Some of the products produced by our Life and
Analytical Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by
the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar
international agencies. In addition, some of the activities of
our Fluid Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by
the United States Federal Aviation Administration. These
regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from
design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion,
sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those
regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may
have to recall products and cease their manufacture and
distribution. In addition, we could be subject to fines or
criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce
demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our
customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign
regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food
and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our
products to meet customer needs created by these regulations.
Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand
for our products or increase our costs of producing these
products.

Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for
our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be
difficult and expensive; we may infringe intellectual property
rights of third parties.

Patent and trade secret protection is important
to us because developing and marketing new technologies and
products is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United
States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional
patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents
from any pending or



future patent applications owned by or licensed
to us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be
broad enough to protect our technology.

Third parties may seek to challenge,
invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to
us or claim that our products and operations infringe their
patent or other intellectual property rights.

In addition to our patents, we possess an array
of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and we license
intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The
measures that we employ to protect this technology and these
rights may not be adequate. Moreover, in some cases, the
licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a
non-exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified
performance targets.

We may incur significant expense in any legal
proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend
infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of
third parties against us could result in awards of substantial
damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from
manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the
United States or abroad.

Our results of operations will be adversely
affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible
assets.

As of December 29, 2002, our total assets
included $1.4 billion of net intangible assets. Net
intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated
with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent
rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of
accumulated amortization. These assets have historically been
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives. In connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 142, we
discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets beginning in fiscal 2002. Instead, we will
test these items, at a minimum, on an annual basis for potential
impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market
value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned.

During the second quarter of 2002, we completed
our transitional implementation of the impairment testing
provisions of SFAS No. 142, which resulted in a
$117.8 million before-and-after-tax charge for goodwill
associated with our lighting business. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142, we took this charge as the
effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal
2002.

Future impairment testing may result in
additional intangible asset write-offs, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

Financial Statements and Supplemental
    Data




INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
PerkinElmer, Inc.

Wellesley, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001, and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 29, 2002. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 29, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 to conform
to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Accounting
    Policies

Nature of
Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a
global high technology company which designs, manufactures,
markets and supports products, systems and service offerings
within four business segments: Life Sciences, Analytical
Instruments, Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences. In July 2001,
PerkinElmer, Inc. approved a plan to sell its Security and
Detection Systems business, which is presented as discontinued
operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 30,

Reporting the
Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions

(“APB No. 30”)(see Note 6).

In June 2002, the Company approved separate plans
to dispose of its Telecommunications Components and
Entertainment Lighting businesses. The Company has accounted for
these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

, (“SFAS No. 144”), which
the Company adopted as of the beginning of fiscal 2002.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
Company). All material intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Policies and
Estimates:

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its
estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Sales:

The majority
of the Company’s product sales are recorded at the point in
time of shipment, when title and risk of ownership passes to the
buyer and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. A provision is made at the
time the related revenue is recognized for the cost of any
installation obligations and the estimated cost of product
warranties. When other significant obligations remain after
products are delivered, including certain customer acceptance
provisions, revenue is recognized only after such obligations
are fulfilled. If a loss is anticipated on any contract, a
provision for the entire loss is made immediately. Revenue
related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period.
Shipping and handling costs are reflected in both revenue and
cost of goods sold to the extent they are billed to customers.
In all other instances they are reflected as a component of cost
of goods sold.

Inventories:

Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing
overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Substantially all inventories are accounted for using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of determining inventory
costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and
where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory
are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated
forecast of product demand and production requirements.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts:

The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of its customers to make required payments.

Income Taxes:

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the
recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss
carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits
is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance
is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization
is not more likely than not.

Property, Plant and
Equipment:

For financial statement
purposes, the Company depreciates plant and equipment using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which
generally fall within the following ranges:
buildings — 10 to 40 years; leasehold
improvements — estimated useful life or remaining term
of lease, whichever is shorter; machinery and
equipment — 3 to 7 years. Certain tooling costs
are capitalized and amortized over a 3 year life, while
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Pension Plans:

The
Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S.
pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not
fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds. A
minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the
actuarial present value of accumulated benefits exceeds plan
assets and accrued pension liabilities.

Translation of Foreign
Currencies:

For foreign operations
with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange
rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average
exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as
gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
component of stockholders’ equity.

Intangible Assets:

The Company’s intangible assets consist of
(1) goodwill, which is not being amortized commencing in
2002 and beyond; (2) indefinite lived intangibles, which
consist of certain patents and trademarks that are not subject
to amortization; and (3) amortizing intangibles, which
consist of patents, trademarks and purchased technologies, which
are being amortized over their useful lives. All intangible
assets are subject to impairment tests on a periodic basis.

Note 12 describes the impact of accounting for
the adoption of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets

, and the annual impairment methodology that the
Company will employ on January 1st of each year in calculating
the recoverability of goodwill. This same impairment test will
be performed at other times during the course of the year should
an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of
goodwill should be challenged. Non-amortizing intangibles are
also subject to annual impairment tests. However, the
methodology employed is as described in APB Opinion No. 17,

Intangible Assets.

Amortizing intangibles are currently
evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in SFAS
No. 144. Recoverability of these assets is assessed only
when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment.
When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted
undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset
relates are compared to the current carrying value of the
long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows
are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets,
including such intangibles, are written down to their respective
fair values.

Prior to 2002, the Company employed the
impairment methodologies set forth in SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.

These methodologies did
not differ substantially from SFAS No. 144 as they related
to amortizing intangibles. Goodwill was also previously
evaluated for impairment under SFAS No. 121 in 2001 and
2000.

Stock-Based
Compensation:

The Company issued
restricted stock to certain employees and has reflected the fair
value of these awards as unearned compensation until the
restrictions are released and the compensation is earned. As
allowed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, the Company has elected to account for
stock-based compensation at intrinsic value with disclosure of
the effects of fair value accounting on net income and earnings
per share on a pro forma basis. At December 29, 2002, the
Company has three stock-based compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Note 18. The Company accounts for
these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of
APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

, and related interpretations. No stock-based
employee compensation cost related to stock options is reflected
in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exercise price at least equal to the market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Investments and Marketable
Securities:

Investments where the
Company does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence are accounted for either in accordance with SFAS
No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities

or under the cost method. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
For public companies that have readily determinable fair values,
the Company classifies its equity investments as either
available-for-sale or trading. Should securities be classified
as available for sale, the Company records these investments at
their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in

accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)

. If
investments are classified as trading, any unrealized gain or
loss is recorded directly to the income statement. Under the
cost method of accounting, investments in private companies are
carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary
declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional
investments.

Investments in business entities in which the
Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies are
accounted for by the equity method. If the Company has
disproportionate capital at risk and the equity method investee
is recognizing losses, the Company records its proportionate
loss based on its proportionate capital at risk.

Cash Flows:

For
purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted instruments
with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value due to the short maturities.

Environmental
Matters:

The Company accrues for costs
associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been
discounted.

Comprehensive
Income:

Comprehensive income is
defined as net income and other changes in stockholders’
equity from transactions and other events from sources other
than stockholders. Comprehensive income is reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging:

The company records
derivative instruments on the balance sheet as assets or
liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting
from changes in the values of those



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

derivatives would be accounted for depending on
the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies
for hedge accounting. The effect of the adoption of SFAS
No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

, as of January 1, 2001 was not
material.

Stock Splits:

Per
share amounts and share data have been retroactively restated to
give effect to the two-for-one stock split on June 1, 2001,
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend for holders of
record as of May 15, 2001.

Reclassifications:

Certain financial statement amounts from prior years have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting
    Pronouncements

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

(“SFAS No. 146”), which nullifies
EITF Issue No. 94-3. SFAS No. 146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, whereas
EITF No. 94-3 had recognized the liability at the
commitment date to an exit plan. The Company is required to
adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 effective for exit or
disposal activities initiated after December 30, 2002.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of FASB Statement

No. 123 (“SFAS
No. 148”). SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS
No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of
Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. The disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 148 have been implemented in
Note 1 and Note 18 and the interim disclosure
requirements will be adopted by the Company in the first interim
period in 2003.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

. EITF
Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The
provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue
arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating, but has
not yet determined the effect that the adoption of EITF Issue
No. 00-21 will have on its results of operations and
financial condition.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51

. FIN 46 requires
certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the
primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the
entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for
the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46
is effective for all new variable interest entities created or
acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest
entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or
annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company is
currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 46
will have on its results of operations and financial condition.

Note 2:

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

In November 2001, the Company completed the
acquisition of 100% of Packard BioScience Company (Packard) for
a purchase price of approximately $764.0 million,
consisting primarily of approximately 22 million of the
Company’s common shares and the assumption of
$118.2 million in debt which was subsequently redeemed in
March 2002 (see Note 13). Packard is a global developer,
manufacturer and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

marketer of instruments and related consumables
and services for use in drug discovery and other life sciences
research, and generated sales of approximately
$165.0 million for its fiscal year ended December 31,
2000. The Company undertook this acquisition to extend its
capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation
and strengthened its position as a global provider of
comprehensive drug discovery solutions.

Packard’s operations, assumed as of the date
of acquisition, are reported within the results from operations
of the Life Sciences reporting segment. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS
No. 141, and the Company has accordingly allocated the
purchase price of Packard based upon the fair values of the net
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Portions of the net
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were valued by
independent appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures
and techniques. These intangible assets included
$69.0 million in acquired in-process research and
development for projects that had not yet reached technological
feasibility as of the acquisition date and for which no future
alternative use existed. These costs were expensed on the date
of the acquisition. Other acquired intangible assets valued at
$239.2 million included the fair value of trade names,
trademarks, patents and developed technology. Of this amount,
$76.5 million has been ascribed to trade names and
trademarks for which an indefinite life has been assigned. The
Packard acquisition also resulted in an allocation to goodwill
of $428.9 million. Indefinite lived intangibles and
goodwill are not being amortized in accordance with SFAS
No. 142, effective for all business combinations completed
subsequent to July 1, 2001.

In connection with this acquisition, the Company
agreed to issue 0.311 shares of PerkinElmer common stock
for each outstanding share of Packard common stock. The Company
also agreed to assume all outstanding options to purchase
Packard common stock, which became exercisable for shares of
PerkinElmer common stock following the merger, after giving
effect to the same exchange ratio provided for in the merger
agreement to the Packard common shareholders. The purchase price
for Packard has been allocated to the estimated fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Some allocations are
based on studies and independent valuations, as discussed above.

The components of the purchase price and
allocation are as follows (in thousands):

As part of the Packard acquisition and included
in liabilities assumed is approximately $17.1 million in
integration charges. The integration accrual was recorded
pursuant to a formal plan and includes initiatives to integrate
the operations of Packard and the Company and are principally
comprised of amounts related to employee separation costs and
the termination of leases and other contractual obligations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On July 31, 2000, the Company completed its
acquisition of 100% of NEN Life Sciences, Inc. (NEN), a provider
of state-of-the-art drug discovery products, services, reagents
and technologies to the life sciences industry for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $418.0 million. The
acquisition was undertaken to expand the Company’s drug
discovery products, services, reagents and technologies provided
to the life sciences industry. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company paid approximately $350.0 million
in cash and issued warrants to purchase approximately
600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, expiring
July 2003, at $40.00 per share in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares, options and warrants of NEN. In addition,
the Company repaid approximately $50.0 million of
outstanding indebtedness of NEN. The Company financed the
acquisition and repayment of the outstanding indebtedness with
$410 million of commercial paper borrowings with a
weighted-average interest rate of 7%. These short-term
borrowings were repaid in August 2000 with proceeds from the
issuance of long-term convertible debentures (see Note 13).
NEN’s operations, included in the consolidated results of
the Company from the date of acquisition, are reported in the
Life Sciences reporting segment. The acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase under APB Opinion No. 16,

included in the Company’s financial statements from the
date of acquisition.

The components of NEN’s purchase price and
allocation were as follows (in thousands):

The valuation of the existing technology and
in-process research and development was determined using the
income method. Revenue and expense projections as well as
technology assumptions were prepared through 2010. The value
assigned to in-process technology relates primarily to eight
projects associated with the Packard acquisition and seven
projects associated with the NEN acquisition, all in various
stages of completion, but yet to reach technological
feasibility. The efforts required to develop the in-process
technologies into commercially viable products principally
relate to the completion of all planning, designing,
prototyping, verification and testing activities that are
necessary to establish that the products can be designed to meet
their design specifications, including function, features and
technical performance requirements. The



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

valuation of the in-process research and
development was determined separately from all other acquired
assets using the percentage-of-completion method.

As part of the July 2000 acquisition of NEN, the
Company recorded a $4.0 million integration charge for
actions targeted at reduced employment costs, consolidation of
certain facilities and the termination of certain leases and
other contractual obligations.

During the second quarter of 2000, the Company
finalized its integration plan in connection with its
acquisition of the Analytical Instruments Division of PE Corp.
Based on continued aggressive actions by the Company to improve
the cost structure of the acquired business, and increased costs
related primarily to employment integration, the Company
increased its original estimate of integration costs and related
goodwill recorded at the acquisition date by $24.0 million
in connection with purchase accounting.

The following table summarizes integration
reserve activity during 2002, 2001 and 2000 related to the
acquisitions of Analytical Instruments, NEN and Packard
acquisitions as discussed above:

Unaudited pro forma operating results for the
Company, assuming the acquisition of NEN and Packard occurred on
January 3, 2000 are noted in the following table. These
amounts do not give effect to businesses divested.

The pro forma amounts in the previous table
exclude the in-process research and development charges of
$69.0 million and $24.3 million for the Packard and
NEN acquisitions, respectively. The unaudited pro forma
financial information is provided for informational purposes
only and is not necessarily indicative of the Company’s
operating results that would have occurred had the acquisitions
been consummated on the dates for which the consummation of the
acquisitions are being given effect, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the Company’s future operating results. The
pro forma amounts do not reflect any operating efficiencies and
cost savings that the Company believes are achievable.

In March 2001, the Company purchased Applied
Surface Technology (AST) for $11.4 million in cash and the
Company’s common stock with an aggregate value of
$5.0 million. This acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase under APB Opinion No. 16 and the Company allocated
the purchase price of AST based on fair



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value of the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed. Portions of the purchase price, including intangible
assets, were valued by independent appraisers utilizing
generally accepted valuation techniques. These intangible assets
included $2.5 million for acquired in-process research and
development for projects that had not yet reached technical
feasibility and did not have future alternative uses.
Accordingly, these costs were expensed in the first quarter of
2001. The results of operations of AST are included in the
consolidated results of the Company from the date of the
acquisition. Pro forma accounts for the AST acquisition are not
material to the consolidated financial statements.

Divestitures

Gains on dispositions in 2002 included
$4.4 million from the sales of facilities and approximately
$0.8 million from the resolution of certain contingencies
related to the sale of the Instruments for Research and Applied
Sciences (IRAS) business.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
sold its IRAS business for cash of $55.5 million, resulting
in a pre-tax gain of approximately $32.3 million.
Additionally, at December 29, 2002 the Company has deferred
a gain of approximately $0.5 million in connection with
certain contingencies related to the sale. Also during the
fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold its Voltarc business
for cash of $9.5 million and a note for approximately
$8.0 million, resulting in a pre-tax loss of approximately
$6.3 million. The combined net income of the disposed
businesses were $5.4 million in 2000 and $1.4 million
in 2001 through the date of disposal.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
sold its Berthold business at a net pre-tax gain of
$10 million. The Company deferred gain recognition of
approximately $11.9 million of sales proceeds from this
divestiture in connection with certain contingencies related to
the sale, $2.0 million of which was recognized during 2001
as a result of the resolution of certain events and
contingencies. Revenues for 2000 for the divested business was
approximately $30.0 million.

Also during 2000, the Company recorded a pre-tax
gain of $16.7 million from the sale of a building, and
recognized $2.4 million in net losses related to certain
other asset dispositions.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company
sold its micromachined sensors and specialty semiconductor
businesses for cash of $24.3 million, resulting in a
pre-tax gain of $6.7 million. Combined financial results of
the divested businesses for 2000 were not material to the
consolidated results of the Company.

All of the gains described above are reported on
the “Gains on dispositions, net” line in the
consolidated income statements.

Note
3:     Restructuring Charges


In connection with the Company’s decision to
combine the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses,
the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
$26.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002. The
restructuring charge consists of approximately
$20.8 million of severance payments, $3.5 million in
lease cancellation payments and $1.7 million of asset
writedowns.

During the first quarter of 2002, consistent with
the strategic direction of the Company and concurrent with the
reevaluation of existing restructuring plans at the time, the
Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of
$9.2 million. The principal actions related to a workforce
reduction and overhead reductions resulting from continued
reorganization activities, including the closure of certain
manufacturing facilities. The restructuring charge consisted of
$7.7 million of severance charges and $0.3 million of
lease cancellation payments and $1.2 million of asset
writedowns.

Consistent with the strategic direction of the
Company and concurrent with the reevaluation of existing
restructuring plans at the time, the Company recorded a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $9.2 million during the fourth
quarter of 2001. The principal actions within the charge related
to a workforce reduction and overhead reductions resulting from
continued reorganization activities, including the closure of
certain manufacturing facilities. The restructuring charge
consisted of $7.0 million of severance charges,
$2.1 million for lease and other contractual obligation
cancellations, and $0.1 million for the disposal of certain
product lines and assets. A large portion of these actions were
attributable to the consolidation of certain European general
and administrative functions within both the Life Sciences and
Analytical Instruments reporting segments.

The Company recorded restructuring charges by
segment for 2001 are as follows:


During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $15.1 million.
These charges related to the Company’s Life Sciences and
Optoelectronics reporting segments. The principal actions in the
restructuring plans included close-down or consolidation of a
number of offices and facilities, the closure of certain
manufacturing facilities, and the disposal of underutilized
assets. The restructuring charges included: Life Sciences’
actions associated with the integration of administrative
functions and overall facility consolidation, and
Optoelectronics’ actions associated with its Lighting and
Imaging businesses related to employee separation costs and the
closures of certain manufacturing facilities.

The Company recorded restructuring charges by
segment for 2000 are as follows:

2001 were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 29, 2002, the Company had net
operating loss carryovers of approximately $57.1 million,
R&E credits totaling $4.2 million and foreign tax
credits of $3.7 million, subject to various carryforward
periods. Based on the judgment of the Company, the valuation
allowance takes into consideration limitations imposed upon the
use of the tax attribute carryovers and reduces the value of
such items to the likely net realizable amount.

Current deferred tax assets of $103 million
and $83 million were included in other current assets at
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively.
Long-term deferred tax liabilities of $112 million and
$111 million were included in long-term liabilities at
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively.

With the exception of deferred taxes that were
specifically provided on earnings that were anticipated to be
repatriated and dividends actually paid to the U.S., the Company
does not provide for taxes on unremitted earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries. It is the practice and intention of the Company to
permanently reinvest the income of its foreign subsidiaries in
its overseas operations. However, certain requirements of the
senior secured credit facility discussed in Note 13 may
require the Company to repatriate earnings of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries in the future. Consistent with past practice the
Company will include in its income tax provision the incremental
tax cost, if any, for earnings to be repatriated to the U.S. to
satisfy debt and other obligations when such events become
foreseeable.

Note
6:     Discontinued
Operations

In June 2002, the Company completed the sale of
its Security and Detection Systems business for cash
consideration of approximately $100.0 million and a net
working capital adjustment, the amount of which has yet to be
finalized. A net pre-tax gain of approximately
$15.0 million was recorded pursuant to this transaction in
2002 as a gain on the disposition of a discontinued operation.
The Company has accounted for its Security and Detection Systems
business as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB
No. 30, and accordingly, the results of operations and
related cash flows of this business through the disposal date
have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as
a separate line on the Company’s Consolidated Income
Statements. The assets and liabilities of the Security and
Detection Systems business are reflected within the assets and
liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods prior to its sale,
and the resulting gain from the sale is presented as a component
of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations,
net of income tax on the Company’s 2002 Consolidated Income
Statement.

During June 2002, the Company approved separate
plans to shut down its Telecommunications Component and sell its
Entertainment Lighting businesses as part of its continued
efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. The results of
these businesses were previously reported as part of the
Optoelectronics reporting segment. The Company has accounted for
these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, and accordingly, has presented the results of
operations and related cash flows of these businesses as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
and liabilities of these disposal groups have been presented
separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities
from discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with these actions, the Company
recorded the following gains and losses, which have been
reported as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations
during the year ended December 29, 2002:

Amounts recorded as gain on dispositions of
discontinued operations for the years ended December 30,
2001 and December 30, 2000, totaling $2,367 and $4,453,
respectively, are attributable to the 1999 sale of the Technical
Services business. The amounts recognized as gains reflect the
resolution of contingencies recorded on certain long-term
contracts and transitional services provided to the Technical
Services business subsequent to the sale.

Summary operating results of the discontinued
operations of the Telecommunications Component and Entertainment
Lighting businesses through December 29, 2002 and the
Security and Detection Systems business through June 30,
2002, the date of divestiture, were as follows:

Note 7:     Earnings
per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing
net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share was
computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive
common shares outstanding, primarily shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. The
following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the
earnings per share calculations:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Shares of common stock related to employee stock
options to purchase 15.5 million, 8.0 million and
0.1 million shares of common stock were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share for 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively, because their effect would have been
antidilutive. Additionally, warrants to purchase
0.6 million shares of common stock were not included in the
computation of diluted earning per share in 2002 and 2001
because their effect would have been antidilutive. Conversion of
the Company’s zero coupon debentures was not assumed in the
computation of diluted earnings per share for the years
presented because the effect of assumed conversion would have
been antidilutive for all periods presented.

Note 8:     Accounts
Receivable

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for
doubtful accounts of $21.4 million and $13.0 million as of
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively.

During 2001, the Company established a wholly
owned consolidated subsidiary to fund, on a revolving basis,
certain of the Company’s accounts receivable balances and
simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of
receivables to a financial institution. As collections reduce
the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are
sold. The Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the
risk of credit loss on the receivables and accordingly, the full
amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided
for on the Company’s balance sheet. Under the terms of this
arrangement, the Company retains collection and administrative
responsibilities for the balances. The accounts receivable
securitization facility provides for up to $51.0 million in
accounts receivable funding. The facility has an effective
interest rate at December 29, 2002 of approximately LIBOR
plus 140 basis points. Amounts funded under this facility were
$29.0 million and $37.0 million at December 29,
2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively. This amount has
reduced the outstanding receivable balance. The facility
includes conditions that require the Company to maintain a
corporate credit rating of BB or above as defined by Standard
& Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above as defined
by Moody’s Investors Service. At December 29, 2002 the
Company had a senior unsecured credit rating of BB+ with a
stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating
Services and of Ba2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s
Investors Service. In January 2003, the Company entered into an
agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable
securitization facility to January 31, 2004.

Note 12:     Goodwill
and Intangible Assets

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142. SFAS
No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after
July 1, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed
annually at a minimum for potential impairment by comparing the
carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which
they are assigned. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 are
effective for the Company’s current fiscal year.
Accordingly, the Company has ceased goodwill amortization as of
the beginning of fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level
upon initial adoption and at least annually thereafter,
utilizing a two-step methodology. The initial step requires the
Company to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and
compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill of such
unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no
impairment loss would be recognized. However, if the carrying
value of the reporting unit exceeds the corresponding fair
value, the goodwill of this unit may be impaired. The amount, if
any, of the impairment would then be evaluated with the goodwill
balance being adjusted to approximate fair value.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with adopting this standard, the
Company, assisted by independent valuation consultants, has
completed the transitional testing of goodwill using a
measurement date of January 1, 2002. The results of this
testing indicated that the carrying values of the lighting
reporting unit within the Optoelectronics business unit exceeded
the estimated fair value of this unit as determined utilizing
various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and
comparative market analysis. This is attributable to decreases
in forecasted results versus those previously contemplated.
Accordingly, an impairment charge has been recognized as a
change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The
impairment charge was $117.8 million on a before and
after-tax basis.

The adjustment to previously reported
(loss) income from continuing operations before effect of
accounting change and (loss) earnings per share before effect of
accounting change below illustrates the impact of goodwill
amortization on reported results. The impact on net
(loss) income, and basic and diluted net
(loss) earnings per share for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as

13:     Debt

Senior Secured Credit
Facility.

In December 2002, the
Company entered into a new senior credit facility with a group
of commercial banks. This facility is comprised of a six-year
term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a
$100.0 million revolving credit facility that is available
through December 2007. This credit facility is secured primarily
by substantially all domestic assets.

The interest rates under the senior credit
facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit
facility are determined as a spread over either the Eurodollar
rate or the base rate as defined in the credit agreement. The
applicable margin for the term loan is 400 basis points for
the Eurodollar rate and 300 basis points for the base rate.
The Company may allocate all or a portion of the outstanding
indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based
upon the spread over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At
December 29, 2002, the Eurodollar rate was approximately
140 basis points and the base rate was 425 basis
points. The term loan will be repayable in nominal quarterly
installments until December 2007, and thereafter in four equal
quarterly installments until December 2008. The revolving credit
facility is available through December 2007 for working capital
needs. At December 29, 2002, we had no outstanding
principal balance under the revolving credit facility.

The senior credit facility contains covenants
requiring specific financial ratios, including:

8 7/8% Notes

.
In December 2002, the Company issued and sold ten-year senior
subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of
$300.0 million. The Company received $297.5 million in
gross proceeds from the issuance. Deferred issuance costs of
$7.0 million were recorded as a non-current asset. The
debt, which matures in January 2013, is unsecured, but is
guaranteed by substantially all domestic assets. Interest on the
8 7/8% notes is payable semi-annually on January 15
and July 15, beginning July 15, 2003. If a change of
control occurs, each holder of 8 7/8% notes may require the
Company to repurchase some or all of the notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus
accrued interest. Before January 15, 2006, the Company may
redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of our
8 7/8% notes with the net proceeds of specified public
equity offerings at 108.875% of the principal amount of the
notes, plus accrued interest, if at least 65% of the aggregate
principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the
redemption. The Company may redeem some or all of the
8 7/8% notes at any time on or after January 15, 2008,
at a redemption price of 104.438%. The redemption price
decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009, to 101.479% on
January 15, 2010 and to 100% on January 15, 2011. The
debt is subordinated to the senior credit facility and other
existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness, all of
which is discussed below.

The 8 7/8% notes contain financial and other
covenants. Most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain
an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services and Moody’s Investors Service.

Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures.

In August 2000, the Company sold zero
coupon convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price
of $460.0 million. The zero coupon convertible debentures
were then due August 2020 and were priced with a yield to
maturity of 3.5%. The zero coupon debentures include a call
provision which allow the Company to call the debentures as
early as August 2003. During 2002, $106.5 million of the
zero coupon convertible debentures were purchased in open market
transactions, resulting in a gain of approximately
$8.4 million. In December 2002, the Company completed a
tender offer to purchase any and all of the existing zero coupon
convertible debentures. As of December 29, 2002,
$205.6 million of the issue was tendered and redeemed. The
remaining $186.5 million will either be repurchased prior
to the first available call date of August 2003 or called at
that time. Under the terms of the senior secured credit
facility, the Company is required to redeem all of the zero
coupon debentures remaining



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

outstanding at that time. An amount equal to the
accreted value of the outstanding debentures, totaling
$186.5 million, was placed in escrow as of
December 29, 2002. Accordingly, the zero coupon debentures
have been reported as a current liability in the consolidated
balance sheet.

6.8% Notes.

In
October 1995 the Company issued $115.0 million in notes
bearing an interest rate of 6.8% and maturing in 2005. During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the fixed rate on these notes was
swapped to a floating rate using a swap instrument which reset
semi-annually in arrears based upon six-month USD LIBOR. In
December 2002, the Company completed a tender offer for
outstanding 6.8% notes. As of December 29, 2002 all but
$4.7 million of these notes had been tendered. In
connection with this tender offer, the swap arrangement was
terminated and a gain of $4.4 million was recorded.

Packard Notes.

In
November 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of Packard
and assumed $118.2 million of senior subordinated ten-year
notes issued in March 1997. The notes were redeemed on
March 1, 2002 at a rate of 104.688% in accordance with the
indenture dated as of March 4, 1997. As such, this amount
was reclassified to short-term on our December 30, 2001
balance sheet for presentation purposes. In connection with this
redemption, a loss of $5.5 million was recognized as a
result of the call premium paid to the holders of the notes.

charged to continuing operations was $7.3 million in 2002
and $6.5 million in 2001 and $5.1 million in 2000.

Pension Plans:

The
Company has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially
all U.S. employees except those employed by Life Sciences
and non-U.S. pension plans for non-U.S. employees. The
U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new hires
effective January 31, 2001. The plans provide benefits that
are based on an employee’s years of service and
compensation near retirement. Assets of the U.S. plan are
comprised primarily of equity and debt securities.

Net periodic pension cost included the following
components:

The following table sets forth the changes in the
funded status of the principal U.S. pension plan and the
principal non-U.S. pension plans and the amounts recognized in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also sponsors a supplemental
executive retirement plan to provide senior management with
benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective
July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, the projected
benefit obligations were $16.6 million and
$16.5 million, respectively. Assets with a fair value of
$5.4 million and $8.0 million segregated in a trust,
were available to meet this obligation as of December 29,
2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively. Pension expense
for this plan was approximately $1.6 million in 2002 and
$1.1 million in 2001.

An additional minimum liability of
$3.9 million was recorded to Stockholder’s Equity
during 2002 as a result of the fair value of the plan assets for
the Company’s pension plan in the United Kingdom being
below the accumulated benefit obligation of the same plan. To
the extent the fair value of the plan assets of the
Company’s U.S. pension plan fell below the associated
accumulated benefit obligation, the Company will have to
reclassify the amount of prepaid pension to Stockholder’s
Equity. Unrecognized net losses are amortized over the remaining
service period in accordance with accounting regulations.

Postretirement Medical Plans:

The Company provides health care
benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a
comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance
organizations where available. The majority of the
Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree
health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and
have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical
plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a
deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other
group coverages and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree
contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for
cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan
was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the
Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on
employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount
allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined
benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are comprised primarily
of equity and debt securities.

Net periodic post-retirement medical benefit cost
(credit) included the following components:

The following table sets forth the changes in the
postretirement medical plan’s funded status and the amounts
recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

*

In 2001, the Company moved entirely to a defined
    dollar plan. Accordingly, such assumptions are no longer
    applicable.

The accrued postretirement medical liability
included $3.0 million and $4.5 million classified as
long-term liabilities as of December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

During 1998, the Company implemented
certain nonqualified deferred compensation programs that provide
benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their
designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon
retirement or death. Benefit payments under these plans are
funded by a combination of contributions from participants and
the Company. The Company has not made any cash contributions to
this plan since inception. The obligations related to the
deferred compensation plan totaled $6.8 million and
$9.9 million at December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001, respectively.

Note
16:     Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters
that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities.
Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and
it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved
unfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals
for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable.
Management believes that any liability that may ultimately
result from the resolution of these matters in excess of amounts
provided will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the
Company.

The Company and certain officers have been named
as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs
have alleged various statements made by the Company and
management were misleading with respect to the Company’s
prospects and future operating results. The Company believes it
has meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and intends to contest
the actions vigorously. The Company is currently unable,
however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, if any,
that may result from resolution of these matters.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition, the Company is conducting a number
of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current
and former Company locations and, along with other companies,
has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain
waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental
issues in the accounting period that the Company’s
responsibility is established and when the cost can be
reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $7.1 million
as of December 29, 2002, representing management’s
estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known
environmental matters. Such amount is not discounted and does
not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or
indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject
to a number of variables, including the stage of the
environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible
contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible
joint and several liability, the timeframe over which
remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws
and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a
PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional
liability to result from the inability of other significant
named parties to contribute. The Company expects that such
accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten
years. As assessments and remediation activities progress at
each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and
adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes
available. There have been no environmental problems to date
that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
While it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding
the amounts recorded may have been incurred, the potential
exposure is not expected to be materially different than the
amounts recorded.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo
Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (“Enzo”)
filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448,
against Amersham PLC, Amersham Biosciences, PerkinElmer, Inc.,
PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,
Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid
Biosciences, Inc. The six count complaint alleges that the
Company breached our distributorship agreement with Enzo,
infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and
fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things,
engaging in commercial development and exploitation of
Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and
together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and
monetary relief. Management believes that we have meritorious
defenses to Enzo’s complaint and intend to contest the
claims vigorously. Management is currently unable, however, to
determine whether resolution of these matters will have a
material adverse impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

Note 17:     Warranty
Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for
certain products for periods ranging from one to three years
beyond the date of sale. The majority of costs associated with
warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the
time of service personnel to respond to repair and replacement
requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical
results, supplemented by management’s expectations of
future costs. A summary of warranty reserve activity for the
year ended December 29, 2002 is as follows:

Note
18:     Stockholders’
Equity

Stock-Based Compensation.

As of December 29, 2002, the
Company had three stock-based compensation plans. Under the 2001
Incentive Plan, 8.8 million shares of the Company’s
common stock were made



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

available for option grants, restricted stock
awards, performance units and other stock-based awards. Under
the Life Sciences Plan, 2.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock were made available for option
grants. The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
whereby participating employees have the right to purchase
common stock at a discount.

The following table summarizes stock option
activity for the three years ended December 29, 2002:

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding at December 29, 2002:

The weighted-average fair value of options
granted during 2002, 2001, and 1999 were $12.06, $14.40 and
$9.91, respectively. The values were estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
following weighted-average assumptions were used in the model:

In April 1999, the Company’s stockholders
approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, whereby
participating employees currently have the right to purchase
common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing
price on the first day or the last day of the six-month offering
period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase,
subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the
employee’s



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

voluntary contribution, which may not exceed 10%
of base compensation. During 2002, the Company issued 739,302
shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of
$8.39 per share. During 2001, the Company issued 449,082
shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $23.40 per
share. During 2000, the Company issued 420,534 shares under
this plan at a weighted-average price of $21.82 per share. There
remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of
2.7 million shares of the Company’s stock out of
5 million shares authorized by shareholders.

Other:

The Company
has awarded restricted stock to certain executive employees and
directors that contain vesting provisions and performance
targets. These shares were awarded under the Company’s 1999
Incentive Plan. The compensation expense associated with the
fair value of these awards is recognized over the period that
the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The
unearned portion of the awards is reflected in
stockholders’ equity as unearned compensation until the
restrictions are released and the compensation is earned. During
the three years ended December 29, 2002, the Company
awarded 190,000 shares in 2002, 15,000 shares in 2001
and 385,000 shares in 2000, with weighted-average fair
values of $23.45 per share in 2002, $28.13 per share in 2001 and
$42.09 per share in 2000. The total compensation recognized
related to these restricted shares was approximately
$2.6 million in 2002, $3.5 million in 2001 and
$4.1 million in 2000. As of December 29, 2002, there
were 470,000 shares outstanding subject to forfeiture.

Comprehensive Income:

The components of accumulated other
comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax were as follows:

The tax effects related to each component of
other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note
19:     Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. The
Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit
risk as of December 29, 2002.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent
with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign
currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include
intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The
contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies,
generally have maturities that do not exceed 12 months,
have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at
fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and
market risk are not significant as the foreign exchange
instruments are contracted with major banking institutions.
Gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency
contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges
designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash
flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a
component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet. These deferred gains and losses are
recognized in income in the period in which the underlying
anticipated transaction occurs. Effectiveness of these cash flow
hedges is measured utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method
and is reviewed quarterly. For the year ended December 29,
2002, net losses from hedges reclassified from other
comprehensive income to revenue and expense totaled
$0.6 million. The notional amount of the outstanding
foreign currency contracts was approximately $103.0 million
as of December 29, 2002 and $280.0 million at
December 30, 2001. At December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001, the approximate fair value for foreign
currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges
was $0 and $0.6 million, respectively. The approximate fair
value for foreign currency derivative instruments designated as
cash flow hedges was $0 and $0.4 million at
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively.
At January 1, 2001, the fair value of all derivative
instruments was not significant. Accordingly, when the Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133, there was no
cumulative effect adjustment recorded.

During 2002, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement with a financial institution. This swap
agreement was designated as a fair value hedge related to the
6.8% notes due 2005. The swap converted fixed rate debt to
variable rate and was considered effective during the holding
period. When the 6.8% notes



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

were extinguished in December 2002, the swap was
also terminated, resulting in a net gain of $4.4 million,
which is included in other expense, net.

Note
20:     Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment
under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing
operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000 amounted to
$23.5 million, $20.5 million, and $17.6 million,
respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable
operating leases are as follows: $23.8 million in 2003,
$21.0 million in 2004, $18.5 million in 2005,
$12.8 million in 2006, $11.5 million in 2007 and
$170.1 million after 2007.

Prior to December 29, 2002, the Company was
party to a six-year operating lease agreement signed in 2000 for
its Fremont, CA facility within its Optoelectronics business
unit. As part of the Company’s 2002 Debt Refinancing, the
Company terminated this lease arrangement by paying the
$30.0 million obligation remaining on the facility.
Accordingly, the facility is now reflected in the Company’s
fixed asset balance.

Note 21:     Industry
Segment and Geographic Area Information

The Company’s businesses are reported as
four reportable segments which reflect the Company’s
management and structure under three strategic business units
(“SBUs”). The accounting policies of the reportable

Non-Shareholder Approved Plans

Life Sciences Incentive Plan and 1999 Vivid
Technologies Equity Incentive Plan

The Life Sciences Incentive Plan (“Life
Sciences Plan”) was assumed when the Company acquired
Packard BioScience Company. The Life Sciences Plan and the 2001
Plan, approved by our shareholders, are the only two plans from
which the Company is still making grants. The 1999 Vivid
Technologies Equity Incentive Plan (“Vivid Plan”) was
assumed when the Company acquired Vivid Technologies, Inc.; the
Company is not making future grants from this plan.

Shares subject to Plans:

A maximum of 2,322,606 shares in the
Life Sciences Plan, as adjusted, were approved by the
shareholders of the Packard BioScience Company for awards under
the Plan. A maximum of 600,000 shares in the Vivid Plan,
were approved by the shareholders of Vivid Technologies, Inc.
for awards under the Vivid Plan. Appropriate adjustments will be
made to the shares subject to these Plans and to outstanding
awards upon a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split,
recapitalization, combination, reclassification or similar
change in the capital structure of the Company. To the extent
that any outstanding option under the Life Sciences Plan expires
or terminates prior to exercise in full or if shares issued upon
exercise of an option or pursuant to a stock issuance are
repurchased by the Company, the shares of common



stock for which such option is not exercised, or
the repurchased shares are returned to the Life Sciences Plan
and become available for future grant.

Eligibility:

The
Company’s employees (excluding officers and directors) and
any individuals who have accepted an offer for employment are
eligible to be granted options or awards under the Plans.

Administration:

The
Life Sciences Plan and the Vivid Plan are administered by the
Board of Directors. The Board has the authority to grant options
and awards and to adopt, amend and repeal administrative rules,
guidelines and practices. The Board also may delegate the power
to make awards to one or more executive officers of the Company,
provided that the Board fixes the maximum number of shares
subject to awards and the maximum number of shares for any one
participant to be made by such executive officers. The Board may
delegate any or all of its powers under the Life Sciences Plan
or the Vivid Plan to one or more committees of the Board.

Terms and conditions:

The Board may grant options to
purchase common stock and determine the number of shares to be
covered by each option, the exercise price, and the conditions
and limitations applicable to the exercise of each option. The
exercise price at the time of option grant may not be less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time
the option is granted. The option term cannot exceed
10 years. The Board also may grant awards based upon the
common stock, including awards of restricted stock and stock
appreciation rights as well as performance awards.

Adjustments for Changes in Common Stock and
Certain Other
Events:

In
the event of a proposed liquidation or dissolution of the
Company, the Board will provide that all then unexercised
options will become exercisable in full and terminate effective
upon such liquidation or dissolution, except to the extent
exercised before such effective date. The Board may specify the
effect of a liquidation or dissolution on any award granted
under the Plan. In the event of an acquisition, defined as any
merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another
entity as a result of which the Common Stock is converted into
or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other
property or any exchange of shares of the Company for cash,
securities or other property pursuant to a statutory share
exchange transaction, the Board will provide that all
outstanding options will be assumed, or equivalent options shall
be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation. If
the acquiring or succeeding corporation does not agree to
assume, or substitute for the options, the Board will provide
that unexercised options will become exercisable in full as of a
specified time prior to the event.

Amendment:

The Board
may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Plans.

Other Plans

The Company has granted options to the
Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in January
1999 under a plan that was not approved by shareholders.

Shares subject to the plan:

A maximum of 900,000 shares in the
plan were approved for awards under the plan. Appropriate
adjustments will be made to the shares subject to options
outstanding under the plan upon a stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination,
reclassification, or similar change in the capital structure of
the Company. The options granted to our Chief Executive Officer
were the sole awards authorized for grant under the plan. No
additional grants may be made under the plan.

Administration:

The
plan is administered by the Board of Directors. The Board has
the authority to adopt, amend and repeal administrative rules,
guidelines and practices. The Board may delegate any or all of
its powers under the Plans to one or more committees of the
Board.

Terms and conditions:

Two option grants totaling 900,000
shares were made to the Chief Executive Officer. The first grant
was made on January 8, 1998, for 400,000 shares with a
per share exercise price of $10.59 and an expiration date in
January 2008. The option vested in full in January 2001.
The second grant was made on January 20, 1999, for 500,000
shares with a per share exercise price of $13.63 and an
expiration date in January 2009. The option vested in full in
January 2000. Vesting of the second option accelerated based on
satisfaction of the performance target of 50% cumulative growth
in earnings per share within two (2) years or less over the
base year 1998, adjusted for the effects of acquisitions and
divestitures. In each case,



the option exercise price represented the fair
market price of the stock on the date of grant. Upon the death
or total disability of the optionee, the optionee or his estate
has one year to exercise vested options. Upon retirement at a
Company-recognized retirement age the optionee has the earlier
of three (3) years or January 2009 to exercise vested
options. Upon termination of the optionee’s employment, all
further vesting stops and all unvested shares are cancelled.
Upon a change in control of PerkinElmer, all unvested options
become 100% vested.
