    Sciences.

We are a leading provider of
    drug discovery, genetic screening, and environmental and
    chemical analysis tools, including instruments, reagents,
    consumables and services.

•

Optoelectronics.

We
    provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty
    lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products
    and other specialty end markets.

•

We
    provide critical fluid control and containment systems for
    highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and
    semiconductor fabrication facilities.

In fiscal 2003, we had $1,535.2 million in
sales from continuing operations.

We are a Massachusetts corporation, founded in
1947. Our headquarters are in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and we
market our products, services and systems in more than 125
countries. As of December 28, 2003, we had approximately
10,000 employees. Our common stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange (trading symbol: PKI), and we are a
component of the S&P 500 Index.

We maintain a website with the address

http://www.perkinelmer.com/

. We are not including the
information contained in our website as part of, or
incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on
Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our
website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and
amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable
after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise
furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Significant Developments

As part of our efforts to refocus on our core
businesses, we have taken the following significant measures in
recent years.

Life and Analytical
Sciences.

In October 2002, we formed
our Life and Analytical Sciences business by combining our Life
Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses. We combined our
Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses to improve
our operational scale, which we believe will enable us to better
serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths
of the businesses’ sales, service and research and
development organization. In the second quarter of 2003, we
completed many of the changes involved in combining the two
businesses, including the integration of facilities, management
reporting and other systems. We achieved in excess of the
original range of $12 to $25 million in pre-tax cost
savings in fiscal 2003 from the combination of our Life Sciences
and Analytical Instruments businesses relative to our fiscal
2002 cost levels. We are targeting additional pre-tax cost
savings, from the combination, of between $5.0 million and
$20.0 million in fiscal 2004 for a combined pre-tax cost
savings of between $30.0 million and $45.0 million
relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels. Unforeseen factors may
offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other
benefits from the integration. As a result, our actual cost
savings, if any, could differ or be delayed, compared to our
estimates.

Security and Detection Systems
Business.

In June 2002, we completed
the sale of our Security and Detection Systems business to L-3
Communications. We received cash proceeds in this transaction of
approximately $100.0 million. These proceeds are subject to
a working capital adjustment, which we do not expect to be
material. We have reflected this business as a discontinued
operation for all periods presented in this annual report on
Form 10-K.



Telecommunications Components and
Entertainment Lighting Businesses.

In
June 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down
our Telecommunications Components business, and a plan to sell
our Entertainment Lighting business, as part of our continued
efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We reflected
these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods
presented in this annual report on Form 10-K.

In June 2003, we completed the sale of a
substantial portion of our Entertainment Lighting business for
cash consideration of $1.4 million and abandoned the
remaining assets. We recorded a net loss of $1.7 million
pursuant to this transaction in the second quarter of 2003 as a
loss on the disposition of discontinued operations.

Packard BioScience.

In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard
BioScience Company for consideration of approximately
$764.0 million, primarily from the issuance of
approximately 22 million shares of our common stock and our
assumption of $118.2 million in debt. The acquisition
extended our capabilities, now within our Life and Analytical
Sciences business unit, in liquid handling, high throughput
screening and proteomics, and strengthened our position as a
global provider of comprehensive drug discovery solutions.

Life and Analytical Sciences

Our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit is
a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening and
environmental and chemical analysis tools, including
instruments, reagents, consumables and services. Our instruments
are used in daily applications for scientific research and
clinical applications. Our research products provide the
fundamental tools necessary for a variety of testing
applications that are critical to the development of many of our
customers’ new products.

Our Life and Analytical Sciences business helps
our customers solve complex analytical problems encountered in
drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical
analysis laboratories. In fiscal 2003, our Life and Analytical
Sciences business generated sales of $1,003.7 million.

For drug discovery, we offer a wide range of
instrumentation, software and consumables, including reagents,
based on our core expertise in fluorescent, chemiluminescent and
radioactive labeling and the detection of nucleic acids and
proteins.

For genetic screening laboratories, we provide
software, reagents and analysis tools to test for various
inherited disorders. These clinical screening programs help
prevent disease by identifying those most at risk. We sell our
genetic screening solutions to public health authorities and
private health care organizations around the world.

For chemical analysis, we offer analytical tools
employing technologies such as molecular and atomic
spectroscopy, high-pressure liquid chromatography, gas
chromatography and thermal analysis. Our instruments and related
software applications measure a range of substances from
bio-molecular matter to organic and inorganic chemicals. We sell
these products to pharmaceutical manufacturers and customers in
the environmental, food and beverage and chemical markets. These
customers use our instruments in various applications to verify
the identity, quality or composition of the materials they
analyze.

Fluid Sciences

Our Fluid Sciences business is a leading provider
of critical fluid control and containment systems for highly
demanding environments such as turbine engines and semiconductor
fabrication facilities. This business has an extensive network
of strategic alliances with major original equipment
manufacturers worldwide. For fiscal 2003, our Fluid Sciences
business generated sales of $179.7 million.

In the aerospace market, we are a leading
provider of sealing and pneumatic systems for large commercial
transport aircraft, military, business and regional jets. Most
major aircraft and turbine engine manufacturers use our products
to reduce leakage and improve reliability. For example, we
design and produce high-pressure accumulators used to moderate
pressure in hydraulic systems that provide additional hydraulic
power when heavy demands are placed on the system. New fleet
orders and maintenance on existing aircraft generally create
demand for our aerospace products and services.

In the semiconductor equipment market, we provide
components, sub-assembly integration and processing services to
many of the world’s leading semiconductor equipment
manufacturers. Our bellows sealing and linear motion devices are
used in more semiconductor wafer-processing equipment worldwide
than any other brand. Building upon our understanding of our
customers’ needs, we have expanded our product offerings to
include a broad range of assemblies and related after-market
services used in semiconductor wafer-processing equipment and
maintenance.

We also provide static and dynamic seals that
reduce emissions and improve efficiency on many new power
generation equipment platforms. Our fluid testing business has
been providing fuel and lubricant testing services for almost
50 years to the gasoline refining and petrochemical
industries.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and
services through their own specialized sales forces. As of
December 28, 2003, we had approximately 2,600 internally
employed sales and service representatives operating in
approximately 40 countries and marketing products and services
in approximately 125 countries. In geographic regions where we
do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize
distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses raw materials and
supplies that are generally readily available in adequate
quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We typically do
not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. In some
cases, we may rely on a single supplier for particular items,
although we believe that we could obtain these items from
alternative suppliers, if necessary.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents
and have patent applications pending in the United States and
abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from
third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable
in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio,
we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and
know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign
trademarks, registered trademarks and trade names for a variety
of our product names, and have applications for the registration
of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and
abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are
important to the development of each of our reporting segments,
but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing
technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop
and maintain the competitive position of each of our reporting
segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or
other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on
our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.



In some cases, we may participate in litigation
or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of
infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’
patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other
intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and
validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property
rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost
to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any
litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant
liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed
intellectual property or cease the sale of a commercial product
or require us to license the disputed property from third
parties. We are currently one of several parties defending
litigation brought by Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life
Sciences, Inc. alleging that our Life and Analytical
Sciences business breached our distributorship and settlement
agreements with the plaintiffs, infringed the plaintiffs’
patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed
torts against the plaintiffs by, among other things, engaging in
commercial development and exploitation of the plaintiffs’
patented products and technology, separately and together with
the other defendants. On July 16, 2003, Enzo Life Sciences
served its new complaint and we subsequently filed an answer
denying the substantive allegations and including a counterclaim
alleging that several of Enzo’s patents are invalid. See
“Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of
this matter.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful
indicator of future business prospects for any of our business
units due to the short lead time required on a majority of our
sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Because of the wide range of our products and
services, we face many different types of competition and
competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and
services and the prices at which these products and services are
sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic
organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and
services and that may have greater financial and other resources
than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods
or services for specialized market segments.

In our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting
segment, we compete on the basis of service level, price,
technological innovation, product differentiation, product
availability and quality and reliability. Competitors range from
multinational organizations with a wide range of products to
specialized firms that in some cases have well-established
market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors in
this reporting segment to increase through the continued
consolidation of competitors.

No single competitor competes directly with our
Optoelectronics reporting segment across its full product range.
However, we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies
in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and
ultraspecialty lighting sources, photodetectors and photodiodes
and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price,
technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product
reliability and quality.

Competition in our Fluid Sciences reporting
segment is typically based on product performance and
innovation, quality, service and price. In a few markets,
competitors are large, diversified engineering and manufacturing
concerns. Most of our competitors, however, are small
specialized manufacturing companies offering limited product
lines for narrow market segments. Competition for lubricant
testing services is primarily from one large non-profit
institute and some customer-owned laboratories, and is mainly
based on quality and price.

We believe we compete effectively in each of the
areas in which our businesses experience competition.

Research and Development

PerkinElmer-sponsored research and development
expenditures were approximately $83.1 million during 2003,
approximately $86.5 million during 2002 and approximately
$80.1 million during 2001.



We directed our research and development efforts
in both 2003 and 2002 primarily in the genetic screening
applications markets and the biopharmaceutical end markets
within our Life and Analytical Sciences business, and in the
medical digital imaging and industrial sensor markets within our
Optoelectronics business.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign,
federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and
regulations. These requirements include those governing
emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the
remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation
of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our
employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, and
comparable state statutes that impose liability for
investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to
fault, in connection with materials that we or our former
businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred,
and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental
investigations and remedial actions at current and former
locations and, along with other companies, have been named a
potentially responsible party for specific waste disposal sites.
We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period in
which our responsibility is established and when the cost can be
reasonably estimated. We have accrued $6.2 million as of
December 28, 2003, representing management’s estimate
of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental
matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any
recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification
arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of
variables, including the stage of the environmental
investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the
nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several
liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur and
the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites
where we are named a potentially responsible party, our
management does not currently anticipate any additional
liability to result from the inability of other significant
named parties to contribute. We expect that these accrued
amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As
assessment and remediation activities progress at each
individual site, we review these liabilities and adjust them to
reflect additional information as it becomes available. There
have been no environmental problems to date that have had or
that we expect to have a material effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. While it is
possible that we may incur a material loss exceeding the amounts
recorded, we do not expect the potential exposure to be
materially different than the amounts recorded.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen
environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more
stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of
existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause
us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of December 28, 2003, we employed
approximately 10,000 employees. Several of our subsidiaries are
parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’
councils. As of December 28, 2003, we employed an aggregate
of approximately 2,100 union and workers’ council
employees. We consider our relations with employees to be
satisfactory.



Financial Information About Reporting
Segments

The table below sets forth sales and operating
profit (loss) by reporting segment for the 2003, 2002 and 2001
fiscal years:

Our Security and Detection Systems,
Telecommunications Components, and Entertainment Lighting
businesses are discontinued operations and therefore have not
been included in the preceding table.

Additional information relating to our reporting
segments for the 2003, 2002, and 2001 fiscal years is as follows:



Financial Information About Geographic
Areas

The following geographic area information for
continuing operations for the 2003, 2002, and 2001 fiscal years
represents sales based on location of external customer and net
property, plant and equipment based on physical location:

Each of our reporting segments conducts business
in, and derives substantial revenue from, various countries
outside the United States. During 2003, we had
$817.6 million in sales from our international operations,
representing approximately 53% of our total sales. During 2003,
we derived approximately 73% of our international sales from our
Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment, approximately
24% of our international sales from our Optoelectronics
reporting segment, and approximately 3% of our international
sales from our Fluid Sciences reporting segment. We anticipate
that sales from international operations will continue to
represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with
international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations,
regional and country-specific political and economic conditions,
foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection
measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks,
staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property
protection risks and differing regulatory requirements.



Item 2.

Properties

As of December 28, 2003, our continuing
operations occupied approximately 3,262,000 square feet. We
own approximately 1,175,000 square feet of this space and
lease the balance. Our headquarters occupies 53,000 square
feet of leased space in Wellesley, Massachusetts. We conduct our
other operations in manufacturing and assembly plants, research
laboratories, administrative offices and other facilities
located in 12 states and 36 foreign countries.

Non-United States facilities account for
approximately 1,448,000 square feet of our owned and leased
property, or approximately 45% of our total occupied space.

Our real property leases are both short-term and
long-term. We believe that our properties are well-maintained
and are adequate for our present requirements.

The following table indicates, as of
December 28, 2003, the approximate square footage of real
property owned and leased attributable to the continuing
operations of each of our reporting segments:

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to various claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters
that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities.
Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and
it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved in a
manner that is unfavorable to us.

We and our subsidiary, EG&G Idaho, Inc.,
were served with a complaint in 1998 naming us as defendants in
a lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the
District of Idaho. Filed by two former employees of EG&G
Idaho under the Civil False Claims Act, the suit named as
defendants several entities that were formerly prime contractors
or subcontractors to the United States Department of Energy at
the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The
plaintiffs alleged that we and the other defendants submitted
false claims to the government for reimbursement of costs and
payment of award fees related to environmental activities that
the defendants knew or should have known had either not been
performed or were performed improperly. In a series of orders
issued in response to various defense motions, the District
Court dismissed most, but not all, of the allegations involving
us. In October 2003, the parties settled the remaining
allegations and stipulated to the dismissal of the suit.

Our subsidiary, EG&G Rocky Flats, Inc.,
and two other companies were served with a complaint in January
2000 naming EG&G Rocky Flats, Inc. as a defendant in a
civil false claim action pending in the United States District
Court for the District of Colorado, involving alleged false
claims arising out of security issues at the United States
Department of Energy’s Rocky Flats Plant. In response to a
motion filed by the United States Department of Justice, the
District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs appealed the
dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit in January 2003.

In papers dated July 1, 2002, Kevin Hatch
filed a purported class action lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civil Action
No. 02-11314 GAO, against PerkinElmer, Inc.,
Gregory L. Summe and Robert F. Friel, on behalf of
himself and purchasers of our common stock between July 15,
2001 and April 11, 2002. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified
amount of damages and claims violations of Sections 10(b)
and 20(a) of, and Rule 10b-5 under, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, alleging various statements made during the
putative class period by PerkinElmer and its management were
misleading with



respect to our prospects and future operating
results. At least eleven virtually identical lawsuits
subsequently have been filed in the United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts against PerkinElmer. The court
granted the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate these
matters, and on January 13, 2003, the plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint. On February 25, 2003, we and the other
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The motion was
opposed by the plaintiffs, and oral arguments concerning the
motion took place on May 5, 2003. On September 30,
2003, the Court issued a memorandum and order denying the motion
to dismiss. On October 10, 2003, we and the other
defendants filed a motion for reconsideration or, in the
alternative, for an order allowing immediate appeal of several
issues of law to the appellate court. On October 23, 2003,
the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion for
reconsideration. Our and the other defendants’ answers to
the amended complaint were filed on November 6, 2003.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo
Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. filed a
complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448,
against Amersham PLC, Amersham Biosciences,
PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.,
Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc.,
Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid Biosciences, Inc.
The six count complaint alleges that we have breached our
distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed
Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud,
and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things,
engaging in commercial development and exploitation of
Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and
together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and
monetary relief. On May 28, 2003, the Court severed the
lawsuit and ordered Enzo Life Sciences to serve individual
complaints against the five defendants. Enzo Life Sciences
served its new complaint on July 16, 2003, and we
subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations
and including a counterclaim alleging that several of
Enzo’s patents are invalid.

On June 14, 2002, we sold our Security and
Detection Systems business to L-3 Communications Corporation.
L-3 and several of its affiliates have been named as defendants
in litigation arising out of the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001. Among the claims in that litigation are
allegations that there were defects in the products of the
Security and Detection Systems business that we sold to L-3. L-3
has asserted that we are contractually obligated to indemnify
L-3 for any liability it may incur as a result of that
litigation.

We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in all
of the above matters. We are currently unable, however, to

Overview

We are a leading provider of scientific
instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical,
biomedical, environmental testing and general industrial
markets. We design, manufacture, market and service products and
systems within three businesses, each constituting one reporting
segment:

•

Life and Analytical
    Sciences.

We are a leading provider of
    drug discovery, genetic screening, and environmental and
    chemical analysis tools, including instruments, reagents,
    consumables and services.

•

Optoelectronics.

We
    provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty
    lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products
    and other specialty end markets.

•

Fluid Sciences.

We
    provide critical fluid control and containment solutions for
    highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and
    semiconductor fabrication facilities.



Formation of our Life and Analytical
    Sciences Business Unit

We combined our Life Sciences and Analytical
Instruments businesses to form our Life and Analytical Sciences
business in the fourth quarter of 2002 to improve our
operational scale, which we believe will enable us to better
serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths
of the combined businesses’ sales, service and research and
development organizations. In the second quarter of 2003, we
completed many of the changes involved in combining the two
businesses, including the integration of facilities and
management reporting and other systems. We have now aggregated
the two segments into one reporting segment for financial
statement purposes, as discrete financial information is now
only available on a combined basis. For comparative purposes we
have disclosed our Life and Analytical Sciences business as one
reporting segment for all periods presented.

In connection with the combination of our Life
Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, we recorded
a $26.0 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter
of 2002 as a result of workforce reductions, facility closures
and contract terminations. These actions occurred during 2003
with the exception of lease commitment payouts and other
spending, which we expect to complete in 2004. We achieved in
excess of the original range of $12 to $25 million in
pre-tax cost savings in fiscal 2003 from the combination of our
Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses relative to
our fiscal 2002 cost levels. We are targeting additional pre-tax
cost savings, from the combination, of between $5 million
and $20 million in fiscal 2004 for combined pre-tax cost
savings of between $30 million and $45 million
relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels. Unforeseen factors may
offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other
benefits from the integration. As a result, our actual cost
savings, if any, could differ or be delayed, compared to our
estimates.

Consolidated Results of Continuing
Operations

Sales

2003 Compared to
2002.

Sales for 2003 were
$1,535.2 million, versus $1,505.0 million during 2002,
an increase of $30.2 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign
exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by
approximately $73 million in 2003, as compared to 2002.
This increase in sales reflects a $12.0 million, or 1%,
increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales,
which grew from $991.7 million in 2002 to $1,003.7 in 2003,
and includes approximately $62.0 million in sales
attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates
compared to 2002. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew
$28.0 million, or 9%, from $323.8 million in 2002 to
$351.8 million in 2003, including approximately
$10.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in
foreign exchange rates compared to 2002. The increased sales in
our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments
were offset by a decrease in sales of $9.8 million, or 5%,
in our Fluid Sciences segment, which declined from
$189.5 million in 2002 to $179.7 million in 2003.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$1,505.0 million, versus $1,525.3 million during 2001,
a decrease of $20.3 million, or 1%. Changes in foreign
exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by
approximately $22 million in 2002, as compared to 2001.
This decrease in sales reflects a $56.4 million, or 15%,
decrease in our Optoelectronics segment sales, which declined
from $380.2 million in 2001 to $323.8 million in 2002.
The decrease in Optoelectronics sales in 2002 was primarily due
to the absence of sales from our specialty lighting businesses
and other discontinued product lines which we divested in 2001
that had accounted for $39.4 million in sales for 2001. Our
Fluid Sciences segment sales declined by $41.1 million, or
18%, from $230.6 million in 2001 to $189.5 million in
2002. The decrease in sales in our Optoelectronics and Fluid
Sciences segments were offset in part by an increase in sales of
$77.2 million, or 8%, in our Life and Analytical Sciences
segment, which grew from $914.5 million in 2001 to
$991.7 million in 2002. This increase includes
approximately $18.0 million in sales attributable to
favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to 2001.
Also contributing to the increased sales in our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment were sales from a full year of
Packard, which we acquired in November 2001. In 2001, we
included only two months, or $40 million, of sales from
Packard in our results of operations. The increase in sales for
2002 in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, was offset in
part by our divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2001 of our
Instruments for Research and Applied Science business, which
contributed $47.4 million in sales in 2001.



Cost of
Sales

2003 Compared to
2002.

Cost of sales for 2003 was
$906.3 million, versus $904.1 million for 2002, an
increase of $2.2 million, or 0.2%. As a percentage of
sales, cost of sales decreased to 59% in 2003 from 60% in
2002, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 100 basis
points from 40% in 2002 to 41% in 2003. The 100 basis
point increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a
2002 $17.2 million inventory adjustment charge recorded
within our Optoelectronics segment. We did not record a similar
charge in 2003. Apart from this adjustment, the gross margin
percentages for the Life and Analytical Sciences,
Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences reporting segments were
substantially unchanged in 2003, as compared to 2002.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Cost of sales for 2002 was
$904.1 million, versus $849.4 million for 2001, an
increase of $54.7 million, or 6%. As a percentage of sales,
cost of sales increased to 60% in 2002 from 56% in 2001,
resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 400 basis points
from 44% in 2001 to 40% in 2002. Of the 400 basis point
decrease in gross margin approximately a 350 basis point
was due to a decrease in gross margin in our Optoelectronics
segment, resulting primarily from a 2002 $17.2 million
inventory adjustment, and 150 basis point to a decrease in
gross margin in our Fluid Sciences segment, offset in part by a
100 basis point increase in gross margin in our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment.

Research and Development
    Expenses

2003 Compared to
2002.

Research and development
expenses for 2003 were $83.1 million versus
$86.5 million in 2002, a decrease of $3.4 million, or
4%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses
decreased to 5.4% in 2003 from 5.7% in 2002, primarily due to
the consolidation of research and development activities to take
advantage of increased synergies and corresponding cost savings
as a result of fewer sites. We directed research and development
efforts during 2003 and 2002 primarily toward genetic screening
and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical
Sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and
industrial sensors within our Optoelectronics reporting segment.
We expect our research and development efforts to continue to
emphasize the health sciences end markets. We expect our
research and development spending for fiscal 2004 to remain
substantially similar to our historical levels in fiscal 2003
and 2002.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Research and development
expenses for 2002 were $86.5 million versus
$80.1 million in 2001, an increase of $6.4 million or
8%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses
increased to 5.7% in 2002 from 5.3% in 2001, principally as a
result of the inclusion of spending associated with the Packard
operations. We directed research and development efforts during
2002 and 2001 primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic
screening applications as well as biopharmaceutical end markets
within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment and
biomedical end markets within our Optoelectronics reporting
segment.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses

2003 Compared to
2002.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 2003 were $386.4 million,
versus $431.3 million for 2002, a decrease of
$44.9 million, or 10%. As a percentage of sales, selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased 350 basis
points to 25.2% in 2003 from 28.7% in 2002. Proportionately, the
decrease as a percentage of sales of 350 basis points in
2003 was due to a 200 basis point decrease attributable to
reduced expenses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, a
100 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses
in our Optoelectronics segment and a 50 basis point
decrease attributable to reduced expenses in our Fluid Sciences
segment. The overall decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to productivity
improvements throughout our company, including cost savings we
derived from restructuring actions.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 2002 were $431.3 million,
versus $376.9 million for 2001, an increase of
$54.4 million, or 14%. As a percentage of sales, selling,
general and administrative expenses increased 400 basis
points to 28.7% in 2002 from 24.7% in 2001. Proportionately, the
increase as a percentage of sales of 400 basis points was
due to a 250 basis point increase attributable to increased
expenses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment primarily
due to integration costs and an



overall decline in sales, a 20 basis point
increase attributable to increased expenses in our
Optoelectronics segment and a 130 basis point increase
attributable to a decline in sales in our Fluid Sciences segment.

Restructuring (Reversals) Charges,
    Net

2003 Compared to
2002.

Restructuring (reversals)
charges, net for 2003 was a reversal of $3.5 million, the
combination of our 2003 changes in estimate of $5.8 million
and our 2003 charges of $2.3 million, versus a charge of
$35.7 million during 2002. The following table summarizes
our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by
restructuring plan during 2003, 2002 and 2001:

Q2 2003 Plan:

During 2003, we incurred a $2.3 million
restructuring charge in our Life and Analytical Sciences and
Optoelectronics segments, which we refer to as our Q2 2003
Plan. The purpose of the restructuring was to further improve
performance and take advantage of synergies between our former
Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses which we
began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002. The principal
actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due
to the continued integration of Life and Analytical Sciences
business in a European manufacturing and customer care center as
well as headcount reduction at one of the Optoelectronics
manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for
several product lines. We planned to reduce headcount by 120. We
recorded restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows:

This restructuring charge was primarily recorded
in the second quarter of 2003. However, we recorded additional
charges of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in the third
and fourth quarters of 2003, as required by SFAS 146, as
some employees who were notified of their employment termination
in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time
prior to receiving their severance. In addition, in the fourth
quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of
$0.4 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a
result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to
ultimate termination and, accordingly, lower severance costs.

We completed all actions under the Q2 2003
Plan by December 28, 2003, with the exception of nine
headcount reductions that we expect to complete by the second
quarter of 2004.

Q4 2002 Plan:

In connection with our decision to combine our
Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to
reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies, we recorded a
pre-tax restructuring charge of $26.0 million during the
fourth quarter of 2002, which we refer to as our Q4 2002 Plan.
The Q4 2002 Plan allowed us to combine many business
functions worldwide, with the intention to better serve our
customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the
businesses’ sales, service and research and development
organizations. The principal actions in the Q4 2002 Plan
included planned workforce reductions of 546 people,
closure of approximately 20 facilities and disposal of
underutilized assets.



The Q4 2002 Plan resulted in the integration of
our United States Life and Analytical Sciences sales, service
and customer care centers, the integration of European customer
care and finance centers, the merging of a former Life Sciences
European manufacturing facility with a former Analytical
Instruments European manufacturing facility, and the merging of
a portion of a former Life Sciences research and development
facility in Europe with a former Analytical Instruments facility
in Europe.

During 2003, we expended $13.8 million to
execute these actions. In addition, we recorded a reversal of
$6.2 million in the Q4 2002 Plan due to both higher
than expected employee attrition rates in several countries
prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for
actual terminations.

The remaining liability associated with the
Q4 2002 Plan represents severance related to
65 employees and lease commitments. We expect to settle the
remaining severance liability by the second quarter of 2004. The
lease commitments on unoccupied buildings extend until 2005.

Q1 2002 Plan:

During the first quarter of 2002, our management
developed a plan to restructure several businesses. We refer to
these activities as our Q1 2002 Plan. The plan resulted in
pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $9.2 million. The
principal actions in the Q1 2002 Plan included planned
workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization
activities, including the closure of a manufacturing facility,
disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions.

Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment totaled $5.5 million. These
charges comprised $4.4 million in severance costs,
$1.0 million in asset impairments and $.1 million in
lease commitments. The charges were a result of actions we took
as a response to decreased sales of components in our Life and
Analytical Sciences business. These actions under the charges
primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing
location and streamlining of the global sales and research and
development organizations, primarily in Europe, Japan and the
Pacific Rim. We took these actions to reduce the number of
employees in components of our business that had experienced
declining demand.

Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Optoelectronics
segment totaled $3.7 million, comprising $3.5 million
in severance costs and $0.2 million in asset write-offs.
This charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of
management structure within our Optoelectronics reporting
segment which led to a flatter and less expensive organization
structure.

Total headcount was reduced by 276.

During 2003, we recorded a restructuring reversal
of $1.0 million in the Q1 2002 Plan primarily due to lower
than expected employee separation costs associated with our
Optoelectronics segment. The remaining $0.1 million
represented lease commitments on a closed facility and will be
paid in the first quarter of 2004.

Q4 2001 Plan:

During the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection
with the integration of Packard and a restructuring of our sales
offices in Europe, we recorded a restructuring charge of
$9.2 million in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment.
We refer to these activities as our Q4 2001 Plan. The principal
actions in the Q4 2001 Plan included the closing or
consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in
Europe, as well as costs associated with the closure of a
manufacturing facility in Europe, the closure of leased
manufacturing facilities in the United States and the
disposal of related assets. These actions were designed to
streamline the organization and take advantage of the synergies
offered by the Packard acquisition as they relate to the legacy
Life and Analytical Science segment. We terminated a total of
272 employees.

In 2003, we recorded an additional pre-tax
restructuring charge associated with the Q4 2001 Plan of
$1.8 million. This charge was primarily due to additional
severance and severance related benefits of the previously
identified employees associated with the closure of our European
manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences
segment, and will be paid in 2004.



In-Process Research and Development
    Expenses:

In-process research and development expenses for
2001 were $71.5 million and consisted primarily of
in-process research and development expenses related
specifically to projects we acquired in our acquisition of
Packard within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting
segment. We determined the value of these projects based on
discounted probable future cash flows on a project-by-project
basis. We prepared revenue and expense projections as well as
technology assumptions through 2008. We discounted the
projected cash flows using discount rates specific to each
project derived from a cost of capital adjusted upward for the
stage of completion. These adjusted discount rates ranged
between 20-37% based upon the remaining effort and risk of
completion. The efforts required to develop the in-process
technologies into commercially viable products principally
relate to the completion of all planning, designing,
prototyping, verification and testing activities that were
necessary to establish that the products could be designed to
meet their design specifications, including function, features
and technical performance requirements. Failure to complete any
of these projects has not had a material adverse impact on our
results of operations or financial condition.

We classified Packard acquisition projects for
which the charge is associated as follows:

Gains on Dispositions

2003 Compared to
2002.

Dispositions resulted in a net
gain of $2.7 million in 2003 versus a net gain of
$5.2 million in 2002. Gains on dispositions in 2003
included $2.2 million from sales of facilities and
$0.5 million from post closing adjustments relating to the
resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our
Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business, which we
refer to as IRAS. Gains on dispositions in 2002 included
$4.4 million from the sale of facilities and
$0.8 million from post closing entries relating to our sale
of our IRAS business, which was formerly part of our Life
and Analytical Sciences segment.



2002 Compared to
2001.

Dispositions resulted in a net
gain of $5.2 million in 2002 versus a net gain of
$33.2 million in 2001. Gains on dispositions in 2002
included $4.4 million from sales of facilities and
$0.8 million from post closing adjustments relating to the
sale of our IRAS business. Gains on dispositions in 2001
included $32.3 million from the sale of our IRAS business
and $7.2 million from dispositions within our
Optoelectronics and Life and Analytical Sciences reporting
segments, offset in part by a $6.3 million loss on the sale
of our Voltarc Technologies business, formerly part of our
Optoelectronics reporting segment.

Amortization of Intangible
    Assets

2003 Compared to
2002.

Amortization of intangible
assets was $28.3 million for both 2003 and 2002. Slight
increases in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment
amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange offset by
slight decreases in amortization in the Optoelectronics and
Fluid Sciences segments in 2003 compared to 2002.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Amortization of intangible
assets for 2002 was $28.3 million versus $43.9 million
for 2001, a decrease of $15.6 million or 36%. The 2001
amortization expense included $27.1 million related to the
amortization of goodwill. We discontinued the amortization of
goodwill upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 at the
beginning of 2002. The year over year increase in intangible
asset amortization was the result of the amortization on
intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets that arose from the acquisition of Packard.

Interest and Other Expense,
    Net

Interest and other expense, net consisted of the
following:

2003 Compared to
2002.

Interest and other expense, net
for 2003 was $56.4 million versus $32.9 million for
2002, an increase of $23.5 million or 71%. The increase in
interest and other expense, net in 2003 as compared to 2002, was
due primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from
our December 2002 financing. A more complete discussion of our
liquidity and our prospective costs to borrow can be seen under
the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” The
remaining increase in interest and other expense, net of
$3.0 million was due primarily to our increased
acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs of
$1.9 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term
debt during 2003 versus $0.4 million in 2002 and
$0.6 million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth
quarter of 2003 in connection with amending our credit facility
to reduce the interest rate margin applicable to our term loan.
In January 2004, $100 million of our outstanding fixed rate
debt was swapped to a floating rate with swap instruments that
reset semi-annually in arrears based on six-month USD Libor. We
expect interest expense in 2004 to decrease due to lower
outstanding debt balances, lower interest rate margin on our
term loan due to the amendment of our credit facility in the
fourth quarter of 2003 and the expected benefit derived from our
January 2004 swap instruments identified above.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Interest and other expense, net
for 2002 was $32.9 million versus $29.2 million for
2001, an increase of $3.7 million or 13%. The increase in
interest and other expense, net in 2002, as compared to 2001,
was due primarily to losses on sales of investments in 2002, as
compared to gains in 2001 of $4.3 million. This increase
was offset in part by a decline in interest expense to
$32.1 million in 2002 from $37.7 million in 2001
resulting from decreased levels of indebtedness and lower
associated interest rates. The



$0.4 million in debt extinguishment in 2002
is comprised of (1) $3.2 million in fees and
previously capitalized issuance costs written-off in connection
with our December 2002 debt refinancing transactions; (2) a
$5.6 million call premium paid in the first quarter of 2002
upon our extinguishment of the debt we assumed in our
acquisition of Packard; and (3) an offsetting
$8.4 million gain realized on our repurchase of a portion
of our zero coupon convertible debentures.

Provision/ Benefit for Income
    Taxes

2003 Compared to
2002.

The 2003 provision for income
taxes was $25.9 million, versus a benefit of
$4.4 million in 2002. Our effective tax rate is primarily
attributable to geographic income patterns. Our 2003 effective
tax rate was 32% as compared to our 2002 effective tax rate of
52%. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a
relatively high ratio of permanent tax differences to income
(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.

2002 Compared to
2001.

The benefit for income taxes for
2002 was $4.4 million, versus a provision of
$59.1 million during 2001. As mentioned above, our
effective tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic
income patterns. Our 2002 effective tax rate was 52% as compared
to our 2001 effective tax rate of 59%. The change in our
effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced profitability in
2002 and in-process research and development charges associated
with our Packard acquisition, which were not deductible for tax
purposes.

Discontinued Operations

We recorded the following gains and losses, which
we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued
operations, during the years ended December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002:

During 2003, we settled various claims under
certain long-term contracts and transition services with our
Technical Services business, which we sold in August 1999. The
net settlement and the reversal of certain previously
established contingencies resulted in a pre-tax gain of
$6.5 million that we recognized in 2003 and included in
gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations.

In June 2002, we completed the sale of our
Security and Detection Systems business for cash consideration
of approximately $100.0 million and a net working capital
adjustment, the amount of which has yet to be finalized. We
recorded a net pre-tax gain of approximately $15.0 million
pursuant to this transaction in 2002 as a gain on the
disposition of a discontinued operation. We accounted for our
Security and Detection Systems business as a discontinued
operation in accordance with APB No. 30, and accordingly,
the results of operations and related cash flows of this
business through the disposal date have been segregated from
continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our
consolidated income statements. We present the resulting gain
from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions
of discontinued operations, net of income tax on our 2002
consolidated income statement. Adjustments relating to this sale
resulted in a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of
$2.4 million in 2003, primarily due to revised estimates of
the working capital adjustment.



Also in June 2002, our Board of Directors
approved a plan to shut down our Telecommunications Components
business and a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business
as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth
opportunities. We have reflected both businesses as discontinued
operations in our consolidated financial statements. As of
June 29, 2003, we had exited our Entertainment Lighting
business completing the sale of a substantial portion of that
business for cash consideration of $1.4 million and
abandoned the remaining assets. Sales and losses from
discontinued operations for 2003 until that time were
$5.6 million and $1.6 million respectively. As of
June 30, 2002, we had shut down our Telecommunications
Components business.

Effect of Accounting Change

As required by SFAS 142, we completed the
transitional impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of
January 1, 2002. In connection with the adoption of this
standard, we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of
our reporting units and determined that, based on decreased
demand for certain specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in
the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller
markets, the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less
than its carrying value. With the assistance of valuation
specialists and using a discounted cash flow model, we
determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was
in excess of the fair value of that goodwill. As a result, we
recorded an impairment charge totaling $117.8 million as a
cumulative effect of an accounting change. The entire transition
adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our
Optoelectronics reporting segment. In addition, as part of our
ongoing compliance with SFAS No. 142, we completed our
annual assessment of goodwill using a measurement date of
January 1, 2003. This annual assessment did not result in
an impairment charge.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Significant Acquisitions

In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of
Packard for a purchase price of approximately
$764.0 million, in exchange for approximately
22 million shares of our common stock and our assumption of
approximately $118.2 million in debt that we subsequently
redeemed in March 2002. The acquisition extended our
capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation
and strengthened our position as a global provider of
comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions. In connection
with the Packard acquisition, we initially recorded
approximately $33 million for integration charges. The
Packard integration plans included initiatives to integrate the
operations of Packard, and principally comprise amounts related
to employee separation costs for approximately 200 individuals,
the termination of leases and other contractual obligations and
asset write-offs in connection with these actions. In the fourth
quarter of 2002, we finalized our estimates of severance costs
and determined that our initial estimates were too high,
principally due to actual severance costs per employee being
lower than planned. As a result, we reversed $11.9 million
of severance costs in the integration accrual in the fourth
quarter of 2002 with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill.
We also reversed $4.0 million related to the termination of
leases and other contractual obligations in the fourth quarter
of 2002 with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill due to
changes in our estimate of our lease obligations. The total
reversal in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $15.9 million.
Therefore, the net integration charge related to our purchase of
Packard totaled $17.1 million. The integration activities
were completed in early 2003 with the exception of
$0.9 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities
exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2004. These integration
activities are linked to the Q4 2001 Plan and are disclosed in
Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in
this annual report on Form 10-K.



The following table summarizes integration
reserve activity during 2003, 2002 and 2001 related to the
acquisition of Packard:

In July 2000, we completed our acquisition of NEN
Life Sciences, Inc., a provider of drug discovery products,
services, reagents and technologies to the life sciences
industry. We recorded a $4.0 million integration reserve
related to the acquisition of NEN. The NEN restructuring plan
included approximately $3.8 million in termination and
employment related costs of individuals principally based in
NEN’s headquarters and operations center and
$.2 million of lease termination costs. $3.4 million
of the termination and employment related costs remained as of
the end of fiscal 2000. The integration activities occurred
concurrently with our restructuring activities of 2000. The
following table summarizes integration reserve activity during
2001 related to the acquisition of NEN:

In May 1999, we completed our acquisition of the
Analytical Instruments Division of PE Corp. for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $425 million. As part of
the Analytical Instruments acquisition, we incurred integration
charges to merge the Analytical Instruments business with our
existing business. The Analytical Instruments integration plan
included initiatives to integrate the operations of the acquired
businesses and reduce overhead. The primary components of these
plans related to: (1) employee termination benefits and
related costs for approximately 600 individuals, (2)
consolidation or shutdown of certain operational facilities
worldwide, and (3) termination of certain leases and other
contractual obligations. The integration activities were
completed in 2002.



The following table summarizes integration
reserve activity during 2002 and 2001 related to our acquisition
of Analytical Instruments:

Contingencies

We are conducting a number of environmental
investigations and remedial actions at our current and former
locations and, along with other companies, have been named a
potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites.
We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that
our responsibility is established and when the cost can be
reasonably estimated. We have accrued $6.2 million as of
December 28, 2003, representing our management’s
estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known
environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does
not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or
indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject
to a number of variables, including the stage of the
environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible
contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible
joint and several liability, the timeframe over which
remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws
and regulations. For sites where we have been named a
potentially responsible party, our management does not currently
anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability
of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that
such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to
ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at
each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and
adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes
available. There have been no environmental problems to date
that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect
on our financial position or results of operations. While it is
possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may
be incurred, we do not expect the potential exposure to be
materially different from the amounts we recorded.

We and certain of our officers have been named as
defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs
have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with
respect to our prospects and future operating results. We
believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we
intend to contest the actions vigorously. We are currently
unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss,
if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters.

We have received a notice from the Internal
Revenue Service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for
1997 and 1998. We are challenging many of the proposed
adjustments. We believe that the ultimate outcome of the notices
will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of
operations or financial position.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing
Operations

Life and Analytical Sciences

2003 Compared to
2002.

Sales for 2003 were
$1,003.7 million, versus $991.7 million in 2002, an
increase of $12.0 million, or 1%. Changes in foreign
exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by
approximately $61 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The
favorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was
offset in part by reduced unit sales volume. The following
analysis compares selected sales by



market and product type for 2003, as compared to
2002, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. Sales to environmental and chemical analysis
customers increased $22.7 million, sales to genetic
screening customers increased $6.3 million and our
OneSource

TM

laboratory service sales increased by
$14.8 million. These increases were offset by a
$31.8 million decrease in sales to biopharmaceutical
customers, primarily in sales of liquid handling instruments and
radiochemical reagents, as general biopharmaceutical market
demand remained weak throughout 2003. Sales by type of product
included increases in sales of consumables of
$23.5 million, and service of $14.8 million, partially
offset by decreases in sales of instruments of
$26.3 million.

Operating profit for 2003 was $94.7 million,
versus $27.4 million in 2002, an increase of
$67.3 million. The increase in 2003 as compared to 2002,
was primarily the result of approximately $43.0 million of
overall cost savings in 2003 associated with restructuring and
integration activities, mainly due to a reduction in the number
of employees and the elimination of excess facilities. The
increase in operating profit in 2003, as compared to 2002, was
also due to approximately $31.5 million of net
restructuring charges included in our results for 2002, compared
to a net restructuring credit of $1.9 million in 2003.
Amortization of intangibles was $26.0 million for the year
ended December 28, 2003, versus $25.5 million for the
year ended December 29, 2002.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$991.7 million, versus $914.5 million in 2001, an
increase of $77.2 million, or 8%. The increase in sales in
2002, as compared to 2001, was primarily because our results for
2002 included a full year of results from Packard, which we
acquired in November 2001, and our results for 2001 included
only two months, or $40 million, of results from Packard.
Sales by Packard for the first ten months of 2001 prior to
acquisition were approximately $165 million. Partially
offsetting the effects in 2002 of including the results of
Packard was the absence of results in 2002 from our IRAS
business, which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2001. Sales
from that business were $47.4 million in 2001. Changes in
foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by
approximately $18 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The
following analysis compares selected sales by market and product
type for 2002, as compared to 2001, and includes the effect of
foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to biopharmaceutical
customers increased $99.4 million, due to the full year
impact of the Packard acquisition, service sales increased by
$33.6 million, and sales to genetic screening customers
increased $8.5 million. These increases were offset in part
by a $16.9 million decrease in sales to environmental and
chemical analysis customers and our IRAS divestiture. Sales by
type of product included increases in sales of consumables of
$40.1 million, service of $33.6 million and
instruments of $50.9 million, all partially offset by the
absence of sales from our divested IRAS business. Sales of our
IRAS business in 2001 were $47.4 million.

Operating profit for 2002 was $27.4 million,
versus $31.4 million in 2001, a decrease of
$4.0 million, or 13%. Items contributing to this decrease
in operating profit included restructuring charges in 2002 which
were $31.5 million, versus $8.7 million in 2001 and
gains from dispositions of businesses which were only
$5.2 million in 2002, versus $32.1 million in 2001.
Increases in operating profit year over year included charges
primarily related to the integration and reorganization of
Packard, which decreased from $27.8 million in 2001 to
$4.8 million in 2002. Operating profit for 2001 also
included a $69.0 million charge associated with acquired
in-process research and development associated with our
acquisition of Packard. The favorable impact on operating profit
in 2002 from additional sales volume was more than offset by the
inclusion of additional costs related to Packard for the full
year. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were
$25.6 million for 2002 and $34.2 million for 2001.

Optoelectronics

2003 Compared to
2002.

Sales for 2003 were
$351.8 million, versus $323.8 million for 2002, an
increase of $28.0 million, or 9%. Changes in foreign
exchange rates increased sales by approximately
$10.0 million, or 3%. The following analysis compares
selected sales by product line for 2003, as compared to 2002,
and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Sales of specialty lighting products increased by
$20.2 million due to growth in sales of flash products and
sales of digital imaging products increased by
$17.7 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and
radiotherapy digital x-ray detector products. These



increases were offset in part by sales decreases
totaling $9.9 million in our sensors, lithography, and
fiber optic test product lines due to limited demand in these
end markets.

Operating profit for 2003 was $42.2 million,
versus an operating loss of $4.0 million for 2002, an
increase of $46.2 million. The operating loss for 2002
includes a charge of $17.2 million for an inventory write
down which was not repeated in 2003. 2003 included a net
restructuring reversal of $1.8 million compared to a net
restructuring charge of $3.7 million in 2002. Increased
sales and productivity improvements, including improved
manufacturing performance and reduced operating expenses, and a
headcount reduction of more than 200, contributed a total of
approximately $20.0 million in additional operating profit
in 2003 compared to 2002. Amortization of intangible assets was
$1.2 million for 2003 and $1.3 million for 2002.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$323.8 million, versus $380.2 million for 2001, a
decrease of $56.4 million, or 15%. The decrease in sales in
2002 was primarily due to the absence of sales from divested
specialty lighting businesses and product lines which accounted
for $39.4 million in sales for 2001. Changes in foreign
exchange rates increased sales by approximately
$3.0 million, or 1%. The following analysis compares
selected sales by product line for 2002, as compared to 2001,
and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. Sales of digital imaging products increased by
$30.2 million due primarily to increased sales of digital
x-ray detector products. Sales of sensor products decreased by
$12.3 million and sales within our fiber optic test and
lithography businesses decreased $35.6 million as a result
of weak market demand. Sales decreased by $38.7 million in
our specialty lighting products business, mainly due to the
previously referenced divested businesses and product lines.

Operating loss for 2002 was $4.0 million,
versus an operating profit of $51.3 million for 2001, a
decrease of $55.3 million. The decrease in 2002 operating
profit was primarily the result of lower sales, the inclusion in
2002 of an inventory write down of $17.2 million and a
restructuring charge of $3.7 million. Goodwill and
intangible asset amortization was $1.3 million for 2002 and
$7.0 million for 2001.

Fluid Sciences

2003 Compared to
2002.

Sales for 2003 were
$179.7 million, versus $189.5 million for 2002, a
decrease of $9.8 million, or 5%. Changes in foreign
exchange rates increased sales by approximately $2 million,
or 1%. The following analysis compares selected sales by product
line for 2003, as compared to 2002, and includes the effects of
changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales declines of
$4.4 million in our semiconductor products due to declining
demand, and $2.7 million in our energy technology products,
were the most significant contributors to the reduction in sales
in 2003 compared to 2002. In addition, sales to our aerospace
and fluid testing customers declined modestly by
$1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in two
difficult markets.

Operating profit for 2003 was $17.9 million,
versus $17.5 million for 2002, an increase of
$0.4 million, or 2%. The increase in operating profit
resulted primarily from shifting production to lower cost
locations in Asia, cost controls, cost reduction actions and
other productivity improvements resulting from Six Sigma and
lean manufacturing initiatives that more than offset an
operating profit decrease due to reduced sales. Amortization of
intangible assets was $1.1 million for 2003 and
$1.5 million for 2002.

2002 Compared to
2001.

Sales for 2002 were
$189.5 million, versus $230.6 million for 2001, a
decrease of $41.1 million, or 18%. The decrease in sales in
2002, as compared to 2001, was primarily attributable to a
reduction in sales of $31.6 million in aerospace products
where market conditions deteriorated in the wake of the events
of September 11. Sales decreases of $6.1 million in
the fluid testing business and $3.6 million in the
semiconductor business also contributed to the sales decline in
2002 compared to 2001. These decreases were offset by a
$0.2 million increase in our energy technology business in
2002, as compared to 2001.

Operating profit for 2002 was $17.5 million,
versus $57.3 million for 2001, a decrease of
$39.8 million, or 69%. The decrease in operating profit in
2002, as compared to 2001, was due primarily to the 2002 sales
decline discussed above and associated underutilization of
capacity, as well as the cost of relocating manufacturing
facilities to lower cost locations. The 2001 operating profit
included $6.6 million in gains from the sale of two
businesses during the first half of 2001. Goodwill and
intangible asset amortization expenses were $1.5 million
for 2002 and $2.7 million for 2001.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses,
make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long-term
liabilities and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal
sources of funds are from our operations and the capital
markets, particularly the debt markets. In the next twelve
months, we anticipate that our operations will generate
sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital
expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our
common stock. Beyond the next twelve months, we expect to use
internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our
debt and other long-term liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the
availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets
    in which we sell our products and services,

•

changes in our working capital
    requirements, and

•

our ability to successfully repatriate cash
    balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling
    domestic obligations.

Principal factors that could affect our ability
to obtain cash from external sources include:

Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2003

Operating
Activities.

Net cash generated by
continuing operations was $160.4 million in 2003.
Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities
during 2003 was net income from continuing operations of
$55.0 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of
$72.2 million. Contributing to the decrease in working
capital in 2003 were reductions in accounts receivable of
$43.4 million and inventory of $28.2 million. In
general, accounts receivable and inventory levels declined due
to our focus on customer payment terms as well as enhanced
inventory management. Accounts receivable also decreased as a
result of increased use of our accounts receivable
securitization facility, which increased $16 million, from
$29 million at December 29, 2002 to $45 million
at December 28, 2003. Cash outlays for accrued expenses,
restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled
$51.9 million during 2003, primarily as a result of
payments toward restructuring plans and other obligations. We
expect our restructuring expenditures to be reduced in 2004.

Investing
Activities.

In 2003, we withdrew
$187.5 million of cash held in escrow to retire
substantially all of our remaining outstanding indebtedness
under our zero coupon convertible debentures. In 2003, we made
capital expenditures of $16.6 million mainly in the areas
of tooling and productivity improvements along with system and
facility costs related to integration activities. Net proceeds
from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2003
were $4.4 million. We derived $3.3 million of these
proceeds from the sale of a building made redundant due to
integration activities. In 2004, we expect to incur
approximately $40 million in capital expenditures.

Financing
Activities.

In 2003, we used
$298.4 million of net cash for financing activities. We
expended $187.5 million of cash withdrawn from our
designated escrow account along with approximately
$2.4 million of available cash to redeem our outstanding
zero coupon convertible debentures. Debt reductions during 2003
also included $70.0 million of cash used to repay a portion
of our term loan. In December 2003, we amended our credit
facility to, among other things, reduce the interest rate
applicable to our term loan. We paid



$4.4 million in transaction fees during 2003
in connection with that amendment. We also paid
$35.4 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds
from the exercise of employee stock options of $3.6 million
in 2003.

Fiscal Year 2002

Operating
Activities.

Net cash generated by
continuing operations was $114.5 million in 2002.
Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities
during 2002 was a decrease in working capital of
$97.4 million. The working capital decrease during 2002
reflects improved working capital management as well as a
$17.2 million inventory adjustment within our
Optoelectronics reporting segment, offset in part by a net
decrease of $8.0 million in proceeds from our receivable
securitization program. We decreased inventory levels by
$48.2 million during 2002, including a $17.2 million
Optoelectronics inventory adjustment, on lower sales volume.
Cash outlays for accrued expenses, restructuring and other
assets and liabilities totaled $49.2 million during 2002,
primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and
the settlement of payroll, professional fees, hedging and other
obligations.

Investing
Activities.

In 2002, our investing
activities used $150.8 million of cash, including placing
$186.5 million of cash in escrow, for the purpose of
retiring some of our outstanding indebtedness under our zero
coupon convertible debentures. We made capital expenditures of
$37.8 million mainly in the areas of tooling and process
improvement for our drug discovery tools business and other
products for biopharmaceutical applications. We also expended
$30.0 million in the settlement of a lease obligation on
our Fremont, California facility resulting in our purchase of
this facility. Net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses
and fixed assets during 2002 of $126.0 million were
primarily from approximately $96.2 million in net proceeds
received from the sale of our Security and Detection Systems
business during the second quarter of 2002 and approximately
$29.8 million associated with the sale of facilities. Cash
outflows of $22.5 million associated with acquisitions
related primarily to the settlement of liabilities incurred in
connection with the Packard acquisition.

Financing
Activities.

In 2002, we generated
$24.5 million of net cash from financing activities. Our
gross debt levels increased by $81.4 million to
$805.5 million at December 29, 2002. Included in this
amount was $186.5 million of our outstanding indebtedness
under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not
tendered by holders as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions
for which we had $186.5 million of cash held in escrow at
December 29, 2002 for the purpose of retiring the
untendered indebtedness. Reductions in debt included
$110.3 million of 6.8% notes due in 2005 and
$304.3 million of zero coupon convertible debentures, both
of which we repurchased as part of our 2002 debt refinancing
transactions. Debt reductions in 2002 also included
$118.2 million of 9.375% senior subordinated ten-year
notes issued by Packard in March 1997, which we repurchased at a
rate of 104.688%, and $5.5 million in other credit
facilities we paid down during 2002. Offsetting these reductions
was our December 2002 issuance of senior subordinated notes
which generated proceeds of $297.5 million and our
establishment of a term loan which generated proceeds of
$315.0 million. In connection with these debt issuances and
terminations, we paid $15.8 million in fees during 2002. We
also paid $35.3 million in dividends and received net cash
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of
$12.9 million in 2002.

In December 2002, we entered
into a senior credit facility. This facility is comprised of a
six-year term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a
$100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility. In
2003, we made $70 million of principal payments on the term
loan. Accordingly, at December 28, 2003 we had
$245 million outstanding under our term loan with no
outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit
facility at December 28, 2003 or at any other time during
the year. This credit facility is secured primarily by a portion
of our subsidiaries domestic assets.

In April 2003, we amended our senior credit
facility to (1) allow for the sale of our Entertainment
Lighting business under the final negotiated terms of that sale
and (2) to ensure conformity between the credit agreement
governing the facility and the financial covenants negotiated
with the lead arranger, Merrill Lynch. The amendment corrected a
drafting error in the definition of consolidated interest
expense. Under the initial



agreement, consolidated interest expense was
erroneously defined as being calculated using pro forma,
annualized interest expense beginning in the first quarter of
2003 compared to the intended calculation using a rolling
quarter methodology as originally agreed. The definition of
consolidated interest expense under the amended agreement was
changed to properly state the calculation as a rolling
four-quarter methodology.

In December 2003, we amended our senior credit
facility to reduce the margin paid on the term loan as well as
to amend several restrictive covenants. Interest rates under the
senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the
revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either
the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. The base rate is the
higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time
to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds
rate plus 50 basis points.

The applicable margin for the term loan was
amended to 225 basis points for the Eurodollar rate, from
the original 400 basis points, and to 125 basis points
for the base rate, from the original 300 basis points. The
applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit
facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the
prior quarter.

We may allocate all or a portion of our
indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based
upon the margin over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At
December 28, 2003, the Eurodollar rate was approximately
114 basis points and the base rate was 400 basis
points resulting in an Eurodollar interest rate on the senior
credit facility of 339 basis points.

The term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal
quarterly installments of $0.8 million of the outstanding
balance until December 2007, and thereafter in four equal
quarterly installments of 25% of the then outstanding balance
until December 2008. Additionally, annual payments of 50% of
excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement are payable
six months following the end of each fiscal year. In 2003, we
made $70 million in principal payments on the term loan.
The revolving credit facility is available to us through
December 2007 for our working capital needs. At no point in
fiscal 2003, did we have any outstanding principal balance under
the revolving credit facility.

Our senior credit facility contains covenants
that require us to maintain specific financial ratios, including:

As of December 28, 2003, and at all other
times during fiscal 2003, we were in compliance with all
applicable covenants.

8 7/8% Notes.

In December 2002, we issued and sold ten-year senior
subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of
$300.0 million. We received $297.5 million in gross
proceeds from the issuance. We recorded deferred issuance costs
of $7.0 million as a non-current asset. The debt, which
matures in January 2013, is unsecured but is guaranteed by
substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Interest on our
8 7/8% notes is payable semi-annually on
January 15 and July 15. Interest payments began on
July 15, 2003. In January 2004, we swapped the fixed rate
on $100 million of these notes to a floating rate using
swap instruments which reset semi-annually in arrears based upon
six-month USD LIBOR. If a change of control occurs, each holder
of 8 7/8% notes may require us to repurchase some or
all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest. Before
January 15, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
principal amount of our 8 7/8% notes with the net
proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108.875% of the
principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains
outstanding after the redemption. We may redeem some or all of
our 8 7/8% notes at any time on or after
January 15, 2008, at a redemption price of 104.438%. The
redemption price decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009,
to 101.479% on January 15, 2010 and to 100% on
January 15, 2011. The debt is subordinated to our senior
credit facility. Our 8 7/8% notes contain financial
and other covenants. Most of these covenants terminate if the
notes obtain an investment grade rating by



Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
and Moody’s Investors Service. At December 28, 2003,
and at all times during fiscal 2003, we were in compliance with
all applicable covenants.

Zero Coupon Convertible
Debentures.

Through the first quarter
of 2003, we repurchased $344.7 million in accreted amount
of our zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in open
market purchases and through a December 2002 tender offer. We
redeemed the remaining $157.4 million of accreted value of
zero coupon debentures on August 7, 2003 in accordance with
their terms. We used approximately $155.0 million held in
escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit
facility along with available cash of approximately
$2.4 million, to redeem the zero coupon convertible
debentures. As of December 28, 2003 the zero coupon
convertible debentures have been fully retired.

6.8% Notes.

In
December 2002, we initiated a tender offer for all of our
outstanding 6.8% notes. We completed the tender offer and
repurchased all but $4.7 million of these notes as of
December 26, 2002. We paid consent payments pursuant to a
consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer.
The consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the
restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our
6.8% notes as of December 29, 2002. We may from time
to time repurchase outstanding 6.8% notes through open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise. These notes are due to be paid in 2005.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Securitization
    Facility

In December 2001, we established a wholly owned
consolidated subsidiary to purchase, on a revolving basis,
certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously
sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a
financial institution. In September 2003, we amended the
facility to increase total funding capacity from
$50 million to $65 million to expand our sources of
liquidity. Amounts funded under this facility were
$45.0 million at December 28, 2003 and
$29.0 million at December 29, 2002. As of
December 28, 2003, we had approximately $20 million of
undrawn capacity available under the facility. The facility had
an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus
120 basis points as of December 28, 2003. The facility
includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior
unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or
above, as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At
December 28, 2003, we had a senior unsecured credit rating
of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services, and of Ba2 with a stable outlook
from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2004, we entered
into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable
securitization facility to January 28, 2005 as well as
reduce the underlying cost of the facility. Cost reductions in
the new agreement would result in an effective interest rate of
approximately LIBOR plus 90 basis points based on the drawn
balance of $45 million as of December 28, 2003. We
expect to renew this facility again in January 2005 as it
currently provides us a vehicle to accelerate the cash
collection of customer receivables.

Dividends

Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly
cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2003
and 2002, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per
share. Our senior credit facility and the indenture governing
our outstanding 8 7/8% senior subordinated notes
contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our
regular quarterly cash dividend in the future.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual
obligations at December 28, 2003:

During 2004, we expect to make capital
expenditures of approximately $40 million primarily to
introduce new products, to improve operating processes, to shift
the production capacity to lower cost locations and to reflect
investments in information technology. We expect to use our
available cash and internally generated funds to fund these
expenditures.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In January and December 2003, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No. 46 and No. 46, revised
(FIN 46R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

. These statements, which address accounting for
entities commonly known as special-purpose or off-balance-sheet
entities, require consolidation of certain interests or
arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial
interest in such entities. Certain provisions of FIN 46R
related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable
for the period ended December 31, 2003. We must apply
FIN 46R to our interests in all entities subject to the
interpretation as of the first interim or annual period ending
after March 15, 2004. We have considered the application of
FIN 46 and FIN46R to our investments, receivables
securitization program and other business relationships and
concluded that the adoption of this new method of accounting for
variable interest entities did not and is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated results of operations and
financial position.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible
assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other
post-retirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the
buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably
assured. For products that include installation, if the
installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate
element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and
recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the
installation is complete. For sales that include
customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized
only after the acceptance criteria have been met. Revenue from
services is deferred and recognized over the



contractual period or as services are rendered
and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple
elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate
revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria
for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

. Because
the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured
products or units rather than long-term customized projects, we
generally do not experience significant changes in original
estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant
product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that
require significant estimation.

Allowances for doubtful
accounts.

We maintain allowances for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We
generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by
(1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that
are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically
reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty.
Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful
accounts. This would reduce our earnings.

Inventory valuation.

We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or
manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain
that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its
recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below
cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in
excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory.
We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when
necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory
based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements or historical trailing usage of the
product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at
historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess
and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If
actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated,
inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in
lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than
expected in that period.

Value of long-lived assets, including
intangibles.

We carry a variety of
long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property and
equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of
these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market
values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We
undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets
such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and
(2) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when
facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from
those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we
record reduces our earnings. The 2002 initial assessment of
goodwill recoverability under SFAS No. 142 resulted in
a $117.8 million charge to our earnings. This charge,
relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our
Optoelectronics business segment, was caused by expected
declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness
in key end-markets. We completed the annual impairment tests of
goodwill for 2003 and concluded that there was no impairment.
While we believe that our estimates of current value are
reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future
cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve
could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges
against the carrying value of those assets. In addition, we
currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible
assets that are not being amortized at least annually to
determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an
indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that
the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer
indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in
accordance with SFAS 142. These intangible assets will then
be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful
life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible
assets that are subject to amortization.

Employee compensation and
benefits.

Retirement and post
retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing
business and represent obligations that will be ultimately
settled far in the future and therefore are subject to
estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the
recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s
approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and
the investment and funding decisions made by us. We are required
to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected
long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied
to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension
income or expense for the year. As of December 28, 2003, we
estimated the expected long-term



rate of return in the United States was 8.5%
percent, and ranged from 2.5% to 7.5% percent for our plans
outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return
on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable
based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the
overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as
well as our current expectations for long- term rates of returns
for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption
for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make
adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate
assumptions were based on the prevailing market long-term
interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our
assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also
change. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan
assets would increase pre-tax pension expense by
$2.2 million for 2004 in the United States and by
$0.6 million for 2004 for all plans outside the United
States. Retirement and post retirement benefit plan expense is
allocated to cost of sales, research and development and
selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated
statement of operations. We incurred expenses of
$6.2 million in 2003, $3.9 million in 2002 and
$2.4 million in 2001 for our retirement and post retirement
plans. We expect expenses of approximately $8.4 million in
2004 for our retirement and post retirement plans. We have
reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our
retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature. Under the
defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for
health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed
dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the health
care needs of that retiree. Our future liability therefore,
cannot be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care.

Restructuring
activities.

Our financial statements
detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as
well as the actual spending that has occurred against the
resulting accruals. Our restructuring charges are estimates
based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance
benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit
formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon
certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental
income, and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under
“Value of Long-Lived Assets, Including
Intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they
are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial
restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to
our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less
than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the
time at which they would be entitled to severance or if
anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be
less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes
or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual
obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes
in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial
statements on the income statement line entitled
“restructuring charges, net”.

Gains or losses on
dispositions.

When we record the
disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we
make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on
the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of
factors, including current interest in the market, alternative
markets for the assets and other relevant factors. If
anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount
of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated
proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the
asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected
contingencies when the transaction has been consummated.
Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first
estimated. During the year ended December 28, 2003, we
recognized $1.6 million in losses from the dispositions of
divested businesses classified as discontinued operations and
$2.7 million in gains from the disposition of assets,
comprised largely of excess facilities. The $1.6 million
included additional losses from the final disposition of our
Telecommunications Components and Entertainment Lighting
businesses as well as working capital adjustments related to the
sale of our Security and Detection business. These losses were
offset by gains from the resolution of contingencies associated
with the 1999 divestiture of the Technical Services business.
Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are
recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or
“discontinued operations” line items appearing in our
income statement.

Income taxes.

Our
business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to
taxes in more than 40 countries. Tax laws and tax rates vary
substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change
given the political and economic climate in those countries. We
report and pay income tax based on operational results and
applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates in
effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position.
Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws
could cause our estimates of



taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering
in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either
increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

In addition, we have established valuation
allowances against a variety of tax attributes, including net
operation loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits and other
credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration among
other things, limitations imposed upon the use of the tax
attributes and reduce the value of such items to the amount that
is deemed to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in
our operations, domestically and internationally could increase
our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The
release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax
attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate.

    About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risks

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us
to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts
receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of
credit risk as of December 28, 2003.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into
foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our
committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency
movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter-company
and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are
primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that
do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until
maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated
balance sheet. Credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange
instruments are contracted with major banking institutions.
Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts
are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as
fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related
unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other
comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the
period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs.
For the year ended December 28, 2003, we did not engage in
hedges designated as cash flow. The notional amount of the
outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately
$168.5 million at December 28, 2003 and
$103.0 million as of December 29, 2002, and the
approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative
contracts designated as fair value hedges was insignificant. The
duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts is
generally 30 day for 2003.

Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are
exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and
currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to
these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions
pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted
market exposures.

Foreign Exchange
Risk.

As a multinational corporation,
we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. These
exposures can take a variety of different forms:

(1) As our international sales grow,
    exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material
    impact on our financial results. Reported sales made in foreign
    currencies by our international subsidiaries, when translated
    into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, can
    fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. While exchange rate
    fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings, this
    impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not
    materially impact our short-term cash flows.

(2) In all parts of the world, our
    subsidiaries, on occasion, invoice third-party customers in
    foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do
    business. We refer to primary business currency as the
    “functional currencies.” Movements in the invoiced
    currency relative to the functional currency



We use foreign currency forward and option
contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The
derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not
held for trading purposes. We specifically use forward contracts
to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use
a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge
anticipated cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to
offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets,
liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.
The success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of
transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent that
these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of
currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency
gains or losses. The principal currencies hedged are the British
Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore
Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid,
cost-effective forward market, we maintain hedge coverage
between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our
anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one
year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in
the value of the related exposure.

Foreign Currency Risk —
Value-at-Risk Disclosure

—
We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential
earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency
related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to
minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our
Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo
simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding
period of 30 days. As of December 28, 2003, this
computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market
value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding
derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to
foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million.
This Value-at-Risk measure is consistent with our financial
statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging
program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters of
fiscal 2003, the Value-at-Risk ranged between $0.1 million
and $1.0 million, and averaged approximately
$0.5 million.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described above, our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate
and variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates
can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash
flows (as they relate to interest) and our earnings. In January
2004, we initiated, for a portion of our fixed rate debt
portfolio, interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate
debt to variable rate debt. These swaps have been designated as
fair value hedges. These swaps will be marked to market in our
consolidated financial statements so that fair value movements
in these swaps will be offset by the fair value movement in the
debt.

Interest Rate Risk —
Sensitivity

— As of
December 28, 2003, our debt portfolio is comprised of 55%
fixed rate debt and 45% variable rate debt. After giving effect
to the interest rate swap entered into in January 2004, 37% of
our debt portfolio is fixed and 63% is variable. Our current
debt covenants require that we



maintain at least 30% of our debt portfolio in
fixed rate debt as defined in the credit agreement. Our current
earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be
summarized as follows:

(1) changes in interest rates can cause
    interest charges on our variable rate debt comprised of
    $245 million of term loan and $100 million of swapped
    8 7/8% notes to fluctuate. A 10% increase or
    approximately 40 basis points in current interest rates
    would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our earnings of
    $1.4 million for fiscal year 2004.

(2) changes in interest rates can cause our
    cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt
    to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10% or
    approximately 40 basis points in current interest rates
    would cause our cash outflows to increase by $1.4 million
    for fiscal year 2004.

(3) changes in interest rates can cause the
    value of our fixed rate debt to change. However, such a value
    change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows
    unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open
    market.

Forward-Looking Information and Factors
Affecting Future Performance

The following important factors affect our
business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of
our business and operations:

Our operating results may continue to be
    harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries
    into which we sell our products.

Some of the industries and markets into which we
sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns are often
characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing
capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits.
Significant downturns in our customers’ markets and in
general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand
for several of our products and have hurt our operating results.
For example, during 2003, our operating results were adversely
affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve, including
the pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductor and aerospace
markets. Current economic conditions have caused a decrease in
capital spending by many of our customers, which in turn has
adversely affected our sales and business.

If we do not introduce new products in a
    timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our
    operating results would suffer.

We sell many of our products in industries
characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new
product and service introductions and evolving industry
standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and
enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete
over time, in which case our sales and operating results would
suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend
upon several factors, including our ability to:

Many of our products are used by our customers to
develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must
anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of
the commercialization of our customers’ products. In
developing new products, we may be required to make significant
investments before we can determine the commercial viability of
the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our
customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest
heavily in research and development of products that do not lead
to significant sales.



In addition, some of our licensed technology is
subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability
to develop or commercialize products for some applications. For
example, some of our license agreements are limited to the field
of life sciences research, and exclude clinical diagnostics
applications.

Our debt may adversely affect our cash flow
    and may restrict our investment opportunities.

As of December 28, 2003, we had
approximately $549.5 million in outstanding indebtedness,
excluding obligations under our accounts receivable
securitization facility.

Our level of indebtedness increases the
possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to
pay the principal or interest in respect of our indebtedness. We
have $100.0 million in additional borrowing capacity
available to us under our revolving credit facility. We may also
obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of
credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the
effect of increasing our total leverage.

Our leverage could have negative consequences,
including:

A significant portion of our indebtedness bears
interest at floating rates. As a result, our interest payment
obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates
increase.

Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to
reduce our total debt depends on our future operating
performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other
factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate
sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to
successfully execute our business strategy. If we are unable to
service our debt and fund our business, we may be forced to
reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional financing
or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt or sell
assets. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or
refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us
or at all.

Restrictions in our senior credit facility
    and the indenture governing our 8 7/8% notes may limit
    our activities.

Our senior credit facility and the indenture
relating to our 8 7/8% notes contain, and future debt
instruments to which we may become subject may contain,
restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in
activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including
restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries
to:



We are also required to meet specified financial
ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility. Our
ability to comply with these financial restrictions and
covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is
subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors,
including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign
exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and
changes in the level of competition.

Our failure to comply with any of these
restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default
under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit
acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to
prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an
acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would
trigger an event of default under our 8 7/8% notes,
and a default under our 8 7/8% notes would trigger an
event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly
other debt.

If an event of default occurs, we may not have
sufficient funds available to make the required payments under
our indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under
our senior credit facility, those lenders may be entitled to
foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings
under that agreement. Our inability to repay amounts owed under
our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other
of our obligations including our accounts receivable
securitization facility.

Economic, political and other risks
    associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our
    international sales.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our
businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States
represented more than 50% of our total sales in the fiscal year
ended December 28, 2003. We anticipate that sales from
international operations will continue to represent a
substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our
manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located
outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could
be harmed by a variety of factors, including:



Our quarterly operating results are subject
    to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our
    operations to effectively address changes we do not
    anticipate.

Given the nature of the markets in which we
participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and
profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic
conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we can
offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to
make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high
proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our
significant sales, research and development and manufacturing
costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately
affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may
affect our quarterly operating results include:

We may not be able to successfully execute
    acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired
    businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business
    or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies
    profitable.

We have in the past, and may in the future,
supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and
licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing
product lines, such as our acquisition of Packard BioScience
Company in November 2001. We may be unable to identify or
complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many
reasons, including:

Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may
be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the
earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our
earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable
levels of profitability, we must improve their management,
operations, products and market penetration. We may not be
successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties
in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise
additional funds, either through public or private financings.
We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so
only on terms unacceptable to us.



If we do not successfully integrate our
    Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, we may
    not achieve the benefits we anticipate we will derive from the
    combination of these businesses.

In 2003, we achieved in excess of the original
range of $12 to $25 million in pre-tax cost savings from
the combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments
businesses, announced in the fourth quarter of 2002. In 2004, we
are targeting additional pre-tax cost savings of between
$5.0 million and $20.0 million, for a combined pre-tax
cost savings of between $30.0 million and
$45.0 million relative to fiscal 2002 cost levels. While we
believe these cost savings to be reasonable, they are estimates
that are inherently difficult to predict, are necessarily
speculative in nature and are subject to various integration
risks. The integration risks include the possibility that we may
experience a loss of productivity, sales and key personnel and
that the information technology systems of these two businesses
may not be fully compatible. If any of the potential
difficulties were to occur and persist, the business results of
our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment could suffer.
In addition, unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the
estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration.

As a result of these integration risks and
possible unforeseen factors, our actual cost savings, if any,
could differ or be delayed, compared to our estimates. Moreover,
our capability to more fully capitalize, through their
combination, on the strengths of our former Life Sciences and
Analytical Instruments businesses’ sales, service and
research and development organizations may be compromised.

Our loss of licenses may require us to stop
    selling products or lose competitive advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses
or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to
us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other
proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products
incorporating that technology and possibly other products,
redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential
competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to
license and potentially erode our market share.

Our licenses typically subject us to various
economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply
with these obligations we could lose important rights under a
license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some
cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition,
rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out
of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent
protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the
licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that
curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our
    business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous
competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to
compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain
competitive, we must develop new products and periodically
enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also
have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay
competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or
market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of
entire product lines.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory
    compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and
    Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be
    forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and
    distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal
    penalties.

Some of the products produced by our Life and
Analytical Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by
the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar
international agencies. In addition, some of the activities of
our Fluid Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by
the United States Federal Aviation Administration. These
regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from
design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion,
sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those
regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may
have to recall products and cease their manufacture and
distribution. In addition, we could be subject to fines or
criminal prosecution.



Changes in governmental regulations may
    reduce demand for our products or increase our
    expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our
customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign
regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food
and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our
products to meet customer needs created by these regulations.
Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand
for our products or increase our costs of producing these
products.

Obtaining and enforcing patent protection
    for our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be
    difficult and expensive; we may infringe intellectual property
    rights of third parties.

Patent and trade secret protection is important
to us because developing and marketing new technologies and
products is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United
States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional
patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents
from any pending or future patent applications owned by or
licensed to us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may
not be broad enough to protect our technology.

Third parties may seek to challenge,
    invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to
    us or claim that our products and operations infringe their
    patent or other intellectual property rights.

In addition to our patents, we possess an array
of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and we license
intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The
measures that we employ to protect this technology and these
rights may not be adequate. Moreover, in some cases, the
licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a
non-exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified
performance targets.

We may incur significant expense in any legal
proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend
infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of
third parties against us could result in awards of substantial
damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from
manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the
United States or abroad.

Our results of operations will be adversely
    affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible
    assets.

As of December 28, 2003, our total assets
included $1.5 billion of net intangible assets. Net
intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated
with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent
rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of
accumulated amortization. These assets have historically been
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives. In connection with our adoption of
SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in
fiscal 2002. Instead, we test these items, at a minimum, on an
annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying
value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which
they are assigned.

Future impairment testing may result in
additional intangible asset write-offs, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

Financial Statements and Supplemental
    Data




INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
PerkinElmer, Inc.

Wellesley, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of December 28, 2003 and December 29,
2002, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 28, 2003. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 28, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 to conform
to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1:     Nature
of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of
Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is
a global high technology company which designs, manufactures,
markets and supports products, systems and service offerings
within three reporting segments: Life and Analytical Sciences,
Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
Company). All material intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Policies and
Estimates:

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its
estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Sales:

The
Company’s product sales are recorded when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the
price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility
is reasonably assured. For products that include installation,
and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a
separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery,
and installation revenue is recognized when the installation is
complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance
criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria
have been met. Certain of the Company’s products require
specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred
until installation is completed. Revenue from services is
deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as
services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When
arrangements include multiple elements, the Company uses
objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the
elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue
recognition have been met for each element. Shipping and
handling costs are reflected in both revenue and cost of goods
sold to the extent they are billed to customers. In all other
instances they are reflected as a component of cost of goods
sold.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

EITF Issue
No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The
provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 apply to revenue
arrangements entered into in the third quarter of 2003 and
thereafter. On December 17, 2003, the Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104),

Revenue
Recognition

, which supersedes SAB 101,

Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.

SAB 104’s
primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in
SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements,
superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF No. 00-21.
The adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 and SAB 104 did
not have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial condition.

Inventories:

Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing
overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Substantially all inventories are accounted for using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of determining inventory
costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

where necessary, provisions for excess and
obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the
Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements.

Income Taxes:

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the
recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss
carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits
is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is
established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is
not more likely than not. Pursuant to Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for Income
Taxes — Special Areas

(APB 23) and related
interpretations with respect to corporate earnings permanently
reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax for the
repatriation of its foreign earnings that it considers to be
permanently reinvested outside the United States.

Property, Plant and
Equipment:

For financial statement
purposes, the Company depreciates plant and equipment using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which
generally fall within the following ranges:
buildings — 10 to 40 years; leasehold
improvements — estimated useful life or remaining term
of lease, whichever is shorter; machinery and
equipment — 3 to 7 years. Certain tooling costs
are capitalized and amortized over a 3 year life, while
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Pension Plans:

The
Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the
U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum
funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not
fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds. A
minimum pension liability adjustment is recorded when the
actuarial present value of accumulated benefits exceeds plan
assets and accrued pension liabilities.

Translation of Foreign
Currencies:

For foreign operations
with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange
rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average
exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as
gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
component of stockholders’ equity.

Intangible Assets:

The Company’s intangible assets consist of
(1) goodwill, which is not being amortized commencing in
2002 and beyond; (2) indefinite lived intangibles, which
consist of certain trademarks and trade names that are not
subject to amortization; and (3) amortizing intangibles,
which consist of patents, and purchased technologies, which are
being amortized over their useful lives. All intangible assets
are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis.

Note 12 describes the impact of accounting
for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

,
and the annual impairment methodology that the Company employs
on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal
year in calculating the recoverability of goodwill. This same
impairment test will be performed at other times during the
course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the
recoverability of goodwill should be challenged. Non-amortizing
intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The
impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of
the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying
amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is
recognized

.

Amortizing intangibles are currently evaluated
for impairment using the methodology set forth in
SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS No. 144).
Recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have
occurred that may give rise to an impairment. When a potential
impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash
flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared
to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present
in that



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operation. If such cash flows are less than such
carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles,
are written down to their respective fair values.

Prior to 2002, the Company employed the
impairment methodologies set forth in SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.

These methodologies did
not differ substantially from SFAS No. 144 as they
related to amortizing intangibles. Goodwill was also previously
evaluated for impairment under SFAS No. 121 in 2001.

Stock-Based
Compensation:

At December 28,
2003, the Company has three stock-based compensation plans,
which are described more fully in Note 19. The Company
accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,

and related interpretations. As allowed
by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation,

no stock-based employee compensation cost
related to stock options is reflected in net income, as all
options granted under those plans had an exercise price at least
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. The Company has also issued restricted stock to
certain employees and has reflected the intrinsic value of these
awards as unearned compensation until the restrictions are
released and the compensation is earned. The Company has elected
to account for disclosure of the effects of fair value
accounting on net income and earnings per share on a pro forma
basis which is presented below. The following table illustrates
the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123.

Marketable Securities and
Investments:

Marketable Securities and
Investments, whether debt or equity, are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

The cost
of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method. Should securities be classified as available for sale,
the Company records these investments at their fair values with
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss). Under the cost method of
accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried
at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines
in fair value or additional investments.

Investments in business entities in which the
Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies, are
accounted for by the equity method.

Cash Flows:

For
purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted instruments
with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities.

Environmental
Matters:

The Company accrues for costs
associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been
discounted.

Comprehensive Income
(Loss):

Comprehensive income (loss) is
defined as net income or loss and other changes in
stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events
from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive income
(loss) is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging:

The Company records
derivative instruments on the balance sheet as assets or
liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting
from changes in the values of those derivatives would be
accounted for depending on the use of the derivative instrument
and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.

Reclassifications:

Certain financial statement amounts from prior years have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In January and December 2003, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46) and No. 46,
revised (FIN 46R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.

These statements, which address accounting for
entities commonly known as special-purpose or off-balance-sheet
entities, require consolidation of certain interests or
arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial
interest in such entities. Certain provisions of FIN 46R
related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable
for the period ended December 31, 2003. The Company must
apply FIN 46R to its interests in all entities subject to
the interpretation as of the first interim or annual period
ending after March 15, 2004. The Company has considered the
application of FIN 46 and FIN46R to its investments,
receivables securitization program and other business
relationships and concluded that the adoption of this new method
of accounting for variable interest entities did not and is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Note 2:     Acquisitions
and Divestitures

Acquisitions

Packard

In November 2001, the Company completed its
acquisition of Packard BioScience Company (Packard) for a
purchase price of approximately $764 million, primarily in
the form of approximately 22 million shares of the
Company’s common stock and the assumption of approximately
$118.2 million in debt that the Company subsequently
redeemed in March 2002. The reason for the acquisition, and the
primary factors that contributed to the purchase price that
resulted in the recognition of goodwill, are that the
acquisition extended the Company’s capabilities in high
throughput screening, automated liquid handling and sample
preparation and strengthened its position as a global provider
of comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions.

The Company, assisted by valuation consultants,
performed an assessment of intangible assets using valuation
techniques including discounted cash flow and other income
approach analyses. Acquired intangible assets valued at
$239.2 million included the fair value of trade names,
trademarks, patents and developed technology. Of this amount,
$76.5 million has been ascribed to trade names and
trademarks for which an indefinite life has been assigned. The
remaining $162.7 million of acquired intangible assets
include core technology of $36.7 million (10-year
weighted-average useful life), completed technology of
$73.0 million (10-year weighted-average useful life), and
patents of $53.0 million (10-year weighted-average useful
life). The Packard acquisition also resulted in an allocation to
goodwill of $428.9 million that was assigned to the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment.
Of that total amount, $117.9 million is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. Indefinite lived intangibles and
goodwill are not being amortized in accordance with
SFAS No. 142.

The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
in accordance with SFAS No. 141, and the Company has
accordingly allocated the purchase price of Packard based upon
the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Some allocations are based on studies and independent
valuations, as discussed above. The components of the initial
purchase price and allocation are as follows (in thousands):

Initial liabilities assumed included integration
charges. These are described in greater detail under the
integration activity caption below.

Packard’s operations, assumed as of the date
of acquisition, are reported within the results of operations of
the Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment.

Integration
activity

The Company has undertaken integration actions in
connection with acquired businesses. These activities, which
were accounted for in accordance with EITF 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Business Combination,

have primarily included employee
separation costs, the abandonment of excess facilities and the
termination of leases and other contractual obligations. In
connection with these integration activities, as part of the
cost of acquisitions, the Company established reserves as
detailed below. All changes in estimates within one year of the
integration plan inception have been recorded as an adjustment
of the cost of the acquired company as a change in goodwill. Any
incremental charges incurred more than twelve months after the
commencement of the integration activities are charged to the
income statement as restructuring activities. Any incremental
credits were reversed against the existing goodwill balance.

The Packard integration plans included
initiatives to integrate the operations of Packard. These
integration costs principally included amounts related to
employee separation costs for approximately 200 individuals and
the termination of leases and other contractual obligations. In
connection with the Packard acquisition, the Company initially
recorded $33 million for integration charges. In the fourth
quarter of 2002, the Company finalized its severance costs and
determined that its estimates were too high principally due to
actual severance costs per employee being lower than planned. As
a result, the Company reversed $11.9 million of severance
costs in the integration accrual in the fourth quarter of 2002
with the offsetting



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amount recorded in goodwill. The Company also
reversed $4.0 million related to the termination of leases
and other contractual obligations in the fourth quarter of 2002
due to changes in estimates, with the offsetting amount recorded
to goodwill. The total reversal in the fourth quarter of 2002
was $15.9 million. Therefore, the net integration charge
related to the Company’s purchase of Packard totaled
$17.1 million. The integration activities were completed in
early 2003 with the exception of $0.9 million of remaining
payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be
paid through 2004.

The following table summarizes integration
reserve activity during 2003, 2002 and 2001 related to the
acquisition of Packard:

In July 2000, the Company completed its
acquisition of NEN Life Sciences, Inc. (NEN), a provider of
state-of-the-art drug discovery products, services, reagents and
technologies to the life sciences industry. In connection with
the acquisition, the Company recorded a $4.0 million
integration reserve related to the acquisition of NEN. The NEN
restructuring plan included approximately $3.8 million in
termination and employment related costs of individuals
principally based in NEN’s headquarters and operations
center ($3.4 million remained as of the end of fiscal year
2000) and $.2 million of lease termination costs. These
integration activities occurred concurrently with the Company
restructuring activities in 2000 (see Note 3).

The following table summarizes integration
reserve activity during 2001 related to the acquisition of NEN:

In May 1999, the Company completed its
acquisition of the Analytical Instruments Division (AI) of
Perkin-Elmer Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $425 million, plus acquisition costs. As part
of the AI acquisition, the Company incurred integration charges
to merge the AI business with its existing business. The AI
integration plan included initiatives to integrate the
operations of the acquired businesses, and reduce overhead. The
primary components of these plans related to: (a) employee
termination benefits and related costs for approximately 600
individuals, (b) consolidation or shutdown of certain
operational facilities worldwide, and (c) termination of
certain leases and other contractual obligations. The
integration activities were completed in 2002.

Gains on dispositions in 2003 included
$2.2 million from sale of facilities and $0.5 million
from the final resolution of contingencies related to the 2001
sale of the Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences (IRAS)
business.

Gains on dispositions in 2002 included
$4.4 million from the sale of facilities and approximately
$0.8 million from the resolution of certain contingencies
related to the sale of the IRAS business.

During 2001, the Company sold its IRAS business
for cash of $55.5 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of
approximately $32.3 million. Also during 2001, the Company
sold its Voltarc business for cash of $9.5 million and a
note for approximately $8.0 million, resulting in a pre-tax
loss of approximately $6.3 million. In addition, the
Company sold small businesses resulting in a loss of
$7.2 million. The combined net income of the disposed
businesses was $5.4 million in 2000 and $1.4 million
in 2001 through the date of disposal.

All of the gains described above are reported in
gains on dispositions, net in the consolidated income statements.

Note 3:     Restructuring
Charges

The Company has undertaken four separate
restructuring actions over the past three years. Restructuring
actions in 2001 and 2002 were recorded in accordance with
EITF 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

(EITF 94-03). Restructuring actions taken in 2003 were
recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

(SFAS 146).

A description of each of the four restructuring
plans is as follows:

Q2 2003
Plan:

During 2003, the Company incurred a
$2.0 million restructuring charge in the Life and
Analytical Sciences business and a $0.3 million
restructuring charge in the Optoelectronics business. The
purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance
and take advantage of synergies between the Company’s
former Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses. The
principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower
headcount due to the continued integration of Life and
Analytical Sciences business in a European manufacturing
facility and a customer care center as well as a headcount
reduction at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities
to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

This restructuring charge was primarily recorded
in the second quarter, but additional charges were recorded in
the third and fourth quarters as required by SFAS 146, as
people were notified in the second quarter but were required to
work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance. In
addition, the Company recorded a restructuring reversal of
$0.4 million due to higher than expected employee attrition
rates prior to ultimate termination and, accordingly, lower
severance costs. The following table summarizes the 2003
restructuring plan activity for the year ended December 28,
2003:

Actions under the plan were completed by
December 28, 2003 with the exception of nine headcount
reductions that will be completed by the second quarter of 2004.

Q4 2002
Plan

In connection with the Company’s decision to
combine the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses
in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies,
the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of
$26.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 (the Q4
2002 Plan). This plan allowed the Company to combine many
business functions worldwide, with the intention to better serve
its customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the
businesses’ sales, service and research and development
organizations. The principal actions in the restructuring plan
included workforce reductions, closure of facilities and
disposal of underutilized assets. The following table summarizes
the components of the Company’s Q4 2002 Plan and related
accrual activity:

This restructuring resulted in the integration of
U.S. Life and Analytical Sciences sales, service and
customer care centers, the integration of European customer care
and finance centers, the merging of a former Life Sciences
European manufacturing facility with a former Analytical
Instruments European manufacturing facility and the merging of a
portion of a former Life Science research and development
European facility with a former Analytical Instruments European
facility.

During 2003, the Company expended
$13.8 million to execute these actions. In addition, the
Company recorded a reversal of $6.2 million in the Q4 2002
Plan due to higher than expected employee attrition rates in
several countries prior to ultimate termination, and accordingly
lower severance costs, plus lower than expected lease
termination costs in certain locations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The remaining liability represents severance and
lease commitments. The Company expects to settle the remaining
severance liability by the second quarter of 2004. The lease
commitments on unoccupied buildings extend until 2005.

Q1 2002
Plan

During the first quarter of 2002, the
Company’s management developed a plan to restructure
several businesses within its Life and Analytical Sciences and
Optoelectronics segments. The plan resulted in pre-tax
restructuring charges totaling $9.2 million. The principal
actions in the restructuring plan included workforce and
overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities,
including the closure of a manufacturing facility, disposal of
underutilized assets and general cost reductions. The following
table summarizes the components of the Company’s Q1 2002
Plan and related accrual activity:

Q1 2002 Plan charges in the Company’s Life
and Analytical Sciences segment totaled $5.5 million. The
charges were a result of softness in components of the Life and
Analytical Sciences business. Actions under the charges
primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing
location and the streamlining of the global sales and research
and development organizations, primarily in Europe, Japan and
the Pacific Rim. These actions were undertaken to reduce the
number of employees in components of its business that had
experienced declining demand. The Q1 2002 Plan charges in the
Company’s Optoelectronics segment totaled
$3.7 million. This charge was primarily due to the removal
of a layer of management structure within Optoelectronics that
led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure.
Planned headcount reductions for Q1 2002 Plan totaled 276.

During 2003, the Company recorded a reversal of
$1.0 million in the Q1 2002 Plan due to lower than expected
headcount reductions and severance costs resulting from higher
than expected attrition rates in several countries prior to
ultimate termination.

Q4 2001
Plan:

During the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection
with the integration of Packard and a restructuring of its sales
offices in Europe, the Company recorded a restructuring charge
of $9.2 million in the Life and Analytical Sciences
segment. The principal actions in the restructuring plan include
the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and
services offices in Europe, as well as costs associated with the
closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe, the closure of
leased manufacturing facilities in the United States and the
disposal of related assets. These actions were designed to
streamline the organization and take advantage of the synergies
offered by the Packard acquisition as they relate to the legacy
Life and Analytical Science segment. The total planned number of
employees to be terminated was 272.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes the original
restructuring charge and subsequent activity of the
Company’s Q4 2001 Plan:

The remaining liability relates to European
severance obligations and will be paid in 2004.

In 2003, an additional pre-tax restructuring
charge associated with the Q4 2001 Plan of
$1.8 million was recorded. This charge was primarily due to
additional severance and severance related benefits of the
previously identified employees associated with the closure of a
European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical
Sciences segment and will be paid in 2004.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences and
carryovers that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and
liabilities as of December 28, 2003 and December 29,
2002 were as follows:

At December 28, 2003, the Company had net
operating loss carryovers of approximately $87 million,
research and development credits totaling $10 million and
foreign tax credits of $12 million, subject to various
carryforward periods. Based on the judgment of the Company, full
valuation allowances have been established against a variety of
tax attribute items. Valuation allowances take into
consideration limitations imposed upon the use of the tax
attribute carryovers and reduce the value of such items to the
likely net realizable amount.

Current deferred tax assets of $53 million and
$103 million were included in other current assets at
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.
Long-term deferred tax assets of $5 million were included in
other assets at December 28, 2003. Long-term deferred tax
liabilities of $67 million and $112 million were included
in other long-term liabilities at December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, respectively. The decrease in current
deferred tax assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities in
2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to an adjustment in
the characterization of the current deferred tax assets and
long-term deferred tax liabilities.

With the exception of deferred taxes specifically
provided on earnings anticipated to be repatriated and dividends
actually paid to the U.S., the Company does not provide for
taxes on unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. It is
the practice and intention of the Company to permanently
reinvest the income of its foreign subsidiaries in its overseas
operations. However, certain requirements of the senior secured
credit facility discussed in Note 14 may require the
Company to repatriate earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries
in the future. Consistent with past practice, the Company will
include in its income tax provision the incremental tax cost, if
any, for earnings to be repatriated to the U.S. to satisfy
debt and other obligations when such events become foreseeable.

Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 23,

Accounting for Income Taxes — Special
Areas

(APB 23) and related interpretations with respect
to corporate earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the
Company does not accrue tax for the repatriation of its foreign
earnings that it considers to be permanently



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reinvested outside the United States. As of
December 28, 2003, the amount of earnings for which no
repatriation tax cost provision has been provided was
approximately $426 million.

Note 6:     Discontinued
Operations

During 2003, the Company settled various claims
under certain long-term contracts and transition services with
its Technical Services business, which was sold in August of
1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously
established contingency reserves resulted in a pre-tax gain of
$6.5 million that was recognized in 2003, included in gain
(loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations.

In June 2002, the Company completed the sale of
its Security and Detection Systems business for cash
consideration of approximately $100.0 million and a net
working capital adjustment, the amount of which has yet to be
finalized. A net pre-tax gain of approximately
$15.0 million was recorded pursuant to this transaction in
2002 as a gain on the disposition of a discontinued operation.
Adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of
$2.4 million in 2003, primarily due to revised estimates of
the working capital adjustment. The Company has accounted for
its Security and Detection Systems business as a discontinued
operation in accordance with APB No. 30, and accordingly,
the results of operations and related cash flows of this
business through the disposal date have been segregated from
continuing operations and reported as a separate line on the
Company’s Consolidated Income Statements. The loss in 2003
and the gain in 2002 are presented as a component of net income
within dispositions of discontinued operations, net of income
tax in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement.

During June 2002, the Company approved separate
plans to shut down its Telecommunications Component and sell its
Entertainment Lighting businesses as part of its continued
efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. This resulted
in an initial pre-tax loss of approximately $20.5 million
in 2002. In June 2003, the Company completed the sale of a
significant portion of its Entertainment Lighting business and
abandoned the remaining assets. In addition, the Company
incurred adjustments relating to the shut down of its
Telecommunications business. Accordingly, a pre-tax loss of
$4.3 million was recorded in 2003. The results of these
businesses were previously reported as part of the
Optoelectronics reporting segment. The Company has accounted for
these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, has
presented the results of operations and related cash flows of
these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods
presented. The assets and liabilities of these disposal groups
have been presented separately and are reflected within the
assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 29,
2002.

The Company recorded the following gains and
losses, which have been reported as the loss on dispositions of
discontinued operations during the years ended December 28,
2003 and December 29, 2002:

For the year ended December 30, 2001, the
amount recorded as gain on dispositions of discontinued
operations, totaling $2,367, was attributable to the 1999 sale
of the Technical Services business. The amounts



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recognized as gains reflect the resolution of
contingencies recorded on certain long-term contracts and
transitional services provided to the Technical Services
business subsequent to the sale.

Summary operating results of the discontinued
operations of the Security and Detection Systems,
Telecommunications Component and Entertainment Lighting
businesses for the periods prior to disposition were as follows:

Note 7:     Earnings
per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing
net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the year less restricted unvested shares.
Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus
the dilutive effects of common shares issuable upon the exercise
of stock options using the treasury stock method and the release
of restrictions on restricted stock awards. The following table
reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per
share calculations:

Shares of common stock related to employee stock
options to purchase 8.3 million, 15.5 million and
8.0 million shares of common stock were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share for 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, because their effect would have been
antidilutive. Additionally, warrants to purchase
0.6 million shares of common stock were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share in 2003, 2002 and 2001
because their effect would have been antidilutive. Conversion of
the Company’s zero coupon debentures was not assumed in the
computation of diluted earnings per share for the years
presented because the effect of assumed conversion would have
been antidilutive for all periods presented.

Note 8:     Accounts
Receivable

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for
doubtful accounts of $20.2 million and $21.4 million
as of December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002,
respectively.

During 2001, the Company established a wholly
owned consolidated subsidiary to fund, on a revolving basis,
certain of the Company’s accounts receivable balances and
simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of
receivables to a financial institution. As collections reduce
the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are
sold. The Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the
risk of credit loss on the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the
allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on the
Company’s balance sheet. Under the terms of this
arrangement, the Company retains collection and administrative
responsibilities for the balances. The servicing fees received
constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No
servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The accounts
receivable securitization facility provides for up to
$65.0 million in accounts receivable funding. The facility
had an effective interest rate at December 28, 2003 of
approximately LIBOR plus 120 basis points. Amounts funded
under this facility were $45 million and $29.0 million
at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002,
respectively. Amounts funded reduce the outstanding receivable
balance. The facility includes conditions that require the
Company to maintain a corporate credit rating of BB or above as
defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and
Ba2 or above as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At
December 28, 2003 the Company had a senior unsecured credit
rating of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services and of Ba2 with a stable outlook
from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2004, the
Company entered into an agreement to extend the term of its
accounts receivable securitization facility to January 28,
2005.

Note 12:     Goodwill
and Intangible Assets

In connection with adopting FAS 142 in
fiscal 2002, the Company, assisted by valuation consultants,
completed the transitional testing of goodwill using a
measurement date of January 1, 2002. The results of the
transitional testing indicated that the carrying values of the
lighting reporting unit within the Optoelectronics reporting
segment exceeded the estimated fair value of this unit as
determined utilizing various valuation techniques, including
discounted cash flow and comparative market analysis.
Accordingly, an impairment charge was recognized as a change in
accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The impairment
charge was $117.8 million on a before and after-tax basis.
The Company performs its annual goodwill assessment on the later
of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. The
Company completed its annual impairment tests for the year
ending December 28, 2003 as required by FAS 142 and
determined that there was no impairment of goodwill for fiscal
2003.

Note 13:     In-Process
Research and Development

In-process research and development expenses for
2001 were $71.5 million and consisted primarily of
in-process research and development expenses related
specifically to projects the Company acquired in connection with
the purchase of Packard within the Company’s Life and
Analytical Sciences reporting segment. These projects were
valued based on discounted probable future cash flows on a
project-by-project basis. The Company prepared revenue and
expense projections as well as technology assumptions through
2008. The Company discounted the projected cash flows using
interest rates specific to each project derived



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

from a cost of capital adjusted upward for the
stage of completion. These adjusted discount rates ranged
between 20-37% based upon the remaining effort and risk of
completion. The efforts required to develop the in-process
technologies into commercially viable products principally
relate to the completion of planning, designing, prototyping,
verification and testing activities that were necessary to
establish that the products could be designed to meet their
design specifications, including function, features and
technical performance requirements. Failure to complete any of
these projects has not had and would not have a material adverse
impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or
cash flows.

The Company classified Packard acquisition
projects for which the charge is associated as follows:

Note 14:     Debt

Senior Secured Credit
Facility.

In December 2002, the
Company entered into a senior credit facility. This facility was
originally comprised of a six-year term loan in the amount of
$315.0 million and a $100.0 million five-year
revolving credit facility. This credit facility is secured
primarily by a substantial portion of the Company’s and its
subsidiaries’ domestic assets. In 2003, $70 million of
principal payments were made on the term loan. Accordingly, at
December 28, 2003 $245 million was outstanding on the
term loan with no outstanding principal balance under the
revolving credit facility at year end or at any point during the
year.

The Company has amended this facility three
times. While the first and second amendments were
administrative, the third, executed in December 2003, amended
the senior credit facility to reduce the interest rate margin
paid on the term loan as well to amend several restrictive
covenants. Interest rates under the amended senior credit
facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit
facility are determined as



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a margin over either the Eurodollar rate or the
base rate. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate
base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A.
and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points.
The applicable margin for the term loan was amended to
225 basis points for the Eurodollar rate, from the original
400 basis points, and 125 basis points for the base
rate, from the original 300 basis points. The applicable
margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary
based upon the Company’s leverage ratio at the end of the
prior quarter. Should the Company achieve a leverage ratio below
2.5 times, its applicable margin for the term loan will
decrease to 200 basis points over the Euro rate or
100 basis points over the base rate. All or a portion of
indebtedness under the senior credit facility may be based upon
the margin over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At
December 28, 2003, the Eurodollar rate was approximately
114 basis points and the base rate was 400 basis
points. The term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal
quarterly installments of $0.8 million until December 2007,
and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of 25% of
the then outstanding indebtedness until December 2008. The
revolving credit facility is available to the Company through
December 2007 for working capital needs.

The senior credit facility contains covenants
requiring specific financial ratios, including:

8 7/8% Notes.

In December 2002, the Company issued and sold ten-year senior
subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of
$300.0 million and received $297.5 million in gross
proceeds from the issuance. The debt, which matures in January
2013, is unsecured, but the Company’s payment obligations
under the 8 7/8% Notes are guaranteed by some of the
Company’s domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantor
Subsidiaries”), all of which are wholly owned by the
Company. Such guarantees are full and unconditional and joint
and several.

Interest on the 8 7/8% Notes is payable
semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th. If a
change of control occurs, each holder of 8 7/8% Notes
may require the Company to repurchase some or all of its notes
at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
notes, plus accrued interest. Before January 15, 2006, the
Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Company’s 8 7/8% Notes with the net
proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108.875% of the
principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains
outstanding after the redemption. The Company may redeem some or
all of its 8 7/8% Notes at any time on or after
January 15, 2008, at a redemption price of 104.438%. The
redemption price decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009,
to 101.479% on January 15, 2010 and to 100% on
January 15, 2011. The debt is subordinated to the
Company’s new senior credit facility and other existing and
future senior indebtedness. The Company’s
8 7/8% Notes contain financial and other covenants.
Most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an
investment grade rating by Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services and Moody’s Investors Service.

In January 2004, the fixed rate on
$100 million of these notes was swapped to a floating rate
using swap instruments which reset semi-annually in arrears
based upon six-month USD LIBOR. These swaps have been designated
as fair value hedges.

Zero Coupon Convertible
Debentures.

Through the first quarter
of 2003, the Company repurchased $344.7 million in accreted
amount of its zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in
open market purchases and through a December 2002 tender offer.
The remaining $157.4 million of accreted value of zero
coupon debentures was redeemed on August 7, 2003 in
accordance with their terms. The Company used approximately
$155.0 million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of its
senior secured credit facility along with available cash of
approximately $2.4 million, to redeem the zero coupon
convertible debentures. As such, as of December 28, 2003,
the zero coupon convertible debentures have been fully retired.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

6.8% Notes.

In
December 2002, the Company initiated a tender offer for all of
its outstanding 6.8% unsecured notes. The Company completed the
tender offer and repurchased all but $4.7 million of these
notes. The Company paid consent payments pursuant to a consent
solicitation it made concurrently with the tender offer. The
consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the
restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the
6.8% notes. The Company may from time to time repurchase
outstanding 6.8% Notes through open market purchases,

Note 16:     Employee
Benefit Plans

Savings Plan:

The
Company has a savings plan for the benefit of qualified United
States employees. Under this plan, for Life and Analytical
Sciences and corporate employees, the Company contributes an
amount equal to the lesser of 100% of the employee’s
voluntary contribution or 5.0% of the employee’s annual
compensation. For Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences employees,
the Company contributes an amount equal to the lesser of 55% of
the amount of the employee’s voluntary contribution or 3.3%
of the employee’s annual compensation. Savings plan expense
was $8.0 million in 2003, $7.3 million in 2002 and
$6.5 million in 2001.

Pension Plans:

The
Company has defined benefit pension plans covering some United
States employees and non-U.S. pension plans for some
non-U.S. employees. The principal United States defined
benefit pension plans were closed to new hires effective
January 31, 2001 and benefits for those employed by the
Company’s former Life Sciences businesses within the
Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment
were frozen as of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of
March 2003 for those employed by the Company’s former
Analytical Instruments business within its Life and Analytical
Sciences reporting segment and corporate employees. The plans
provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of
service and compensation near retirement.

in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also sponsors a supplemental
executive retirement plan to provide senior management with
benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective
July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, the projected
benefit obligations were $16.8 million and
$16.6 million, respectively. Assets with a fair value of
$4.7 million and $5.4 million, segregated in a trust,
were available to meet this obligation as of December 28,
2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively. Pension expense
for this plan was approximately $1.5 million in 2003,
$1.6 million in 2002 and $1.1 million in 2001.

An additional minimum liability of
$9.1 million and $3.9 million was recorded to
stockholder’s equity during 2003 and 2002 as a result of
the fair value of the plan assets for the Company’s pension
plan in the

United Kingdom being below the accumulated
benefit obligation of the same plan. Unrecognized net losses are
amortized over the remaining service period in accordance with
accounting regulations.

Assets of the defined benefit pension plans are
primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocation at
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and target
asset allocations for fiscal 2004, are as follows:

The Company maintains target allocation
percentages among various asset classes based on investment
policies established for the pension plans which are designed to
maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation)
after inflation within the limits of prudent risk taking, while
providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments.
The Company’s expected returns on assets assumptions are
derived from studies conducted by actuaries and investment
advisors. The studies include a review of anticipated future
long-term performance of individual asset classes and
consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given
the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the
average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to
provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives
appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and
historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term,
prospective rate.

The Company does not expect to make any
contributions to the U.S. plan during fiscal 2004. With
respect to non-U.S. plans, the Company will make
contributions as required by local pension funding laws.

Postretirement Medical
Plans:

The Company provides health
care benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a
comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance
organizations where available. The majority of the
Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree
health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and
have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical
plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a
deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other
group coverages and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree
contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for
cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan
was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the
Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on
employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount
allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined
benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity
and debt securities.

Net periodic post-retirement medical benefit cost
(credit) included the following components:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table sets forth the changes in the
postretirement medical plan’s funded status and the amounts
recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002.

*

In 2001, the Company moved entirely to a defined
    dollar plan. Accordingly, such assumptions are no longer
    applicable.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The accrued postretirement medical liability
included $3.2 million and $3.0 million classified as
long-term liabilities as of December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, respectively.

The Company maintains a Master Trust for plan
assets related to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the
U.S. postretirement medical plan. Accordingly, investment
policies, target asset allocations and actual asset allocations
are the same as those disclosed for the U.S. defined
benefit plans.

The Company does not expect to make any
contributions to the postretirement medical plan during 2004.

Deferred Compensation
Plans:

During 1998, the Company
implemented certain nonqualified deferred compensation programs
that provide benefits payable to officers and certain key
employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future
dates, or upon retirement or death. Benefit payments under these
plans are funded by a combination of contributions from
participants and the Company. The Company has not made any cash
contributions to this plan since inception. The obligations
related to the deferred compensation plan totaled
$3.8 million and $4.3 million at December 28,
2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.

Note 17:     Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters
that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities.
Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and
it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved
unfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals
for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable.
Management believes that any liability that may ultimately
result from the resolution of these matters in excess of amounts
provided will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the
Company.

In addition, the Company is conducting a number
of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current
and former Company locations and, along with other companies,
has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain
waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental
issues in the accounting period that the Company’s
responsibility is established and when the cost can be
reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $6.2 million
as of December 28, 2003, representing management’s
estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known
environmental matters. Such amount is not discounted and does
not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or
indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject
to a number of variables, including the stage of the
environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible
contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible
joint and several liability, the timeframe over which
remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws
and regulations. For sites where the company has been named a
PRP, management does hot currently anticipate any additional
liability to result from the inability of other significant
named parties to contribute. The Company expects that such
accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten
years. As assessments and remediation activities progress at
each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and
adjusted to reflect additional information as it become
available. There have been no environmental problems to date
that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
While it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding
the amounts recorded may have been incurred, the potential
exposure is not expected to be materially different than the
amounts recorded.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo
Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.
(“Enzo”) filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil
Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham PLC, Amersham
Biosciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life
Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical
Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid
Biosciences, Inc. The six count complaint alleges that the
Company has breached its distributorship and settlement
agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in
unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo
by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and
exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology,
separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks
injunctive and monetary relief. On May 28, 2003, the court
severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

individual complaints against the five
defendants. Enzo served its new complaint on July 16, 2003,
and the Company subsequently filed an answer denying the
substantive allegations and including a counterclaim alleging
that several of Enzo’s patents are invalid.

On June 14, 2002, the Company sold its
Security and Detection Systems business to L-3 Communications
Corporation (“L-3”). L-3 and several of its affiliates
have been named as defendants in litigation arising out of the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Among the claims
in that litigation are allegations that there were defects in
the products of the Security and Detection Systems business that
the Company sold to L-3. L-3 has asserted that the Company is
contractually obligated to indemnify L-3 for any liability it
may incur as a result of that litigation. The Company intends to
contest these matters vigorously. The Company is currently
unable, however, to determine whether resolution of these
matters will have a material adverse impact on its financial
position or on its consolidated results of operations.
Therefore, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the
amount of the loss, if any, which may result from resolution of
these matters.

The Company and certain of our officers have been
named as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the
plaintiffs have alleged various statements made by us were
misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating
results. The Company believes we have meritorious defenses to
the lawsuits and intend to contest the actions vigorously. The
Company is currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the
amount of the loss, if any that may result from the resolution
of these matters.

Note 18:     Warranty
Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for
certain products for periods ranging from one to three years
beyond the date of sale. The majority of costs associated with
warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the
time of service personnel to respond to repair and replacement
requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical
results, supplemented by management’s expectations of
future costs. A summary of warranty reserve activity for the
years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 is
as follows:

Note 19:     Stockholders’
Equity

Stock-Based
Compensation.

As of December 28,
2003, the Company had three stock-based compensation plans.
Under the 2001 Incentive Plan, 8.8 million shares of the
Company’s common stock were made available for option
grants, restricted stock awards, performance units and other
stock-based awards. Under the Life Sciences Plan,
2.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock were
made available for option grants. Under the third plan, the
Company is not making future grants.

The following table summarizes stock option
activity for the three years ended December 28, 2003:

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding at December 28, 2003:

The weighted-average fair value of options
granted during 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $4.95, $12.06, and
$14.40, respectively. The values were estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
following weighted-average assumptions were used in the model:

In April 1999, the Company’s stockholders
approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, whereby
participating employees currently have the right to purchase
common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing
price on the first day or the last day of the six-month offering
period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase,
subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the
employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed 10%
of base compensation. During 2003, the Company issued
676,368 shares under this plan at a weighted-average price
of $9.10 per share. During 2002, the Company issued
739,302 shares under this plan at a weighted-average price
of $8.39 per share. During 2001, the Company issued
449,082 shares under this plan at a weighted-average price
of $23.40 per share. There remains available for sale to
employees an aggregate of 2.5 million shares of the
Company’s stock out of 5 million shares authorized by
shareholders.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Other:

The Company
has awarded restricted stock to certain executive employees and
directors that contain vesting provisions and performance
targets. These shares were awarded under the Company’s 1999
Incentive Plan. The compensation expense associated with the
fair value of these awards is recognized over the period that
the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The
unearned portion of the awards is reflected in
stockholders’ equity as unearned compensation until the
restrictions are released and the compensation is earned. During
the three years ended December 28, 2003, the Company
awarded 5,000 shares in 2003, 190,000 shares in 2002
and 15,000 shares in 2001, with weighted-average fair
values of $15.83 per share in 2003, $23.45 per share
in 2002 and $28.13 per share in 2001. The total
compensation recognized related to these restricted shares was
approximately $2.8 million in 2003, $2.6 million in
2002 and $3.5 million in 2001. As of December 28,
2003, there were 430,000 shares outstanding subject to
forfeiture.

The components of accumulated
other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax were as follows:

The tax effects related to each component of
other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note 20:     Financial
Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. The
Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit
risk as of December 28, 2003.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent
with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign
currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include
intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The
contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies,
generally have maturities that do not exceed 12 months,
have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at
fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and
market risk are not significant as the foreign exchange
instruments are contracted with major banking institutions.
Gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency
contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges
designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash
flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a
component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are
recognized in income in the period in which the underlying
anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended
December 28, 2003, the Company did not engage in hedges
designated as cash flow. The notional amount of the outstanding
foreign currency contracts designated as fair value was
approximately $168.5 million as of December 28, 2003
and $103.0 million at December 29, 2002. The fair
value of the Company’s foreign currency derivative
contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses are not
material.

In January 2004, the Company entered into two
interest rate swap instruments with financial institutions. The
swap agreements were designated as a fair value hedge related to
$100 million of its senior subordinated notes due 2013.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The Company estimates the fair value of financial
instruments based on interest rates available to the Company and
by comparison to quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the
short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.

The fair values of marketable securities included
in investments have been determined using available quoted
market prices for such securities. The carrying value of the
Company’s other equity investments are considered
reasonable estimates of the fair values of those investments.
The fair value and carrying value of the Company’s
investments are disclosed in Note 11 above.

The outstanding term debt on the Company’s
senior credit facility totaled $245.0 million and
$315.0 million at December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, respectively. No amounts were
outstanding under the revolving facility. The interest rate on
the Company’s senior credit facility is reset monthly to
reflect variable



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rates that reflect currently available terms and
conditions for similar debt. Consequently, the carrying value of
the credit facility approximates fair value.

The fair value of 8 7/8% notes and the
6.8% notes are estimated using market quotes from brokers
or are based on current rates offered for similar debt. At
December 29, 2003, the 8 7/8% notes and the
6.8% notes had an aggregate carrying value of
$302 million and a fair value of $350 million. At
December 29, 2002, the 8 7/8% notes and the
6.8% notes had an aggregate carrying value of
$302 million that approximated fair value.

Note 21:     Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment
under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing
operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 amounted to
$37.2 million, $36.6 million, and $27.1 million,
respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable
operating leases are as follows: $33.6 million in 2004,
$25.0 million in 2005, $22.6 million in 2006,
$13.8 million in 2007, $12.8 million in 2008 and
$129.7 million in 2009 and thereafter.

Note 22:     Guarantor
Financial Information

The Company has outstanding $300 million in
aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes (the “8 7/8 Notes”) due 2013.
The Company’s payment obligations under the
8 7/8% Notes are guaranteed by some of the
Company’s domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantor
Subsidiaries”), all of which are wholly owned by the
Company. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint
and several. The following supplemental financial information
sets forth, on an unconsolidated basis, income statement,
balance sheet and statements of cash flow information for the
Company (“Parent Company Only”), for the Guarantor
Subsidiaries and for the Company’s other subsidiaries (the
“Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The supplemental
financial information reflects the investments of the Company
and the Guarantor Subsidiaries in the Guarantor and
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting.

Note 23:     Industry
Segment and Geographic Area Information

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company
announced plans to combine its Life Sciences and Analytical
Instruments businesses into one business, Life and Analytical
Sciences, with changes to organization, processes and systems
expected during 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, the Company
completed many of the changes involved in the combination
including the integration of facilities and management reporting
and systems. Therefore, commencing in the second quarter of
2003, the two segments were aggregated into one reporting
segment for financial statement purposes as discrete financial
information is only available on a combined basis. The three
reportable segments reflect the Company’s management and
structure under three strategic business units (SBUs). For
comparative purposes the Company has disclosed its Life Science
and Analytical Science segments as one reporting segment for all
periods presented.

The accounting policies of the reporting segments
are the same as those described in Note 1. The Company
evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on
sales and operating profit. Interseg-

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange

We assumed the Life Sciences Incentive Plan when
we acquired Packard BioScience Company. The Life Sciences Plan
and our 2001 Incentive Plan are the only two plans from which we
continue to make grants. Although the 2001 plan was approved by
our stockholders, the Life Sciences plan was not. We assumed the
1999 Vivid Technologies Equity Incentive Plan when we acquired
Vivid Technologies, Inc. We are not making future grants
from the Vivid plan. The Vivid plan was not approved by our
stockholders.

Shares subject to
Plans:

A maximum of
2,322,606 shares in the Life Sciences plan, as adjusted,
were approved by the stockholders of the Packard BioScience
Company for awards under the plan. A maximum of
600,000 shares in the Vivid plan were approved by the
stockholders of Vivid Technologies, Inc. for awards under
the Vivid plan. We have made and will make appropriate
adjustments to the shares subject to these plans and to

stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification or
similar change in our capital structure. To the extent that any
outstanding option under the Life Sciences plan expires or
terminates prior to exercise in full or if shares issued upon
exercise of an option or pursuant to a stock issuance are
repurchased by us, the shares of common stock for which such
option is not exercised, or the repurchased shares, are returned
to the Life Sciences plan and become available for future grant.

Eligibility:

Our
employees, excluding officers and directors, and any individuals
who have accepted an offer for employment are eligible to be
granted options or awards under the Plans. No new awards may be
made under the Vivid plan.

Administration:

The
Life Sciences plan and the Vivid plan are administered by our
Board of Directors. The Board has the authority to grant options
and awards and to adopt, amend and repeal administrative rules,
guidelines and practices. The Board also may delegate the power
to make awards to one or more executive officers of the Company,
provided that the Board fixes the maximum number of shares
subject to awards and the maximum number of shares for any one
participant to be made by such executive officers. The Board may
delegate any or all of its powers under the Life Sciences plan
or the Vivid plan to one or more committees of the Board.

Terms and
conditions:

Under each of the Life
Sciences and the Vivid plans, the Board may grant options to
purchase common stock and determine the number of shares to be
covered by each option, the exercise price, and the conditions
and limitations applicable to the exercise of each option. The
exercise price at the time of option grant may not be less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time
the option is granted. The option term cannot exceed
10 years. The Board also may grant awards based upon the
common stock, including awards of restricted stock and stock
appreciation rights as well as performance awards. No new awards
may be made under the Vivid plan.



Adjustments for Changes in Common Stock and
Certain Other Events:

Under each of
the Life Sciences and the Vivid plans, in the event of our
proposed liquidation or dissolution, the Board will provide that
all then unexercised options will become exercisable in full and
terminate effective upon the liquidation or dissolution, except
to the extent exercised before the effective date. The Board may
specify the effect of a liquidation or dissolution on any award
granted under the plans. In the event of an acquisition, defined
as any merger or consolidation of PerkinElmer with or into
another entity as a result of which our common stock is
converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash,
securities or other property or any exchange of shares of
PerkinElmer for cash, securities or other property pursuant to a
statutory share exchange transaction, the Board will provide
that all outstanding options will be assumed, or equivalent
options will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding
corporation. If the acquiring or succeeding corporation does not
agree to assume, or substitute for the options, the Board will
provide that unexercised options will become exercisable in full
as of a specified time prior to the event.

Amendment:

The Board
may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the plans.

Other Plans

We have granted options to our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer in January 1999 under a plan that was not
approved by stockholders.

Shares subject to the
plan:

A maximum of 900,000 shares
in the plan were approved for awards under the plan. Appropriate
adjustments will be made to the shares subject to options
outstanding under the plan upon a stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination,
reclassification, or similar change in our capital structure.
The options granted to our Chief Executive Officer were the sole
awards authorized for grant under the plan. No additional grants
may be made under the plan.

Administration:

The
plan is administered by our Board of Directors. The Board has
the authority to adopt, amend and repeal administrative rules,
guidelines and practices. The Board may delegate any or all of
its powers under the plan to one or more committees of the Board.

Terms and
conditions:

We made two option grants
totaling 900,000 shares to our Chief Executive Officer
under this plan. The first grant was made on January 8,
1998, for 400,000 shares with a per share exercise price of
$10.59 and an expiration date in January 2008. The option vested
in full in January 2001. The second grant was made on
January 20, 1999, for 500,000 shares with a per share
exercise price of $13.63 and an expiration date in January 2009.
The option vested in full in January 2000. Vesting of the second
option accelerated based on satisfaction of the performance
target of 50% cumulative growth in our earnings per share within
two (2) years or less over the base year 1998, adjusted for
the effects of acquisitions and divestitures. In each case, the
option exercise price represented the fair market price of the
stock on the date of grant. Upon the death or total disability
of the optionee, he or his estate has one year to exercise
vested options. Upon retirement at a PerkinElmer-recognized
retirement age the optionee has the earlier of three (3) years
or January 2009 to exercise vested options. Upon termination of
the optionee’s employment, all further vesting stops and
all unvested shares are cancelled. Upon a change in control of
PerkinElmer, all unvested options become 100% vested.
