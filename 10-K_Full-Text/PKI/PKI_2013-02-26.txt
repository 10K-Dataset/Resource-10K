Our Strategy

Our strategy is to provide innovative products, services and solutions that drive scientific enhancements and productivity improvements in targeted high growth market segments and to develop value-added applications and solutions to foster further development and expansion of the markets we serve. To execute on our strategy and drive higher revenue growth, we focus on broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative technology and expenditures for research and development. Our strategy includes:

•

Achieving significant growth in both of our core business segments, Human Health and Environmental Health, through strategic acquisitions and licensing;

•

Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and third-party collaborations and alliances;

•

Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;

•

Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and

•

Attracting, retaining and developing talented and engaged employees.

Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently taken the following actions:

Strategic Business Re-Alignment:

We announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2013 that will allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective, affordable and accessible around the world. Our field service for products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, as well as our Informatics business, will be moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. We will report our financial results beginning in fiscal year 2013 using this new alignment under our Human Health and Environmental Health segments.

Business Combination:

Acquisition of Haoyuan Biotech Co., Ltd.

In November 2012, we acquired all outstanding stock of Shanghai Haoyuan Biotech Co., Ltd. ("Haoyuan"). Haoyuan is a provider of nucleic acid-based blood screening solutions for the blood banking and clinical diagnostics markets. We expect this acquisition to extend our capabilities into nucleic acid blood screening, as well as deepen our position in the growing molecular clinical diagnostics market in China. We paid the shareholders of Haoyuan

$38.0 million

in cash for the stock of Haoyuan. We recorded a receivable of

$2.7 million

from the shareholders of Haoyuan as a reduction of purchase price for the settlement of certain contingencies. As of the closing date, we potentially had to pay the shareholders additional contingent consideration of up to

$30.0 million

, which at closing had an estimated fair value of

$1.9 million

. We reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.



Restructuring:

During

fiscal year 2012

, we recorded a

$16.8 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities, the closure of excess facility space, and contract termination costs. We also recognized a

$7.4 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and contract termination costs. Our management approved these plans principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets, to realign operations and production resources as a result of recent acquisitions and to shift resources to a newly established shared service center. We also recorded an additional pre-tax restructuring

charge

of

$0.3 million

primarily related to higher than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in Europe within the Human Health segment, as well as an additional

reversal

of

$0.9 million

primarily related to a reduction in the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in Europe within the Environmental Health segment. We also recorded a pre-tax charge of

$1.5 million

during

fiscal year 2012

primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities in our Environmental Health segment. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending required to realign operations. We expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows will exceed

$11.0 million

on an annual basis beginning in fiscal year 2014, primarily as decreases to cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses.

As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following action:

Share Repurchase Program:

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors (our "Board") authorized us to repurchase up to

10.0 million

shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On August 31, 2010, we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase an additional

5.0 million

shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program expired on October 22, 2012. On October 24, 2012, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to

6.0 million

shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "New Repurchase Program"). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 24, 2014 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During

fiscal year 2012

, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under either of the stock repurchase programs. During

fiscal year 2011

, we repurchased approximately

4.0 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$107.8 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During

fiscal year 2010

, we repurchased approximately

3.0 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$71.5 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of

December 30, 2012

, all

6.0 million

shares authorized by our Board under the New Repurchase Program remained available for repurchase. From December 31, 2012 through

February 22, 2013

, we repurchased approximately

2.6 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$89.0 million

, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program.

Business Segments and Products

We report our business in two segments: Human Health and Environmental Health. We performed our annual impairment testing on

January 2, 2012

, the annual impairment date for our reporting units, and based on the first step of the impairment process (the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value), we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment.

We announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2013 that will allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective, affordable and accessible around the world. Our field service for products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, as well as our Informatics business, will be moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. We will report our financial results beginning in fiscal year 2013 using this new alignment under our Human Health and Environmental Health segments.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces. As of

December 30, 2012

, we employed approximately

3,500

sales and service representatives operating in approximately


countries and marketing products and services in more than


countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in a lawsuit involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of this matter.

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.



Competition

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were approximately

$132.6 million

during

fiscal year 2012

, approximately

$115.8 million

during

fiscal year 2011

, and approximately

$94.8 million

during

fiscal year 2010

.

We directed our research and development efforts in

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during

fiscal year 2013

, and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued

$6.1 million

as of

December 30, 2012

, which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of the ultimate remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. In fiscal year 2007, we accrued

$9.7 million

representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters, which was damaged in the fire. We paid

$2.5 million

during fiscal year 2009,

$1.6 million

during fiscal year 2008 and

$3.9 million

during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We sold the building on April 27, 2010. Net proceeds from the sale were

$11.0 million

, and we recorded a pre-tax gain of

$3.4 million

in operating income.



We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of

December 30, 2012

, we employed approximately

7,500

employees in our continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As of

December 30, 2012

, we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately

1,600

union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Reporting Segments

We have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the expense related to mark-to-market on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our reporting segments.

The table below sets forth revenue and operating income (loss), excluding discontinued operations, by reporting segment for the fiscal years ended:

____________________________

(1)

The pre-tax impairment charges have been included in the Human Health and Environmental Health operating income from continuing operations. We recognized

$54.3 million

of pre-tax impairment charges in the Human Health segment and also recognized

$19.9 million

of pre-tax impairment charges in the Environmental Health segment in

fiscal year 2012

. We recognized a

$3.0 million

pre-tax impairment charge in the Human Health segment in

fiscal year 2011

. There were no impairment charges during

fiscal year 2010

.

(2)

The expenses related to mark-to-market on postretirement benefit plans have been included in the Corporate operating loss from continuing operations, and together constituted a pre-tax loss of

$31.8 million

in

fiscal year 2012

, a pre-tax loss of

$67.9 million

in

fiscal year 2011

, and a pre-tax loss of

$0.2 million

in

fiscal year 2010

.



Additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During

fiscal year 2012

, we had

$1,292.3 million

in sales from our international operations, representing approximately

60%

of our total sales. During

fiscal year 2012

, we derived approximately

41%

of our international sales from our Human Health segment, and approximately

59%

of our international sales from our Environmental Health segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:

If the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our



consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.

Our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities.

We have operations in many parts of the world. While the global economy began showing signs of gradual improvement in 2010 from its significant downturn in 2008 and 2009, debt and equity markets experienced renewed disruption beginning early in the third quarter of 2011, including the downgrading of government issued debt in the United States and other countries, and the prospects of an economic recovery remain uncertain particularly as the United States and other countries continue to balance concerns around debt, inflation, growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be sustainable, or that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to access capital. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.

While we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities, a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties, cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.

Certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments, or other measures, and some of these risks are insurable, but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful. Our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.

We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:

•

accurately anticipate customer needs,

•

innovate and develop new technologies and applications,

•

successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,

•

price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and

•

differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.



We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable, or successfully divest businesses.

We have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisition of Haoyuan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and Caliper in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, such as:

•

competition among buyers and licensees,

•

the high valuations of businesses and technologies,

•

the need for regulatory and other approval, and

•

our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.

Some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences, loss of key personnel, unforeseen regulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. Additionally, if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest, the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures. As a result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which may adversely impact our profitability.

We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. The expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.

Third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries.

If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.



Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.

Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. As a result, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

demand for and market acceptance of our products,

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,

•

changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,

•

changes in general economic conditions or government funding,

•

settlements of income tax audits,

•

expenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation,

•

changes in our effective tax rate,

•

changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,

•

changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers,

•

our ability to introduce new products,

•

our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,

•

costs of raw materials, energy or supplies,

•

our ability to execute ongoing productivity initiatives,

•

changes in the volume or timing of product orders,

•

fluctuation in the expense related to mark-to-market on postretirement benefit plans, and

•

changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions.

A significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.

We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States; TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe; and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products



could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers.

Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

The manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products, services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries. If we fail to comply with those regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of the products produced by our Human Health segment are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.



Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total revenue in

fiscal year 2012

. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates,

•

changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,

•

adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives,

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations,

•

difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States,

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws,

•

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection,

•

increasing global enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and

•

differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers and scientists, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees.

Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems, software and technologies successfully, our business could be adversely affected.

We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.



We have a substantial amount of outstanding debt, which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business.

Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

•

requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and stock repurchases;

•

reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and

•

exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.

In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.

Restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities.

Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, our 6% senior unsecured notes due 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and our 5% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,

•

sell assets,

•

incur obligations that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to make dividend or other payments to us,

•

guarantee or secure indebtedness,

•

enter into transactions with affiliates, and

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating, our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments.

Any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, our 2015 Notes, our 2021 Notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances.

Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.

As of

December 30, 2012

, our total assets included

$2.7 billion

of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, core technology and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “non-amortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets.

Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Human Health and Environmental Health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.



Our share price will fluctuate.

Over the last several quarters, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors,

•

the financial performance of the major end markets that we target,

•

the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us,

•

announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, and

•

changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.

Dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.

On

January 25, 2013

, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of

$0.07

per share for the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

that will be payable in

May 2013

. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

(collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo's patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo's patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. We filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo's patents are invalid. In 2007, after the court issued a decision in 2006 regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo's patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excluded certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo's patents, summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants.



The case was assigned to a new district court judge in January 2009 and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided Enzo's appeal of the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the “Connecticut Case”), which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of Enzo's case against us. In March 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. The district court permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants. On September 12, 2012, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. On December 21, 2012, we filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion. The second motion is pending. The district court has permitted Enzo to take limited discovery directed to the motion with briefing to be concluded in May 2013.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above, and we are contesting the action vigorously. While this matter is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at

December 30, 2012

should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

January 2, 2011

,

January 3, 2010

and

December 28, 2008

The following selected historical financial information should be read together with our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.



____________________________

(1)

In fiscal year 2012, we adopted new guidance for certain of our health care businesses that recognize patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered where we do not assess the patient's ability to pay at such time. The effects of the adoption on our consolidated statements of operations were decreases to revenue with corresponding decreases to selling, general and administrative expenses of

$2.8 million

in

fiscal year 2012

,

$2.8 million

in

fiscal year 2011

,

$2.6 million

in

fiscal year 2010

, $4.0 million in fiscal year 2009 and $6.3 million in fiscal year 2008.

(2)

The expense related to mark-to-market on postretirement benefit plans was a pre-tax loss of

$31.8 million

in

fiscal year 2012

, a pre-tax loss of

$67.9 million

in

fiscal year 2011

, a pre-tax loss of

$0.2 million

in

fiscal year 2010

, a pre-tax loss of $6.4 million in fiscal year 2009 and a pre-tax loss of $75.2 million in fiscal year 2008.

(3)

We adopted the authoritative guidance for stock compensation on January 2, 2006. The total incremental pre-tax compensation expense recorded in continuing operations related to stock options was

$5.1 million

in

fiscal year 2012

, $4.5 million in

fiscal year 2011

, $6.2 million in

fiscal year 2010

, $7.9 million in fiscal year 2009 and $9.2 million in fiscal year 2008.

(4)

We incurred pre-tax restructuring and contract termination charges, net, of

$25.1 million

in

fiscal year 2012

,

$13.5 million

in

fiscal year 2011

,

$19.0 million

in

fiscal year 2010

,

$18.0 million

in fiscal year 2009, and

$6.7 million

in fiscal year 2008.

(5)

On April 27, 2010 we sold a building which provided net proceeds of $11.0 million. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.4 million in operating income.

(6)

In fiscal year 2012, we incurred pre-tax impairment charges of

$74.2 million

as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy. In fiscal year 2011, we incurred a pre-tax impairment charge of

$3.0 million

for the full impairment of license agreements, that we no longer intend to use.

(7)

In fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2011, interest expense was

$45.8 million

and

$24.8 million

, respectively, primarily due to the increased debt and the higher interest rates on those debt balances with the issuance of the senior unsecured notes due 2021. For fiscal year 2011, acquisition related financing costs related to certain acquisitions added an additional expense of

$3.1 million

, and is included in interest expense.

(8)

In fiscal year 2010, we acquired the remaining fifty percent equity interest in our joint venture (the "ICPMS Joint Venture") with the company previously known as MDS, Inc. for the development and manufacturing of our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry product line. The fair value of the acquisition was $67.7 million, including cash consideration of $35.0 million, non-cash consideration of $2.6 million for certain non-exclusive rights to intangible assets we own, and $30.4 million representing the fair value of our fifty percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture held prior to the acquisition. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $25.6 million from the re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. This pre-tax gain is reported in interest and other (income) expense, net, for fiscal year 2010.

(9)

In fiscal year 2008, we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million upon the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes, and recognized $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive (loss) income. We also discontinued forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million during fiscal year 2008. The discontinued cash flow hedges were immediately settled with counterparties, and the $17.5 million loss was recognized as interest and other (income) expense, net. In addition, during fiscal year 2008, interest expense was $23.7 million due to higher outstanding debt balances with the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes that primarily related to the purchase of ViaCell, Inc., which was partially offset by lower interest rates on our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

(10)

The fiscal year 2012 benefit from income taxes was primarily due to a tax benefit of

$7.0 million

related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions, which included the pre-tax impairment charges of

$74.2 million

, partially offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

(11)

The fiscal year 2011 effective tax rate on continuing operations of

98.2%

was primarily due to the fiscal year 2011 provision of

$79.7 million

related to our planned

$350.0 million

repatriation of previously unremitted earnings.



(12)

The fiscal year 2010 effective tax rate on continuing operations of

16.3%

was primarily due to the favorable impact related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture.

(13)

The fiscal year 2008 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 12.3% was primarily due to a $15.6 million benefit related to the settlement of various income tax audits.

(14)

In fiscal year 2008, our Board of Directors (our "Board") approved separate plans to shut down our ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, and our Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations, Analytical Proteomics Instruments and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments businesses. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $12.8 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.

(15)

In November 2010, we sold our Illumination and Detection Solutions (“IDS”) business for approximately $500.0 million, $482.0 million net of payments for acquired cash balances, subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $315.3 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our IDS business. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations.

(16)

In May 2008, we issued and sold seven-year senior notes at a rate of 6% with a face value of $150.0 million and received $150.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. The debt, which matures in May 2015, is unsecured.

(17)

In October 2011, we issued and sold ten-year senior notes at a rate of

5%

with a face value of

$500.0 million

and received

$496.9 million

of net proceeds from the issuance. The debt, which matures in November 2021, is unsecured.

(18)

In June 2009, our consolidated subsidiary exercised the right to terminate the receivables purchase agreement with a third-party financial institution releasing both parties of their rights, liabilities and obligations under this agreement. We had an undivided interest in the receivables that had been sold to the third-party financial institution under this agreement of $40.0 million as of December 28, 2008.

(19)

In

fiscal year 2012

, we did

no

t repurchase any shares of common stock under either of the stock purchase repurchase programs. In fiscal year 2011, we repurchased in the open market approximately

4.0 million

shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of

$107.8 million

, including commissions. In fiscal year 2010, we repurchased in the open market approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $71.5 million, including commissions. In fiscal year 2009, we repurchased in the open market approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions. In fiscal year 2008, we repurchased in the open market approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $75.5 million, including commissions. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in October 2008, as modified in August 2010, which expired in October 2012.

Overview of Fiscal Year


During

fiscal year 2012

, we continued to see good performance from acquisitions, investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives. Our overall revenue in

fiscal year 2012

increase

d

$196.7 million

, or

10%

, as compared to

fiscal year 2011

, reflecting an

increase

of

$159.7 million

, or

18%

, in our Human Health segment revenue and an

increase

of

$37.0 million

, or

4%

, in our Environmental Health segment revenue. The

increase

in our Human Health segment revenue during

fiscal year 2012

was due to growth in the research market, including the addition of Caliper Life Sciences, Inc. ("Caliper"), as well as growth generated from both our screening and our medical imaging businesses within the diagnostics market. The

increase

in our Environmental Health segment revenue during

fiscal year 2012

was due to growth in our informatics offerings within the laboratory services market and growth from our environmental, food and consumer safety and testing products, partially offset by decreased demand for our applications in the industrial markets.

In our Human Health segment during

fiscal year 2012

as compared to

fiscal year 2011

, we experienced growth in the research market due to continued demand for our in-vivo imaging systems with the addition of Caliper imaging systems, as well as increased demand for our JANUS

®

automation tools and our Operetta

®

cellular imaging systems. The growth in the research market was partially offset by reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from reduced research and development spending, as well as a decline in demand for our suite of radioactive reagents, particularly in Europe and Japan. We also experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the United States continue to stabilize and from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets such as China. In our medical imaging business, we had continued growth from our traditional diagnostic imaging offerings, as well as increased demand for our complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (“CMOS”) imaging technology, particularly in the fields of mammography, dental and orthopedics. As the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers, we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease, which can result in savings of long-term health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients, are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets.

In our Environmental Health segment, our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time, while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for our customers. During

fiscal year 2012

, we had increased demand for our informatics offerings, and we continued to grow our laboratory services business by adding new customers to our OneSource multivendor service offering. Sales of environmental, food and consumer safety and testing products also grew in

fiscal year 2012

, as compared to

fiscal year 2011

, as increased regulations in environmental and food safety markets continued to drive demand for our analytical instrumentation and follow-on consumables, particularly in China and South America. We saw continued strength in our inorganic analysis solutions, such as our NexION

®

mass spectrometer, as trace metals identification remains a critical component of contaminant detection for environmental, as well as food and consumer safety, applications. These increases were partially offset by decreased demand for our applications in the industrial markets. We believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed, resulting in continued demand for efficient, analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions.

Our consolidated gross margins

increase

d


basis points in

fiscal year 2012

, as compared to

fiscal year 2011

, due to the lower

fiscal year 2012

mark-to-market charge for our postretirement benefit plans, increased sales volume, changes in product mix with growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and productivity improvements. Our consolidated operating



margin

decrease

d


basis points in

fiscal year 2012

, as compared to

fiscal year 2011

, primarily due to the

fiscal year 2012

pre-tax impairment charges of

$74.2 million

as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy and increased costs related to growth and productivity investments, partially offset by a lower

fiscal year 2012

mark-to-market charge for our postretirement benefit plans, higher gross margins and cost containment and productivity initiatives.

We believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the stable spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services. Overall, we believe that our strategic focus on Human Health and Environmental Health coupled with our breadth of end markets, deep portfolio of technologies and applications, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth.

Restructuring and Contract Termination Charges, Net

We have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, alignment with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units. Restructuring and contract termination charges, net, for

fiscal year 2012

were a

$25.1 million

charge, as compared to a

$13.5 million

charge for

fiscal year 2011

and an

$19.0 million

charge for

fiscal year 2010

.

The following table summarizes our restructuring and contract termination accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan, as well as contract termination, during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

:

The restructuring plans for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and fourth and second quarter of fiscal year 2011 were intended principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets. The restructuring plan for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 was intended to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center. The restructuring plans for the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2012 were intended principally to realign operations, research and development resources, and production resources as a result of recent acquisitions. The activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses and are included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate cost savings from the restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending required to realign operations. We expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows will exceed

$11.0 million

on an annual basis beginning in fiscal year 2014, primarily as decreases to cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses.

Q4 2012 Restructuring Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, our management approved a plan to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets (the “Q4 2012 Plan”). As a result of the Q4 2012 Plan, we recognized a

$0.6 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and recognized a

$2.4 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities.

As part of the Q4 2012 Plan, we reduced headcount by


employees. All employees were notified of termination by December 30, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of

$2.7 million

for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2014.

The following table summarizes the components of our Q4 2012 Plan activity recognized by segment:



Q3 2012 Restructuring Plan

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, our management approved a plan to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center (the “Q3 2012 Plan”). As a result of the Q3 2012 Plan, we recognized

$3.7 million

pre-tax restructuring charges in each of the Human Health and Environmental Health segments related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. During

fiscal year 2012

, we also recorded an additional pre-tax restructuring accrual of

$0.3 million

relating to the Q3 2012 plan due to higher than expected costs associated with the workforce reduction from reorganization activities within both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments.

As part of the Q3 2012 Plan, we will reduce headcount by


employees. All employees were notified of termination by September 30, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of

$7.6 million

for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.

$7.2 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and recognized a

$0.2 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities throughout fiscal year 2012. We expect to recognize an additional

$2.2 million

of incremental restructuring expense in future periods as services are provided for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits. Such benefits will be recognized ratably over the required service period.

As part of the Q2 2012 Plan, we will reduce headcount by


employees. All employees were notified of termination by July 1, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of

$4.6 million

for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2014.

$5.4 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space and recognized a

$1.0 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities throughout fiscal year 2012. We expect to recognize no additional incremental restructuring expense in future periods as all services were provided for one-time termination benefits in which the employee was required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits.

As part of the Q1 2012 Plan, we will reduce headcount by


employees. All employees were notified of termination and actions related to the closure of excess facility space were completed by April 1, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of

$1.3 million

$2.3 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and recognized a

$4.6 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. During

fiscal year 2012

, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of

$0.1 million

relating to the Q4 2011 Plan due to a reduction in the estimated costs associated with the closure of an excess facility in the Environmental Health segment.

As part of the Q4 2011 Plan, we reduced headcount by


employees. All employees were notified of termination and actions related to the closure of excess facility space were completed by January 1, 2012, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space and also recognized a

$3.4 million

pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. During the

fiscal year 2012

, we recorded a reversal of the pre-tax restructuring accrual of

$0.2 million

relating to the Q2 2011 Plan due to lower than expected costs associated with the workforce reduction from reorganization activities within the Environmental Health segment.

As part of the Q2 2011 Plan, we reduced headcount by


employees. All employees were notified of termination and actions related to the closure of excess facility space were completed by July 3, 2011, and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of

The following table summarizes the components of our Q2 2011 Plan activity recognized by segment:

Previous Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years 2001 through


were workforce reductions related to the integration of our businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy. During

fiscal year 2012

, we paid

$4.0 million

related to these plans and recorded an additional

charge

of

$0.2 million

related to higher than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in Europe within the Human Health segment, as well as a

reversal

of

$0.7 million

primarily related to a reduction in the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in Europe within the Environmental Health segment. As of

December 30, 2012

, we had approximately

$10.0 million

of remaining liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans, primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities and remaining severance payments for workforce reductions in both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments. We expect to make payments for these leases, the terms of which vary in length, through fiscal year 2022.

Contract Termination Charges

We have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. We recorded a pre-tax charge of

$1.5 million

in

fiscal year 2012

, a pre-tax charge of

$2.0 million

in

fiscal year 2011

and a pre-tax charge of

$0.1 million

in

fiscal year 2010

, primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in our Environmental Health segment. We made payments for these obligations of

$2.9 million

during

fiscal year 2012

,

$0.4 million

during

fiscal year 2011

, and

$1.7 million

during

fiscal year 2010

. The remaining balance of these accruals as of

December 30, 2012

was

$0.6 million

.

in

fiscal year 2012

, as compared to

$3.0 million

in

fiscal year 2011

. As part of integrating our recent acquisitions, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the PerkinElmer trade name. Accordingly, we undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of

$74.2 million

in fiscal year 2012. We recognized

$54.3 million

pre-tax impairment charges in the Human Health segment and also recognized

$19.9 million

pre-tax impairment charges in the Environmental Health segment. Additional information regarding this impairment is discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

fiscal year 2011

as compared to

fiscal year 2010

was primarily due to (i) a provision of

$79.7 million

in

fiscal year 2011

related to our planned

$350.0 million

repatriation of previously unremitted earnings, partially offset by (ii) changes in the geographic distribution of profits, with increases in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

Discontinued Operations

As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of

December 30, 2012

and

January 1, 2012

.



We recorded the following pre-tax gains and losses, which have been reported as a net gain on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended:

In November 2010, we sold our IDS business, which was included in the Environmental Health segment, for

$510.3 million

including an adjustment for net working capital, to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure, and to provide capital to reinvest in other Human Health and Environmental Health end markets. The buyer acquired our IDS business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in Germany, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in Singapore and Germany. We recognized a pre-tax gain of

$315.3 million

, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our IDS business. During fiscal year 2011, we updated the net working capital adjustment associated with the sale of this business and other potential contingencies, which resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax loss of

$1.8 million

. These gains and losses were recognized as gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations.

In December 2008, our management approved a plan to divest our Photoflash business within our Environmental Health segment. In June 2010, we sold the Photoflash business for

$13.5 million

, including an adjustment for net working capital, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of

$4.4 million

, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale. During fiscal year 2012, we recognized a pre-tax gain of

$2.5 million

for contingent consideration related to this sale. These gains were recognized as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations.

During

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

, we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations. We recognized a pre-tax

gain

of

$3.9 million

in

fiscal year 2011

and a pre-tax

loss

of

$1.8 million

in

fiscal year 2010

. The

fiscal year 2011

pre-tax gain included

$4.0 million

for contingent consideration related to the sale of our semiconductor business in fiscal year 2006.

Summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows for the fiscal years ended:

We recognized a tax

provision

of

$0.9 million

on discontinued operations in

fiscal year 2012

, a tax

benefit

of

$4.5 million

on discontinued operations in

fiscal year 2011

and a tax

provision

of

$96.6 million

in

fiscal year 2010

on discontinued operations. The recognition of

$4.5 million

income tax benefit in

fiscal year 2011

is primarily the net result of a change in estimate related to the federal income tax liability associated with the repatriation of the unremitted earnings of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, as further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, offset by the tax provision on the contingent consideration received in fiscal year 2011 related to the sale of our semiconductor business in fiscal year 2006. The recognition of

$96.6 million

income tax expense in fiscal year 2010 includes

$16.0 million

of income tax expense associated with unremitted earnings of directly-owned foreign subsidiaries that no longer qualified as indefinitely reinvested once the subsidiary was held for sale, and

$65.8 million

related to the federal income tax liability associated with the repatriation of the unremitted earnings of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, as further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.



Business Combinations

Acquisition of Haoyuan Biotech Co., Ltd.

In November 2012, we acquired all outstanding stock of Haoyuan. Haoyuan is a provider of nucleic acid-based blood screening solutions for the blood banking and clinical diagnostics markets. We expect this acquisition to extend our capabilities into nucleic acid blood screening, as well as deepen our position in the growing molecular clinical diagnostics market in China.

Labtronics tools can be applied to procedure-based problems, including laboratory analysis, equipment calibration and validation, cleaning validation and other problems. We paid the shareholders of Labtronics

$11.4 million

in cash for the stock of Labtronics. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Geospiza, Inc.

In May 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Geospiza, Inc. ("Geospiza"). Geospiza is a developer of software systems for the management of genetic analysis and laboratory workflows.

$4.2 million

from the shareholders of CambridgeSoft as a reduction of purchase price for the settlement of contingencies. During the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

, we settled the contingencies and collected the receivable. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of ID Biological Systems, Inc.

In March 2011, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of ID Biological Systems, Inc. ("IDB"). IDB is a manufacturer of filter paper-based sample collection devices for neonatal screening and prenatal diagnostics. We expect this acquisition to enhance our market position in the prenatal and neonatal markets. We paid

$7.7 million

$3.3 million

, which at closing had an estimated fair value of

$0.3 million

. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of ArtusLabs, Inc.

In March 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of ArtusLabs, Inc. ("ArtusLabs"). ArtusLabs offers the Ensemble

We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG.

In February 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG ("chemagen"). chemagen manufactures and sells nucleic acid sample preparation systems and reagents utilizing magnetic bead technology. We expect this acquisition to enhance our diagnostics business by expanding our product offerings to diagnostics, academic and industrial end markets. We paid the shareholders of chemagen

$34.6 million

in cash for the stock of chemagen. As of the closing date, we potentially had to pay additional contingent consideration of up to

$20.3 million

, which at closing had an estimated fair value of

$7.7 million

. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

We do not consider the acquisitions completed during

fiscal years 2012 and 2011

, with the exception of the Caliper acquisition, to be material to our consolidated results of operations; therefore, we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for Haoyuan for the period from the acquisition date to

December 30, 2012

were minimal. The aggregate revenue for the acquisitions, with the exception of Caliper, completed during

fiscal year 2011

for the period from their respective acquisition dates to

January 1, 2012

was

$32.4 million

. We have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition.



Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on revenue thresholds or product development milestones achieved through given dates, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period. We may have to pay contingent consideration, related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to

$61.3 million

as of

December 30, 2012

. As of

December 30, 2012

, we had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to our acquisitions of Dexela and Haoyuan, with an estimated fair value of

$3.0 million

. The earnout periods for each of these acquisitions do not exceed

three

years from the acquisition date. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.

In connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. We do not include any costs associated with selling effort, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.

As of

December 30, 2012

, with the exception of the purchase price allocation for the Haoyuan acquisition, the purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in

fiscal years 2012 and 2011

were final. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the Haoyuan acquisition was based upon an initial valuation and our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuation are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period. During the measurement period, we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. Adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements. The effect of any measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price made during the measurement period would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The effects of such adjustments, if material, will cause changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income or expense recognized in prior periods. All changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement period are included in current period earnings.

Contingencies, Including Tax Matters

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued

$6.1 million

as of

December 30, 2012

, which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of the ultimate remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any



additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. We filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In 2007, after the court issued a decision in 2006 regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excluded certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents, summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants. The case was assigned to a new district court judge in January 2009 and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided Enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the “Connecticut Case”), which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of Enzo’s case against us. In March 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. The district court permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants. On September 12, 2012, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. On December 21, 2012, we filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion. The second motion is pending. The district court has permitted Enzo to take limited discovery directed to the motion with briefing to be concluded in May 2013.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above, and we are contesting the action vigorously. While this matter is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Tax years after


remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, such as Singapore, China, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. We make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at

December 30, 2012

should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

We announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2013 that will allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective, affordable and accessible around the world. Our field service for products previously sold by our former Bio-discovery business, as well as our Informatics business, will be moved from our Environmental Health segment into our Human Health segment. We will report our financial results beginning in fiscal year 2013 using this new alignment under our Human Health and Environmental Health segments.

$3.3 million

of revenue in our Human Health segment for

fiscal year 2011

that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. This

increase

in our Human Health segment revenue during

fiscal year 2012

was due primarily to growth in the research market due to continued demand for our in-vivo imaging systems with the addition of Caliper imaging systems, as well as increased demand for our JANUS

®

automation tools and our Operetta

®

cellular imaging systems. The growth in the research market was partially offset by a decline in demand for our suite of radioactive reagents, and reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from reduced research and development spending. We also experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the United States began to stabilize and from continued expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets such as China. In our medical imaging business, we had growth in our traditional diagnostic imaging offerings and continued growth from our therapeutic and non-medical applications, as well as increased demand for our CMOS imaging technology.

and

$0.7 million

for

fiscal year 2010

that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. This increase in our Human Health segment revenue during

fiscal year 2011

was due primarily to increased demand from the adoption of our neonatal and infectious disease screening offerings in the diagnostics market, increased growth for pre-clinical instruments and reagents in the research market, and continued growth from non-medical applications of our imaging technology in our medical imaging business. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower birth rates in the United States and tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market, as well as reduced revenue to pharmaceutical companies resulting from continued customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market and reduced demand for our legacy radioisotope portfolio in the research market.

. In addition to the above, increased sales volume and cost containment and productivity initiatives increased operating income for

fiscal year 2011

, which was partially offset by changes in product mix with growth in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, increased sales and marketing expenses, particularly in emerging territories, and costs related to acquisitions and growth investments in research and development.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and

•

changes in our working capital requirements.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•

increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•

a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,

•

increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,

•

a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•

volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

Cash Flows

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing operations was

$153.6 million

for

fiscal year 2012

, as compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of

$234.0 million

for

fiscal year 2011

, a

decrease

of

$80.4 million

. The cash provided by operating activities for

fiscal year 2012

was principally a result of income from continuing operations of

$68.4 million

, and non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of

$126.9 million

, impairment of assets charge of

$74.2 million

, the expense related to our postretirement benefit plans, including the mark-to-market charge in the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

, of

$35.3 million

, restructuring and contract termination charges, net, of

$25.1 million

, and stock based compensation expense of

$44.6 million

,

an increase

in inventory of

$8.2 million

, and

a decrease

in accounts payable of

$7.9 million

. The

increase

in accounts receivable was a result of higher sales volume during the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

. The

increase

in inventory was primarily a result of realigning operations, research and development resources, and production resources within our Environmental Health and Human Health segments to ensure responsiveness to customer requirements as this realignment occurs. The

decrease

in accounts payable was primarily a result of the timing of disbursements during the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, net,

for

fiscal



year 2011

, a

decrease

of

$443.3 million

. For

fiscal year 2012

, we repurchased

82,186

shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of

$2.1 million

, including commissions. This compares to repurchases of

4.0 million

shares of our common stock, including

84,243

shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of

$435.9 million

. This compares to debt borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of

$787.0 million

and net proceeds of

$496.9 million

from the issuance of our ten-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of

5%

, which was partially offset by debt reductions of

$0.5 million

received during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 from the disposition of property, plant and equipment and

$0.8 million

from the settlement of life insurance policies. Restricted cash balances decreased for

fiscal year 2011

Borrowing Arrangements

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

On December 16, 2011, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility which provides for

$700.0 million

of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of

December 16, 2016

. As of

December 30, 2012

, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of

$12.3 million

were treated as issued and outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of

December 30, 2012

, we had

$429.7 million

available for additional borrowing under the facility. We use the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) one-month Libor plus 1.00%. The Eurocurrency margin as of

December 30, 2012

was


basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of

December 30, 2012

was

0.21%

, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of

1.51%

, which is the interest applicable to borrowings outstanding under the Eurocurrency rate as of

December 30, 2012

. We had

$258.0 million

and

$298.0 million

of borrowings in U.S. Dollars outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of

December 30, 2012

and

January 1, 2012

, respectively, with interest based primarily on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and similar to those contained in the credit agreement for our previous facility. The financial covenants in our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include a debt-to-capital ratio and two contingent covenants, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, applicable if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of

December 30, 2012

.

6%

Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015.

On May 30, 2008, we issued

$150.0 million

aggregate principal amount of 2015 Notes in a private placement and received

$150.0 million

of proceeds from the issuance. The 2015 Notes mature in

May 2015

and bear interest at an annual rate of

6%

. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 30th and November 30th each year. We may redeem some or all of the 2015 Notes at any time, at our option, at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 2015 Notes includes financial covenants of debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent multiple of total debt to earnings ratio, applicable only if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of

December 30, 2012

.

5%

Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021.

On October 25, 2011, we issued

$500.0 million

aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes in a registered public offering and received approximately

$496.9 million

of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2021 Notes were issued at

99.372%

of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of

$3.1 million

. The 2021 Notes mature in

November 2021

and bear interest at an annual rate of

5%

. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th each year. Prior to August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 Notes being redeemed, discounted on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes ) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 Notes below investment grade, each holder of 2021 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holder's 2021 Notes for

101%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of

December 30, 2012

.

Financing Lease Obligations.

In September 2012, we entered into agreements with the lessors of buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. We provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, which resulted in us being considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, we will not be reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. We are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases will qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for us and non-cash investing and financing activities. As a result, we capitalized

$29.3 million

in property and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. In addition, we expect to capitalize additional construction costs, which are not expected to exceed

$15.0 million

, and will be partially funded by the lessors to complete the additions to the buildings. During

fiscal year 2012

, we recorded

$5.5 million

of capital improvements to these buildings, which have been funded by the lessor. The buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing



obligation at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.

Dividends

Our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of

fiscal years 2012 and 2011

, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. On

January 25, 2013

, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of

$0.07

per share that is payable in

May 2013

. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at

December 30, 2012

for continuing and discontinued operations:

____________________________

(1)

The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amount included in this table does not include interest obligations.

(2)

The 2015 Notes, the 2021 Notes, the Financing Lease Obligations, and Other Debt Facilities, include interest obligations.

(3)

As of

December 30, 2012

the 2021 Notes had a carrying value of

$497.2 million

.

(4)

The amount includes accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties. We have excluded

$40.4 million

, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

*    Purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table.

Capital Expenditures

During

fiscal year 2013

, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in

fiscal year 2012

, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures. During

fiscal year 2013

, we also expect to record activity related to capital improvements under our financing lease obligations, which are not expected to exceed

$9.4 million

, and will be partially funded by the lessors.

Other Potential Liquidity Considerations

At

December 30, 2012

, we had cash and cash equivalents of

$171.4 million

and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with

$429.7 million

available for additional borrowing under the facility.

Most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As a result of the Caliper acquisition, we concluded in fiscal year 2011 that certain foreign operations did not require the same level of capital as previously expected, and therefore we planned to repatriate approximately

$350.0 million

of previously unremitted earnings and have provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of those earnings. As a result of the planned repatriation, we recorded an increase to our tax provision of

$79.7 million

in continuing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. We expect to utilize tax attributes, primarily those acquired in the Caliper acquisition, to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation. As of

December 30, 2012

, we had remitted

$229.2 million

of the

$350.0 million

planned repatriation and we expect to remit the remainder of the planned repatriation amount by the end of fiscal year 2013. We expect accumulated non-U.S. cash balances



will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase up to

10.0 million

shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On August 31, 2010, we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase an additional

5.0 million

shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program expired on October 22, 2012. On October 24, 2012, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to

6.0 million

shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "New Repurchase Program"). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 24, 2014 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During

fiscal year 2012

, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under either of the stock repurchase programs. During

fiscal year 2011

, we repurchased approximately

4.0 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$107.8 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During

fiscal year 2010

, we repurchased approximately

3.0 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$71.5 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of

December 30, 2012

, approximately

6.0 million

shares authorized by our Board under the New Repurchase Program remained available for repurchase. From December 31, 2012 through

, we repurchased approximately

2.6 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$89.0 million

, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program.

Our Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans. During

fiscal year 2012

, we repurchased

82,186

shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of

$2.1 million

. During

fiscal year 2011

, we repurchased

84,243

shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of

$2.2 million

. During

fiscal year 2010

, we repurchased

57,551

shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of

$1.3 million

.

The repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding, but remain available to be reissued with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the Repurchase Program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

Distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.

Our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets. During the first quarter of

fiscal year 2013

, we made a contribution of

$37.0 million

for the 2012 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States. With respect to plans outside of the United States, we expect to contribute approximately

$22.0 million

in the aggregate during

fiscal year 2013

, of which we contributed

$10.0 million

to one of our foreign plans during the first quarter of

fiscal year 2013

. We could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. During

fiscal year 2012

, we made a contribution of

$17.0 million

for the 2011 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States, and

$10.9 million

in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the United States. During

fiscal year 2011

, we made contributions of

$11.5 million

in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the United States. We expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.

During the third quarter of

fiscal year 2012

, we entered into a strategic agreement under which we acquired certain intangible assets and received a license to certain core technology for an analytics and data discovery platform, as well as the exclusive right to distribute the platform in certain scientific research and development markets. During

fiscal year 2012

, we paid

$6.8 million

for net intangible assets and

$25.0 million

for prepaid royalties, and expect to pay an additional

$13.2 million

in prepaid royalties within the next year. Royalties are expected to be expensed as revenue is recognized.

Effects of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

During the first quarter of

fiscal year 2012

we adopted new guidance for certain of our health care businesses that recognize patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered where we do not assess the patient's ability to pay at such



time. The new guidance requires us to present the provision for bad debts related to such revenue as a deduction from revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts) on the statements of operations. The effects of the adoption on our consolidated statements of operations were decreases to revenue with corresponding decreases to selling, general and administrative expenses of

$2.8 million

for

fiscal year 2012

,

$2.8 million

for

fiscal year 2011

and

$2.6 million

for

fiscal year 2010

. Accordingly, the financial data for all periods presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of these accounting changes.

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. We believe that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows or do not apply to our operations.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, bad debts, inventories, accounting for business combinations and dispositions, long-lived assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. For revenue that includes customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of our products require specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as services are rendered.

In limited circumstances, we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time, such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component, such as cord blood processing and storage. For these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if such evidence is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, and management's best estimate of selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. TPE is the price of our or any competitor's largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly-situated customers. BESP is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors.

Revenue from software licenses and services was

3%

of our total revenue for

fiscal year 2012

,

2%

of our total revenue for

fiscal year 2011

, and

1%

of our total revenue for

fiscal year 2010

. We sell our software licenses with maintenance services and, in some cases, also with consulting services. For the undelivered elements, we determine VSOE of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine VSOE for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period. We determine VSOE for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved.

We recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and/or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method, provided that the above criteria have been met. If VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established, we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered, or if the only undelivered element is maintenance, then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period.



The majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.

Warranty costs

. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the warranty period.

Allowances for doubtful accounts.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (i) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (ii) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings. Accounts are written-off only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted.

Inventory valuation.

We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.

Business combinations.

Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.

Value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.

We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. We perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. As part of integrating our recent acquisitions, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the PerkinElmer trade name. Accordingly, we



undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of

$74.2 million

in fiscal year 2012. We concluded that the impairment for trade names was not a triggering event for goodwill because the impairment occurred as a result of our decision to phase out certain trade names. We do not believe that our future cash flows will be significantly impacted by these changes. Through

fiscal year 2012

, we assessed the annual impairment testing for our reporting units: analytical sciences and laboratory services, diagnostics, life sciences technology and medical imaging. We completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of

January 2, 2012

and January 3, 2011, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.

Employee compensation and benefits.

We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.

We incurred expenses of

$35.3 million

in

fiscal year 2012

,

$75.0 million

in

fiscal year 2011

and

$3.8 million

in

fiscal year 2010

for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which includes the charge for the mark-to-market adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans, which generally is recorded in the fourth quarter. The expense related to mark-to-market on postretirement benefit plans was

$31.8 million

in

fiscal year 2012

,

$67.9 million

in

fiscal year 2011

and

$0.2 million

in

fiscal year 2010

. We expect expenses of approximately

$0.3 million

in

fiscal year 2013

for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment. It is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in

fiscal year 2013

. Mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. To the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in

fiscal year 2013

. Conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in

fiscal year 2013

. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year.

As of

December 30, 2012

, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the United States to be

7.50%

and to be

5.50%

for all plans outside the United States. In addition, as of

December 30, 2012

we estimate the discount rate for our pension portfolios in the United States to be

3.90%

and to be

3.62%

for all plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date.



If any of our assumptions were to change as of

December 30, 2012

, our pension plan expenses would also change.

We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.

Restructuring activities.

Our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (i) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (ii) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (iii) impairment of assets as discussed above under “Value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges, net.”

Dispositions.

When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the fiscal year ended

December 30, 2012

, we recorded

$2.4 million

in pre-tax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings.

Income taxes.

Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit ("Federal R&D Tax Credit") from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. As a result, we expect our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 will include an approximate

$1.3 million

discrete tax benefit relating to the previously unrecognized Federal R&D Tax Credits from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are



periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.

Additionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including state net operating loss carryforwards, state income tax credit carryforwards, and certain foreign tax attributes. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision.

Taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider indefinitely reinvested, the determination of which is based on our future operational and capital requirements. We continue to maintain our indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and therefore do not accrue U.S. tax for the repatriation of the remaining unremitted foreign earnings. As of

December 30, 2012

, the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the U.S. indefinitely and for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was approximately

$472.0 million

. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of

December 30, 2012

.

We use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only, and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately

60%

of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Therefore, the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business.

In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily denominated in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed


months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings.

Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. We held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling

$64.3 million

at

December 30, 2012

and

$268.9 million

at

January 1, 2012

, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The duration of these contracts was generally


days or less during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

.



As of

December 30, 2012

, we had

two

cash flow hedges outstanding, and as of

January 1, 2012

, we had

no

outstanding cash flow hedges. During the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

, we entered into two forward foreign exchange contracts with settlement dates in

fiscal year 2013

and combined Euro denominated notional amounts of Euro

50.0 million

, designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these currency derivative contracts at

December 30, 2012

was

$0.1 million

. In

May 2008

, we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling

$150.0 million

upon the issuance of our 2015 Notes, and recognized

$8.4 million

, net of taxes of

$5.4 million

, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income. The derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. As of

December 30, 2012

, the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was

$2.9 million

, net of taxes of

$1.9 million

. We amortized

$2.0 million

into interest expense during each of the

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

.

Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk.

The potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately

60%

of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the United States, resulting in natural hedges.

Although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted.

Foreign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk Disclosure

. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a

95%

confidence interval and a holding period of


days. As of

December 30, 2012

, this computation estimated that there is a

5%

chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than

$0.3 million

. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in

fiscal year 2012

, the Value-At-Risk ranged between

$0.2 million

and

$0.5 million

, with an average of approximately

$0.3 million

.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described above, our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures.

In

May 2008

, we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling

$150.0 million

upon the issuance of our 2015 Notes, and recognized

$8.4 million

, net of taxes of

$5.4 million

, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income. The derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. As of

December 30, 2012

, the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was

$2.9 million

, net of taxes of

$1.9 million

. We amortized

$2.0 million

into interest expense during each of the

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

.

Interest Rate Risk—Sensitivity

. As of

December 30, 2012

, our debt portfolio consisted of

$258.0 million

of variable rate debt. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were

$171.4 million

at

December 30, 2012

. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:

(i) Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt, consisting of

$258.0 million

of revolving debt facilities, to fluctuate. An increase of

10%

, or approximately


basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our earnings of

$0.4 million

for

fiscal year 2013

.



(ii) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of

10%

, or approximately


basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by

$0.4 million

for

fiscal year 2013

.

(iii) Changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 30, 2012

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a leading provider of products, services and solutions to the diagnostics, research, environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets. Through its technologies, applications and services critical issues are addressed that help to improve the health and safety of people and their environment. The results are reported within two reporting segments: Human Health and Environmental Health.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company has

two

operating segments; Human Health and Environmental Health. The Company’s Human Health segment concentrates on developing diagnostics, tools and applications to help detect diseases earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies. Within the Human Health segment, the Company serves both the diagnostics and research markets. The Company’s Environmental Health segment provides technologies and applications to facilitate the creation of safer food and consumer products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. The Environmental Health segment serves the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. Each of the fiscal years ended

December 30, 2012

,

January 1, 2012

and

January 2, 2011

included


weeks. The fiscal year ending

December 29, 2013

will also include


weeks.

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from

December 30, 2012

through the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements and has determined that no material subsequent events have occurred that would affect the information presented in these consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Policies and Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company’s product revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. For revenue that includes customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of the Company’s products require specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period, or as services are rendered.

In limited circumstances, the Company has arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time, such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component, such as cord blood processing and storage. For these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if such evidence is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, and management's best estimate of selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. TPE is the price of the Company's or any competitor's largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly-situated customers. BESP is the price at which the Company would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue from software licenses and services was

3%

of the Company's total revenue for

fiscal year 2012

,

2%

of the Company's total revenue for

fiscal year 2011

, and

1%

of the Company's total revenue for

fiscal year 2010

. The Company sells its software licenses with maintenance services and, in some cases, also with consulting services. For the undelivered elements, the Company determines VSOE of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately. The Company determines VSOE for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that will be separately charged for the maintenance renewal period. The Company determines VSOE for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved.

The Company recognizes revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and/or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method, provided that the above criteria have been met. If VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established, the Company defers all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered, or if the only undelivered element is maintenance, then the Company recognizes the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period.

The Company sells products and accessories predominantly through its direct sales force. As a result, the use of distributors is generally limited to geographic regions where the Company has no direct sales force. The Company does not offer product return or exchange rights (other than those relating to defective goods under warranty) or price protection allowances to its customers, including its distributors. Payment terms granted to distributors are the same as those granted to end-user customers and payments are not dependent upon the distributors’ receipt of payment from their end-user customers. Sales incentives related to distributor revenue are also the same as those for end-user customers.

Service revenues represent the Company’s service offerings including service contracts, field service including related time and materials, diagnostic testing, cord blood processing and storage, and training. Service revenues are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues for service and storage contracts are recognized over the contract period.

In July 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-07,

Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities

("ASU No. 2011-07"). ASU No. 2011-07 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for presentation of the provision for bad debts related to certain revenue as a deduction from revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts) on the statements of operations. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 the Company adopted the new guidance for certain of its health care businesses that recognize patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered where the Company does not assess the patient's ability to pay at such time. The effects of the adoption on the Company's consolidated statements of operations resulted in a decrease to revenue and a decrease to selling, general and administrative expenses of

$2.8 million

,

$2.8 million

and

$2.6 million

for the fiscal years ending

December 30, 2012

,

January 1, 2012

and

January 2, 2011

, respectively. Accordingly, the financial data for all periods presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of these accounting changes.

Warranty Costs

:    The Company provides for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the warranty period.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company reports shipping and handling revenue in revenue, to the extent they are billed to customers, and costs in cost of product revenue.

Inventories

:    Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.

Income Taxes:

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely than not. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax for the repatriation of such foreign earnings.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. These reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. See Note 6, below, for additional details.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

The Company depreciates plant and equipment using the straight-line method over its estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings-

10.0

to

40.0

years; leasehold improvements-estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter; machinery and equipment-

3.0

to

7.0

years. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a


-year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Asset Retirement Obligations

:    The Company records obligations associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset-retirement costs in accordance with authoritative guidance on asset retirement obligations. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. The amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are not material to any year presented.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits:

The Company sponsors both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. The Company immediately recognizes actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless the Company is required to perform an interim remeasurement. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis. The Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

For foreign operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as translation gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions considered permanent in nature, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses arising from transactions and translation of period-end balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in earnings.

Business Combinations:

Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.

The Company adjusted the balance sheet amounts at January 1, 2012, where appropriate, to account for the measurement period adjustments related to the Caliper Life Sciences, Inc. (“Caliper”) purchase price allocation discussed in Note 2, below.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

The Company’s intangible assets consist of (i) goodwill, which is not being amortized; (ii) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of certain trademarks and trade names that are not subject to amortization; and (iii) amortizing intangibles, which consist of patents, customer relationships, and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. This annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year, should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Recoverability of amortizing intangible assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to impairment. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their respective fair values. See Note 12, below, for additional details.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense based on estimated grant date fair value, generally using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, as expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period. The determination of fair value and the timing of expense using option pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected forfeiture rate, life of the option and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company estimates the expected forfeiture and expected life assumptions based on historical experience. In determining the Company’s expected stock price volatility assumption, the Company reviews both the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s common stock, with implied volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, the Company has

one

stock-based compensation plan from which it makes grants, which is described more fully in Note 18, below.

Marketable Securities and Investments:

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. If securities are classified as available for sale, the Company records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the cost method of accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, additional investments or distributions.

Cash Flows:

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.

Environmental Matters:

The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.

Research and Development:

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The fair value of acquired IPR&D costs is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the product is ready for sale or expensed if abandoned.

Restructuring Charges:

In recent fiscal years, the Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the alignment with the Company’s growth strategy, the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of its business units. In connection with these initiatives, the Company has recorded restructuring charges, as more fully described in Note 4, below. Generally, costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred. Costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Comprehensive Income:

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05,

Comprehensive Income

(

Topic 220

) as amended, requiring amendments to disclosure for presentation of comprehensive income. This guidance requires presentation of total comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to this guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company early adopted the amended guidance requiring presentation of comprehensive income in two consecutive financial statements for the fiscal year ended

January 1, 2012

. The implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Comprehensive income is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging:

Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms of the contract to the underlying transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive income, unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements. Settled cash flow hedges related to forecasted transactions that remain probable are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and are subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis. As of

December 30, 2012

, the Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with Euro denominated notional amounts of Euro

50.0 million

, and as of

January 1, 2012

, the Company had

no

outstanding cash flow hedges. The Company also has entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective dates. The Company believes that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows or do not apply to the Company's operations.

Business Combinations

Acquisition of Haoyuan Biotech Co., Ltd.

In November 2012, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Shanghai Haoyuan Biotech Co., Ltd. ("Haoyuan"). Haoyuan is a provider of nucleic acid-based blood screening solutions for the blood banking and clinical diagnostics markets. The Company expects this acquisition to extend the Company's capabilities into nucleic acid blood screening, as well as deepen its position in the growing molecular clinical diagnostics market in China. The Company paid the shareholders of Haoyuan

$38.0 million

in cash for the stock of Haoyuan. The Company recorded a receivable of

$2.7 million

from the shareholders of Haoyuan as a reduction of purchase price for the settlement of certain contingencies. As of the closing date, the Company potentially had to pay the shareholders additional contingent consideration of up to

$30.0 million

, which at closing had an estimated fair value of

$1.9 million

. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Human Health segment from the acquisition date.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The total purchase price has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:

The weighted average amortization periods of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets for core technology and trade names were

aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) in a registered public offering and received approximately

$496.9 million

of net proceeds from the issuance, with the remainder of the purchase price paid from available cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company has reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Human Health segment from the acquisition date.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The total purchase price has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:

The weighted average amortization periods of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets were

5.0

years for core technology,

6.0

years for licenses,

7.0

years for customer relationships, and

years for trade names.

Caliper's revenue and pre-tax loss from continuing operations for the period from the acquisition date to

January 1, 2012

were

$29.3 million

and

$3.0 million

, respectively. The following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined financial results for the Company and Caliper as if the acquisition of Caliper had been completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2010:

The unaudited pro forma information for

fiscal years 2011 and 2010

have been calculated after applying the Company's accounting policies and the impact of acquisition date fair value adjustments. The

fiscal year 2011

unaudited pro forma loss from continuing operations was adjusted to exclude approximately

$18.1 million

of acquisition-related transaction costs. In addition, the

fiscal year 2011

unaudited pro forma loss from continuing operations was adjusted to exclude nonrecurring expenses related to the fair value adjustments associated with the acquisition of Caliper that were recorded by the Company related to the completion of this acquisition. The

fiscal year 2010

pro forma income from continuing operations was adjusted to include these acquisition-related transaction costs and the nonrecurring expenses related to the fair value adjustments. These pro forma condensed consolidated financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments, such as fair value adjustment to inventory and deferred revenue, increased interest expense on debt obtained to finance the transaction, and increased amortization for the fair value of acquired intangible assets. The pro forma information



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

does not reflect the effect of costs or synergies that would have been expected to result from the integration of the acquisition. The pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the combination occurred at the beginning of each period presented, or of future results of the consolidated entities.

During fiscal year 2012, the Company obtained information to assist in determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Caliper acquisition date. Based on such information, the Company retrospectively adjusted the fiscal year 2011 comparative information resulting in

an increase

in other current assets of

$20.8 million

,

an increase

in goodwill of

$0.6 million

, and

an increase

in long-term liabilities of

$22.8 million

, offset by

a decrease

in accrued expenses of

$1.4 million

. There were no changes to the previously reported consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows.

Acquisition of Dexela Limited.

In June 2011, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Dexela Limited (“Dexela”).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition to the information provided above for the Caliper acquisition, the components of the fair values of the business combinations and allocations for all other acquisitions completed in

fiscal year 2011

are as follows:

Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, core technology, IPR&D, licenses, and trade names, acquired as part of the acquisitions completed in

fiscal year 2011

had weighted average amortization periods between

7.0

years and

11.0

years. The fair values of stock options assumed were estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair values of unvested stock options as they relate to post-combination services will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses over the remaining service periods, while the fair values of vested stock options as they relate to pre-combination services are included in the purchase price of the acquired entity.

The Company does not consider the acquisitions completed during

fiscal years 2012 and 2011

, with the exception of the Caliper acquisition, to be material to its consolidated results of operations; therefore, the Company is not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for Haoyuan for the period from the acquisition date to

December 30, 2012

were minimal. The aggregate revenue for the acquisitions, with the exception of Caliper, completed during

fiscal year 2011

for the period from their respective acquisition dates to

January 1, 2012

was

$32.4 million

. The Company has also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition.

As of

December 30, 2012

, with the exception of the purchase price allocation for the Haoyuan acquisition, the purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were final. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the Haoyuan acquisition was based upon an initial valuation and the Company's estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuation are subject to change within the measurement period (up to

one

year from the acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period. During the measurement period, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. Adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements. The effect of adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price made during the measurement period would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The effects of any such adjustments, if material, will cause changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income or expense recognized in prior periods. All changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement period are included in current period earnings.

Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period. The Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to

$61.3 million

as of

December 30, 2012

. As of

December 30, 2012

, the Company had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to its acquisitions of Dexela and Haoyuan, with an estimated fair value of

$3.0 million

. The earnout periods for each of these acquisitions do not exceed

three

years from the acquisition date. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets. or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.

In connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions, the Company estimates the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with its acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. The Company does not include any costs associated with selling effort, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that the Company would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.

Total transaction costs related to acquisition activities for

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

were

$1.2 million

,

$10.7 million

and

$2.6 million

, respectively. These transaction costs were expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Note 3:

Discontinued Operations

As part of the Company’s continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses. The Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of

December 30, 2012

and

January 1, 2012

.

, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of its IDS business. During fiscal year 2011, the Company updated the net working capital adjustment associated with the sale of this business and other potential contingencies, which resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax loss of

$1.8 million

. These gains and losses were recognized as gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations.

In December 2008, the Company’s management approved a plan to divest its Photoflash business within the Environmental Health segment. In June 2010, the Company sold the Photoflash business for

$13.5 million

, including an adjustment for net working capital, plus potential additional contingent consideration. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of

$4.4 million

, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale. During the fiscal year 2012, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of

$2.5 million

for contingent consideration related to this sale. These gains were recognized as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations.

During

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

, the Company settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations. The Company recognized a pre-tax

gain

of

$3.9 million

in

provision

of

$0.9 million

on discontinued operations in

fiscal year 2012

, a tax

benefit

of

$4.5 million

on discontinued operations in

fiscal year 2011

and a tax

provision

of

$96.6 million

in

fiscal year 2010

on discontinued operations. The recognition of

$4.5 million

income tax benefit in

fiscal year 2011

is primarily the net result of a change in estimate related to the federal income tax liability associated with the repatriation of the unremitted earnings of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, as further described in Note 6, below, offset by the tax provision on the contingent consideration received in fiscal year 2011 related to the sale of the Company's semiconductor business in fiscal year 2006. The recognition of

$96.6 million

income tax expense in

fiscal year 2010

includes

$16.0 million

of income tax expense associated with unremitted earnings of directly-owned foreign subsidiaries that no longer qualified as indefinitely reinvested once the subsidiary was held for sale, and

$65.8 million

related to the federal income tax liability associated with the repatriation of the unremitted earnings of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, as further described in Note 6, below.

Previous Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years 2001 through 2010 were workforce reductions related to the integration of the Company’s businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. During

fiscal year 2012

, the Company paid

$4.0 million

related to these plans and recorded an additional

charge

of

$0.2 million

related to higher than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in Europe within the Human Health segment, as well as a

reversal

of

$0.7 million

primarily related to a reduction in the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in Europe within the Environmental Health segment. As of

December 30, 2012

, the Company had approximately

$10.0 million

of remaining liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans, primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities and remaining severance payments for workforce reductions in both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments. The Company expects to make payments for these leases, the terms of which vary in length, through fiscal year 2022.

Contract Termination Charges

The Company has terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and has recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to the Company. The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of

$1.5 million

in

fiscal year 2012

, a pre-tax charge of

$2.0 million

in

fiscal year 2011

and a pre-tax charge of

$0.1 million

in

fiscal year 2010

primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in the Environmental Health segment. The Company made payments for these obligations of

$2.9 million

during

fiscal year 2012

,

$0.4 million

during

fiscal year 2011

, and

$1.7 million

during

fiscal year 2010

. The remaining balance of these accruals as of

December 30, 2012

was

$0.6 million

.

Note 5:

Interest and Other Expense (Income), Net

Interest and other expense (income), net, consisted of the following for the fiscal years ended:

In fiscal year 2010, the Company acquired the remaining

fifty

percent equity interest in its joint venture (the "ICPMS Joint Venture") with the company previously known as MDS, Inc. for the development and manufacturing of the Company's Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry product line. The fair value of the acquisition was

$67.7 million

, including cash consideration of

$35.0 million

, non-cash consideration of

$2.6 million

for certain non-exclusive rights to intangible assets the Company owns, and

$30.4 million

representing the fair value of its

fifty

percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture held prior to the acquisition. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of

$25.6 million

from the re-measurement to fair value of its previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture.

Note 6:

Income Taxes

The Company regularly reviews its tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits. The Company makes adjustments to its unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

The Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At

December 30, 2012

, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of approximately

$7.9 million

and

$4.0 million

, respectively. During

fiscal year 2012

, the Company recognized a charge of approximately

$1.1 million

for interest and a benefit of

$2.2 million

for penalties in its total tax provision. During

fiscal year 2011

, the Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately

$0.5 million

and

zero

, respectively, in its total tax provision. During fiscal year 2010, the Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately

$0.8 million

and

$0.9 million

, respectively, in its total tax provision. At

December 30, 2012

, the Company had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of

$58.1 million

, of which

$51.1 million

, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect discontinued operations.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that

$13.2 million

of its uncertain tax positions at

December 30, 2012

, including accrued interest and penalties, and net of tax benefits, may be recognized within the next year as a result of an aggregate

$8.4 million

lapse in the statute of limitations and settlements of

$4.8 million

. Tax years after


remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations, such as Singapore, China, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction.

The components of (loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows for the fiscal years ended:

As a result of the sale of the IDS and Photoflash businesses in fiscal year 2010, the Company concluded that the remaining operations within those foreign subsidiaries previously containing IDS and Photoflash operations did not require the same level of capital as previously required, and therefore the Company planned to repatriate approximately

$250.0 million

of previously unremitted earnings and provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of those earnings. The impact of this tax provision in fiscal year 2010 was an increase to the Company’s tax provision of

$65.8 million

in discontinued operations. The Company utilized existing tax attributes to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation. As of January 1, 2012, the Company had completed the repatriation of the previously unremitted earnings of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, and reduced its estimated tax liability associated with the repatriation by approximately

$6.7 million

. This change in estimate was recorded as a credit to discontinued operations during fiscal year 2011.

As a result of the Caliper acquisition, the Company concluded in fiscal year 2011 that certain foreign operations did not require the same level of capital as previously expected, and therefore the Company planned to repatriate approximately

$350.0 million

of previously unremitted earnings and has provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of those earnings. As a result of the planned repatriation, the Company recorded an increase to the Company’s tax provision of

$79.7 million

in continuing operations in fiscal year 2011. The Company expects to utilize tax attributes, primarily those acquired in the Caliper acquisition, to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation. As of

December 30, 2012

, the Company had remitted

$229.2 million

of the

$350.0 million

planned repatriation.

Taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that the Company continues to consider indefinitely reinvested, the determination of which is based on its future operational and capital requirements. The Company continues to maintain its indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore does not accrue U.S. tax for the repatriation of its remaining unremitted foreign earnings. As of

December 30, 2012

, the amount of foreign earnings that the Company has the intent and ability to keep invested outside the U.S. indefinitely and for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was approximately

$472.0 million

. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.

Note 7:

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations for the fiscal years ended:

Antidilutive securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share and could become dilutive in the future.

Note 12:

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

The Company tests goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually for possible impairment. Accordingly, the Company completes the annual testing of impairment for goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. In addition to its annual test, the Company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or non-amortizing intangible assets.

The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company performed its annual impairment testing for its reporting units as of

January 2, 2012

, its annual impairment date for

fiscal year 2012

, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. The fair values of each of the Company's reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.

The Company has consistently employed the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate and working capital changes. Cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years. The income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. The long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with the Company’s historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect the long-term terminal growth rates of the Company. The long-term terminal growth rates for the Company’s reporting units ranged from

4.0%

to

6.0%

for the

fiscal year 2012

impairment analysis. The range for the discount rates for the reporting units was

10.5%

to

12.0%

. Keeping all other variables constant, a

10.0%

change in any one of the input assumptions for the various reporting units would still allow the Company to conclude, based on the first step of the process, that there was no impairment of goodwill.

The Company has consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, the Company currently evaluates the remaining useful life of its non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. The Company performed its annual impairment testing as of

January 2, 2012

, and concluded that there was no impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets. An assessment of the recoverability of amortizing intangible assets takes place when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As part of integrating the Company's recent acquisitions, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company decided that prospectively it would primarily focus on the PerkinElmer trade name. Accordingly, the Company undertook a review of certain of its trade names within its portfolio as part of a realignment of its marketing strategy. The process resulted in the Company determining that the lives of certain trade names that it intends to phase out should be shortened, and in certain cases non-amortizing trade names were determined to no longer be indefinite-lived. Accordingly, the Company tested the recoverability of these identified indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangibles and concluded that the fair values of certain trade name intangible assets were less than the carrying amounts of those assets. For non-amortizing trade names the Company compared the fair values, which was determined using a relief from royalty method, to the carrying values, considering the revised useful lives. For amortizing trade names, the Company first determined if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the intangibles exceeded the carrying values. If the undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying values, the Company determined the fair values of the trade names using a relief from royalty method, considering the revised useful lives. The remaining adjusted fair values of

$6.1 million

are being amortized over the period of time until the trade names are expected to be phased out, having weighted average remaining useful lives of

3.0

years.

As a result, during the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of

$74.2 million

which was equal to the excess of the carrying amounts of the intangible assets over the fair value of such assets. The Company recognized

$54.3 million

pre-tax impairment charges in the Human Health segment and also recognized

$19.9 million

pre-tax impairment charges in the Environmental Health segment. The Company recorded a charge of

$3.0 million

for the impairment of intangible assets during

fiscal year 2011

within the Human Health segment for the full impairment of license agreements, that the Company no longer intends to use. There were

no

impairment charges during

fiscal year 2010

. These non-cash impairments of intangible assets have been recorded as a separate component of operating expenses.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for

fiscal years 2012 and 2011

are as follows, (the

, the Company paid

$6.8 million

for net intangible assets and

$25.0 million

for prepaid royalties, and expects to pay an additional

$13.2 million

in prepaid royalties within the next year. Royalties are expected to be expensed as revenue is recognized. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company has reported the amortization of these intangible assets within the results of the Company's Human Health segment from the execution date.

Debt

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

On December 16, 2011, the Company entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility which provides for

$700.0 million

of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of

December 16, 2016

. As of

December 30, 2012

, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of

$12.3 million

were treated as issued and outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of

December 30, 2012

, the Company had

$429.7 million

available for additional borrowing under the facility. The Company uses the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) one-month Libor plus 1.00%. The Eurocurrency margin as of

December 30, 2012

was

December 30, 2012

was

0.21%

, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of

1.51%

and

January 1, 2012

, the Company had

$258.0 million

and

$298.0 million

, respectively of borrowings in U.S. Dollars outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility with interest based primarily on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and similar to those contained in the Company's credit agreement for its previous facility. The financial covenants in the Company's amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include a debt-to-capital ratio and two contingent covenants, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, applicable if the Company's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade.

6%

Senior Unsecured Notes due 2015.

On May 30, 2008, the Company issued

$150.0 million

aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) in a private placement and received

$150.0 million

of proceeds from the issuance. The 2015 Notes mature in

May 2015

and bear interest at an annual rate of

6%

. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 30th and November 30th each year. The Company may redeem some or all of the 2015 Notes at any time, at its option, at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the 2015 Notes includes financial covenants of debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent multiple of total debt to earnings ratio, applicable only if the Company's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade.

5%

Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021.

On October 25, 2011, the Company issued

$500.0 million

aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes in a registered public offering and received approximately

$496.9 million

of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2021 Notes were issued at

99.372%

of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of

$3.1 million

. The 2021 Notes mature in

November 2021

and bear interest at an annual rate of

5%

. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th each year. Prior to August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 Notes being redeemed, discounted on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2021 Notes, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes ) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 Notes below investment grade, each holder of 2021 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase such holder's 2021 Notes for

101%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Financing Lease Obligations.

In September 2012, the Company entered into agreements with the lessors of buildings that the Company is currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. The Company provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, which resulted in the Company being considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, the Company will not be reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. The Company is therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases will qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for the Company and non-cash investing and financing activities. As a result, the Company capitalized

$29.3 million

in property and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. In addition, the Company expects to capitalize additional construction costs, which are not expected to exceed

$15.0 million

, and will be partially funded by the lessors to complete the additions to the buildings. During

fiscal year 2012

, the Company recorded

$5.5 million

of capital improvements to these buildings, which have been funded by the lessor. The buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.

Assets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocations as of

December 30, 2012

and

January 1, 2012

, and target asset allocations for the

fiscal year 2013

are as follows:

The Company maintains target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments.

The Company’s expected returns on assets assumptions are derived from management’s estimates, as well as other information compiled by management, including studies that utilize customary procedures and techniques. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.

The Company's discount rate assumptions are derived from a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on high-quality fixed-income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and the related expected duration for the obligations.

The target allocations for plan assets are listed in the above table. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and mid-cap companies located in the United States and abroad, and equity index funds. Debt securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, high-yield bonds, and U.S. government securities. Other types of investments include investments in non U.S. government index liked bonds, multi-strategy hedge funds and venture capital funds that follow several different strategies.

Valuation Techniques:

Valuation techniques utilized need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There have been no changes in the methodologies utilized at

December 30, 2012

compared to

January 1, 2012

. The following is a description of the valuation techniques utilized to measure the fair value of the assets shown in the table above.

Equity Securities:

Shares of registered investment companies that are publicly traded are categorized as Level 1assets; they are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of the fund. These instruments have active markets.

Equity index funds are mutual funds that are not publicly traded and are comprised primarily of underlying equity securities that are publicly traded on exchanges. Price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily observable and available. Equity index funds are categorized as Level 2 assets.

Fixed Income Securities:

Fixed income mutual funds that are publicly traded are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of securities held by the fund and are categorized as Level 1 assets.

Fixed income index funds that are not publicly traded are stated at net asset value as determined by the issuer of the fund based on the fair value of the underlying investments and are categorized as Level 2 assets.

Individual fixed income bonds are categorized as Level 2 assets except where sufficient quoted prices exist in active markets, in which case such securities are categorized as Level 1 assets. These securities are valued using third-party pricing services. These services may use, for example, model-based pricing methods that utilize observable market data as inputs. Broker dealer bids or quotes of securities with similar characteristics may also be used.

Other Types of Investments:

Non U.S. government index link bond funds are not publicly traded and are stated at net asset value as determined by the issuer of the fund based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Underlying investments consist of bonds in which payment of income on the principal is related to a specific price index and are categorized as Level 2 assets.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Hedge funds and venture capital funds are limited partnerships that are at estimated fair value based on their proportionate share of the partnership fair value. The partnerships invest primarily in readily available marketable securities. The partnerships allocate gains, losses, and expense to the investor based on the ownership percentage as described in the fund agreements. They are categorized as Level 3 assets.

The Company's policy is to recognize significant transfers between levels at the actual date of the event.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 assets for

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

is as follows:

During the first quarter of

fiscal year 2013

, the Company contributed

$37.0 million

to the U.S. pension plan. With respect to non-U.S. plans, the Company expects to contribute approximately

$22.0 million

in

fiscal year 2013

, of which the Company contributed

$10.0 million

to one of its foreign plans during the first quarter of

fiscal year 2013

.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

The Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At

Postretirement Medical Plans:

The Company provides healthcare benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. Eligible U.S. employees qualify for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities and are available only to pay retiree health benefits.

These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to

ten

years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that the Company breached its distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo's patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo's patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. The Company filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo's patents are invalid. In 2007, after the court issued a decision in 2006 regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo's patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, the Company believes, excluded certain of the Company's products from the coverage of Enzo's patents, summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants. The case was assigned to a new district court judge in January 2009 and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided Enzo's appeal of the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the “Connecticut Case”), which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of Enzo's case against the Company. In March 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. The district court permitted the Company and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants. On September 12, 2012, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. On December 21, 2012, the Company filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion. The second motion is pending. The district court has permitted Enzo to take limited discovery directed to the motion with briefing to be concluded in May 2013.

The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the matter described above, and it is contesting the action vigorously. While this matter is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at

December 30, 2012

should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.

Note 17:

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for certain products usually for a period of

one

year beyond the date of sale. The majority of costs associated with warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the time for service personnel to respond to repair and replacement requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical results, supplemented by management’s expectations of future costs. Warranty reserves are included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.

Stock Plans

Stock-Based Compensation:

In addition to the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company utilizes

one

stock-based compensation plan, the 2009 Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). Under the 2009 Plan,

10.0 million

shares of the Company’s common stock, as well as shares of the Company’s common stock previously granted under the Amended and Restated 2001 Incentive Plan and the 2005 Incentive Plan that were cancelled or forfeited without the shares being issued, are authorized for stock option grants, restricted stock awards, and stock grants as part of the Company’s compensation programs (the “Plan”).

The following table summarizes total pre-tax compensation expense recognized related to the Company’s stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock grants, net of estimated forfeitures, included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

:

The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation was

$6.8 million

in

fiscal year 2012

,

$5.1 million

in

fiscal year 2011

and

$4.7 million

in

fiscal year 2010

. Stock-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were

$0.3 million

as of both

December 30, 2012

and

January 1, 2012

. The excess tax benefit recognized from stock awards, classified as a financing cash activity, was

$1.8 million

in

fiscal year 2012

,

$9.3 million

in

fiscal year 2011

and

$2.4 million

in

fiscal year 2010

.

Stock Options:

The Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of

three

years, and will generally expire

seven

years after the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

date of grant. Options replaced in association with business combination transactions are issued with the same terms of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated primarily based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic exercise experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the fiscal years ended:

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the three fiscal years ended

December 30, 2012

:

The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding at

December 30, 2012

3.8

years. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercisable at

December 30, 2012

was

$28.5 million

with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of

2.7

years. At

December 30, 2012

, there were

4.1 million

stock options that were vested, and expected to vest in the future, with an aggregate intrinsic value of

$37.1 million

and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of

3.8

years.

The weighted-average per-share grant-date fair value of options granted during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

was

$7.36

,

$7.03

, and

$5.99

, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

in

fiscal year 2010

.

There was

$6.7 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock options granted as of

December 30, 2012

. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.8

years, and will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Restricted Stock Awards:

The Company has awarded shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees at no cost to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction period. The restricted stock and restricted stock units vest through the passage of time, assuming continued employment. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses over the vesting period, which is generally

three

years. These awards were granted under the Company’s 2009 Plan, 2005



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Incentive Plan and 2001 Incentive Plan. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.

The following table summarizes restricted stock award activity for the three fiscal years ended

December 30, 2012

:

The weighted-average per-share grant-date fair value of restricted stock awards granted during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

was

$25.86

,

$26.31

, and

$21.20

, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock awards vested during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

was

$4.3 million

in

fiscal year 2010

.

As of

December 30, 2012

, there was

$9.2 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.3

fiscal years.

Performance Units:

The Company’s performance unit program provides a cash award based on the achievement of specific performance criteria. A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three-year performance period. The number of units earned at the end of the performance period is determined by multiplying the number of units granted by a performance factor ranging from

0%

to

200%

. Awards are determined by multiplying the number of units earned by the stock price at the end of the performance period, and are paid in cash and accounted for as a liability based award. The compensation expense associated with these units is recognized over the period that the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The Company granted

122,675

performance units,

89,828

performance units, and

129,879

performance units during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

, respectively. The weighted-average per-share grant-date fair value of performance units granted during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

was

$26.18

,

$26.71

, and

$20.89

, respectively. The total compensation expense related to these performance units was

$7.1 million

,

$3.7 million

, and

$2.0 million

for

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

, respectively. As of

December 30, 2012

, there were

322,516

performance units outstanding subject to forfeiture, with a corresponding liability of

$10.4 million

recorded in accrued expenses and long-term liabilities.

Stock Awards:

The Company’s stock award program provides non-employee Directors an annual equity award. For

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

the award equaled the number of shares of the Company’s common stock which has an aggregate fair market value of

$100,000

on the date of the award. The stock award is prorated for non-employee Directors who serve for only a portion of the year. The shares are granted in May following the annual meeting of shareholders, on the third business day after the Company’s first quarter earnings release. The compensation expense associated with these stock awards is recognized when the stock award is granted. In

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

, each non-employee Director was awarded

4,535

shares,

3,544

shares, and

4,337

shares, respectively. The weighted-average per-share grant-date fair value of stock awards granted during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

was

$27.87

,

$28.22

, and

$23.06

, respectively. The total compensation expense recognized related to these stock awards was

$0.7 million

in

fiscal year 2012

and

$0.8 million

in

fiscal years 2011 and 2010

.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

In April 1999, the Company’s shareholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating employees have the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to

95%

of the closing price on the last day of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed

10%

of the employee’s base compensation. During

fiscal year 2012

, the Company issued

53,961

shares of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted-average price of

$24.51

per share. During

fiscal year 2011

, the Company issued

102,970

shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of

$21.33

per share. During

fiscal year 2010

, the Company issued

85,607

shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of

$21.80

per share. At

1.2 million

shares of the Company’s common stock out of the

5.0 million

shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under this plan.

Note 19:

Stockholders’ Equity

Comprehensive Income (Loss):

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the following:

Stock Repurchase Program:

On October 23, 2008, the Company announced that the Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized the Company to repurchase up to

10.0 million

shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On August 31, 2010, the Company announced that the Board had authorized the Company to repurchase an additional

5.0 million

shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program expired on October 22, 2012. On October 24, 2012, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to

6.0 million

shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "New Repurchase Program"). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 24, 2014 unless terminated earlier by the Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During

fiscal year 2012

, the Company did

no

t repurchase any shares of common stock under either of the stock repurchase programs. During

fiscal year 2011

, the Company repurchased approximately

4.0 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$107.8 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During

fiscal year 2010

, the Company repurchased approximately

3.0 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$71.5 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of

December 30, 2012

6.0 million

shares authorized by the Board under the New Repurchase Program remained available f

or repurchase. From December 31, 2012 through

February 22, 2013

, the Company repurchased approximately

2.6 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$89.0 million

, including commissions, under the New Repurchase

Program.

The Board has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans. During

fiscal year 2012

, the Company repurchased

82,186

shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of

$2.1 million

. During

fiscal year 2011

$1.3 million

. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

Dividends:

The Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of

$0.07

per share in each quarter of

fiscal year 2012

and in each quarter of

fiscal year 2011

. At

December 30, 2012

, the Company has accrued

$8.0 million

for dividends declared prior to year end payable in

February 2013

. On

January 25, 2013

, the Company announced that the Board had declared a quarterly dividend of

$0.07

per share that will be payable in

May 2013

. In the future, the Board may determine to reduce or eliminate the Company’s common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.



Note 20:

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and has policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately

60%

of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. The fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed

12 months

, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings.

Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling

$64.3 million

at

December 30, 2012

and

$268.9 million

at

January 1, 2012

, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally


days or less during

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

.

During the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

, the Company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts with settlement dates in

fiscal year 2013

and combined Euro denominated notional amounts of Euro

50.0 million

, designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these currency derivative contracts at

December 30, 2012

was

$0.1 million

. In

May 2008

, the Company settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling

$150.0 million

upon the issuance of its 2015 Notes, and recognized

$8.4 million

, net of taxes of

$5.4 million

, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income. The derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. As of

December 30, 2012

, the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was

$2.9 million

, net of taxes of

$1.9 million

. The Company amortized

$2.0 million

into interest expense during each of the

fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010

.

Note 21:

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of

December 30, 2012

.

The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during

fiscal years 2012 and 2011

. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of marketable securities, derivative contracts used to hedge the Company’s currency risk, and acquisition related contingent consideration. The Company has not elected to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value.

Valuation Hierarchy:

The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required to measure fair value. For Level 1 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices as these instruments have active markets. For Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or utilizes alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. For Level 3 inputs, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based on the best information available, including estimates by management primarily based on information provided by third-party fund managers, independent brokerage firms and insurance companies. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following tables show the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of

December 30, 2012

and

January 1, 2012

classified in one of the three classifications described above:

Valuation Techniques:

The Company’s Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities are comprised of investments in equity and fixed-income securities as well as derivative contracts. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including common stock price quotes, foreign exchange forward prices, and bank price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities.

Marketable securities:

Include equity and fixed-income securities measured at fair value using the quoted market prices at the reporting date.

Foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities:

Include foreign exchange derivative contracts that are valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date.

The Company has classified its net liabilities for contingent consideration relating to its acquisitions of chemagen, Biopolymer-Technologie AG, ArtusLabs, Inc., ID Biological Systems, Inc., Dexela Limited and Haoyuan within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs, which included probability weighted cash flows. A description of these acquisitions is included within Note 2. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period. The Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to

$61.3 million

as of

December 30, 2012

. As of

December 30, 2012

, the Company had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to its acquisitions of Dexela and Haoyuan, with an estimated fair value of

$3.0 million

. The earnout periods for each of these acquisitions do not exceed

three

years from the acquisition date.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 net liabilities is as follows:

During the fourth quarter of

fiscal year 2012

, the Company recorded

$74.2 million

of pre-tax intangible asset impairment charges related to certain trade names. A description of these impairment charges is included within Note 12. The fair value measurements were determined using a relief from royalty method, which incorporates unobservable inputs, thereby classifying the fair value measurements as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The primary inputs used in the relief from royalty method, an income-based approach, included estimated prospective cash flows considering the revised useful lives and an estimated royalty rate that would be used by a market participant. The royalty rates ranged from

0.5%

to

1.0%

, the discount rates ranged from

11.0%

to

12.0%

, and the useful lives ranged from

1.0

to

8.0

years. The identified indefinite-lived intangibles related to the above impairment charges, had a carrying value of

$76.4 million

and a fair value of

$4.5 million

as of the impairment date, resulting in an impairment loss of

$71.9 million

. The identified definite-lived intangibles related to the above impairment charges, had a carrying value of

$3.8 million

and a fair value of

$1.5 million

as of the impairment date, resulting in an impairment loss of

$2.3 million

.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. If measured at fair value, cash and cash equivalents would be classified as Level 1.

The Company’s senior unsecured revolving credit facility, with a

$700.0 million

available limit, had amounts outstanding of

$258.0 million

and

$298.0 million

as of

December 30, 2012

and

January 1, 2012

, respectively. The interest rate on the Company’s senior unsecured revolving credit facility is reset at least monthly to correspond to variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. The Company had no change in credit standing during

fiscal year 2012

. Consequently, the carrying value of the current year and prior year credit facilities approximate fair value and would be classified as Level 2.

The Company’s 2015 Notes, with a face value of

$150.0 million

, had an aggregate carrying value of

$150.0 million

and a fair value of

$165.4 million

as of

December 30, 2012

. The 2015 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of

$150.0 million

and a fair value of

$165.7 million

as of

January 1, 2012

. The Company's 2021 Notes, with a face value of

$500.0 million

, had an aggregate carrying value of

$497.2 million

, net of

$2.8 million

of unamortized original issue discount, and a fair value of

$558.3 million

as of

December 30, 2012

. The 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of

$496.9 million

, net of

$3.1 million

of unamortized original issue discount, and a fair value of

$518.3 million

as of

January 1, 2012

. The fair values of the 2015 Notes and the 2021 Notes are estimated using market quotes from brokers, or are based on current rates offered for similar debt. The Company's financing lease obligations had an aggregate carrying value of

$34.6 million

as of

December 30, 2012

and approximated the fair value given the timing of the recognition of these obligations to the balance sheet date. As of

December 30, 2012

, the 2015 Notes, 2021 Notes and financing lease obligations were classified as Level 2.

As of

December 30, 2012

, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities due to credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to the Company’s derivative assets based on the evaluation of its counterparties’ credit risks.

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information

The Company discloses information about its operating segments based on the way that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and operating income. Intersegment revenue and transfers are not significant. The Company’s management reviews the results of the Company’s operations by the Human Health and Environmental Health operating segments. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1. The principal products and services of these operating segments are:

•

Human Health

.    Develops diagnostics, tools and applications to help detect diseases earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies. The Human Health segment serves both the diagnostics and research markets.

•

Environmental Health

.    Provides technologies and applications to facilitate the creation of safer food and consumer products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. The Environmental Health segment serves the environmental, industrial and laboratory services markets.

The Company has included the expenses for its corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the expense related to mark-to-market on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. The Company has a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in the Company’s calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of the Company’s operating segments.

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

December 30, 2012

. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

December 30, 2012

, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 30, 2012

. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.



Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of

December 30, 2012

, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 30, 2012

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 30, 2012

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended

December 30, 2012

of the Company and our report dated

February 26, 2013

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
