PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

We are a leading provider of products, services and solutions for the diagnostics, food, environmental, industrial, life sciences research and laboratory services markets. Through our advanced technologies and differentiated solutions, we address critical issues that help to improve lives and the world around us.

We realigned our businesses at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to better organize around customer requirements, positioning us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings. We created two new reporting segments, Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics, which will enable us to deliver improved customer focus, more value-add collaboration and breakthrough innovations. Our Diagnostics business became a standalone reporting segment targeted towards better meeting the needs of clinically-oriented customers, especially within the growing areas of reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and applied genomics. Microfluidics and automation products within our former research business were moved to a new applied genomics group within the Diagnostics segment. Our former environmental health business and the remaining products within the legacy research business were combined to form our new Discovery & Analytical Solutions reporting segment, focused on better serving and innovating for applications-oriented customers. Discovery & Analytical Solutions customers span the environmental, food, industrial, life sciences research and laboratory services markets.

We are a Massachusetts corporation, founded in 1947. Our headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, and we market our products and services in more than


countries. As of

January 1, 2017

, we employed approximately

8,000

employees in our continuing operations. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PKI” and we are a component of the S&P 500 Index.

We maintain a website with the address

http://www.perkinelmer.com

. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Our Strategy

Our strategy is to develop and deliver innovative products, services and solutions in high-growth markets that utilize our knowledge and expertise to address customers’ critical needs and drive scientific breakthroughs. To execute on our strategy and accelerate revenue growth, we focus on broadening our offerings through both the acquisition of innovative technology and investment in research and development. Our strategy includes:

Attracting, retaining and developing talented and engaged employees.

Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently taken the following actions:

Strategic Business Realignment:

We realigned our businesses at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to better organize around customer requirements, positioning us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings. We created two new operating segments, Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics, which will enable us to deliver improved customer focus, more value-add collaboration and breakthrough innovations. The results reported for

fiscal year 2016

reflect this new alignment of our operating segments. Financial information in this report relating to

fiscal years 2015 and 2014

has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to our operating segments.

Acquisitions in Fiscal Year 2016:



We completed the acquisition of two businesses in fiscal year 2016 for a total consideration of

$72.2 million

in cash.  The acquired businesses were Bioo Scientific Corporation, which was acquired for total consideration of

$63.5 million

in cash and one other business acquired for a total consideration of

$8.8 million

in cash. We reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions segments from the acquisition dates.

Restructuring:

During

fiscal year 2016

, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of

$0.6 million

in our Diagnostics segment and

$5.9 million

in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment related to a workforce reduction from restructuring activities. Our management approved these plans principally to focus resources on higher growth product lines and end markets. We also recorded pre-tax restructuring reversals of

$0.3 million

in our Diagnostics segment and

$1.2 million

in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions. This pre-tax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of income from continuing operations. We expect no significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in

fiscal year 2016

.

As part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following actions:

Share Repurchase Program:

On October 23, 2014, our Board of Directors (our "Board") authorized us to repurchase up to

8.0 million

shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program").  On July 27, 2016, our Board authorized us to immediately terminate the Repurchase Program and further authorized us to repurchase up to 8.0 million shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "New Repurchase Program"). The New Repurchase Program will expire on July 26, 2018 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the

fiscal year 2016

, we repurchased

3.2 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$148.2 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. No shares remain available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program due to its cancellation. As of

January 1, 2017

,

8.0 million

shares remained available for repurchase under the New Repurchase Program. From January 2, 2017 through

February 24, 2017

, there were no stock repurchases under the New Repurchase Program.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces. As of

January 1, 2017

, we employed approximately

3,700

sales and service representatives operating in approximately


countries and marketing products and services in more than


countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names,



and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Due to the range and diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. Our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market positions. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were

$124.3 million

during

fiscal year 2016

,

$112.5 million

during

fiscal year 2015

, and

$108.1 million

during

fiscal year 2014

.

We have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs. To accelerate our growth initiatives, we directed our research and development efforts in

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

primarily toward our Diagnostics segment, and the environmental, food, life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during

fiscal year 2017

, and to continue to emphasize the Diagnostics segment, and the environmental, food, life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued

$9.9 million

and

$11.8 million

as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not



include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. During fiscal year 2014, we recorded a benefit of

$2.3 million

for cost reimbursements related to a particular site, of which

$1.2 million

was for future monitoring and mitigation activities. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of

January 1, 2017

, we employed approximately

8,000

employees in our continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As of

January 1, 2017

, we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately

1,700

union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Business Segments

The results reported for fiscal year 2016 reflect the new alignment of our operating segments and the placement of our Medical Imaging business into discontinued operations due to its pending sale. Financial information in the table below relating to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect both our new segment structure and the exclusion of our Medical Imaging business from continuing operations.

We have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.



The table below sets forth revenue and operating income (loss) from continuing operations by operating segment for the fiscal years ended:

____________________________

(1)

Legal costs for a particular case in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment were

$0.8 million

for

fiscal year 2015

.

(2)

Activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans has been included in the Corporate operating loss from continuing operations, and in the aggregate constituted a pre-tax

loss

of

$15.3 million

in

fiscal year 2016

, a pre-tax

loss

of

$12.4 million

in

fiscal year 2015

, and pre-tax

loss

of

$75.4 million

in

fiscal year 2014

.

(3)

Includes expenses related to litigation with Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”). Enzo filed a complaint in 2002 that alleged that we separately and together with other defendants breached distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo's patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo's patented products and technology. We entered into a settlement agreement with Enzo dated June 20, 2014 and during fiscal year 2014 paid

$7.0 million

into a designated escrow account to resolve this matter, of which

$3.7 million

had been accrued in previous years and

$3.3 million

was recorded during fiscal year 2014. In addition,

$3.4 million

of expenses were incurred and recorded in preparation for the trial during fiscal year 2014.

Discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table.

Additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows for the fiscal years ended:



Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During

fiscal year 2016

, we had

$1,273.2 million

in sales from our international operations, representing approximately

60%

of our total sales. During

fiscal year 2016

, we derived approximately

75%

of our international sales from our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment and approximately

25%

of our international sales from our Diagnostics segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:

If the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.

Our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities.

Our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets, particularly as the United States and other countries balance concerns around debt, inflation, growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the United States and internationally. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.



While we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities, a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties, cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.

Certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments, or other measures, and some of these risks are insurable, but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful. Our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.

We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:

•

accurately anticipate customer needs,

•

innovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications,

•

successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,

•

price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and

•

differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.

We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures,  license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable.

We have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisition of Bioo Scientific in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, such as:

•

competition among buyers and licensees,

•

the high valuations of businesses and technologies,

•

the need for regulatory and other approval, and

•

our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.

Some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition. If, for example, we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant in-process research and development that we have capitalized, we may have to impair the value of such assets. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences, loss of key personnel, unforeseen



regulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. Additionally, if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest, the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures. As a result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which may adversely impact our profitability.

We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. The expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.

Third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries.

If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.

Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.

Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. As a result, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

demand for and market acceptance of our products,



•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,

•

changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,

•

changes in general economic conditions or government funding,

•

settlements of income tax audits,

•

expenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation,

•

changes in our effective tax rate,

•

changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,

•

changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers,

•

our ability to introduce new products,

•

our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,

•

costs of raw materials, energy or supplies,

•

changes in healthcare or other reimbursement rates paid by government agencies and other third parties for certain of our products and services,

•

our ability to realize the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives,

•

changes in the volume or timing of product orders,

•

fluctuation in the expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans,

•

changes in our assumptions underlying future funding of pension obligations,

•

changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions, and

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

A significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.

We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States; TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe; and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers.

Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and their derivatives), which may be contained in our products are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. As a result of these rules, we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the



components used in our products be certified as conflict-free, and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs.

The manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products, services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies in the United States and abroad, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil, criminal or monetary penalties.

Our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

We are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards. A failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil, criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.

Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total revenue in

fiscal year 2016

. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes in actual, or from projected, foreign currency exchange rates,



•

changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,

•

embargoes, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,

•

policies in foreign countries benefiting domestic manufacturers or other policies detrimental to companies headquartered in the United States,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,

•

adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives,

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations,

•

difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States,

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws,

•

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection,

•

increasing global enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and

•

differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers and scientists, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees.

Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or inadvertent transfer of information, or if we fail to implement new systems, software and technologies successfully, our business could be adversely affected.

We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop, manufacture and provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems or inadvertent transfer of information could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.

We have a substantial amount of outstanding debt, which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business.

We have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

•

requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and stock repurchases;

•

reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and

•

exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.



In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.

Restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities.

Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, senior unsecured notes due in 2021 ("2021 Notes") and senior unsecured notes due in 2026 ("2026 Notes") include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,

•

sell assets,

•

incur obligations that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to make dividend or other payments to us,

•

guarantee or secure indebtedness,

•

enter into transactions with affiliates, and

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating, our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments.

Any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the 2021 Notes, the 2026 Notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances.

The approval of the Brexit Referendum in the U.K. may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

In a referendum vote held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Nearly 3% of our net sales from continuing operations in 2016 came from the U.K. At this time, we are not able to predict the impact that this vote will have on the economy in Europe, including in the U.K., or on the Great Britain Pound (the “GBP”) or other European exchange rates. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business, and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our sales. In addition, any significant weakening of the GBP to the U.S. dollar will have an adverse impact on our European revenues due to the importance of U.K. sales.

Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.

As of

January 1, 2017

, our total assets included

$2.7 billion

of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, customer relationships, core technology and technology licenses and in-process research and development, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “non-amortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets.

Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.



Our share price will fluctuate.

Over the last several years, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:

•

operating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors,

•

the financial performance of the major end markets that we target,

•

the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us,

•

announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, and

•

changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.

Dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.

On

October 26, 2016

, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of

$0.07

per share for the

fourth

quarter of

fiscal year 2016

that was paid in

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at

January 1, 2017

should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

, provision for income tax on continuing operations was

$28.4 million

and

$20.0 million

January 1, 2017

("fiscal year 2016") and

December 28, 2014

("fiscal year 2014") included


weeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 ("fiscal year 2015") included 53 weeks. The additional week in fiscal year 2015 has been reflected in our third quarter. The fiscal year ending

December 31, 2017

will include


weeks.

Overview of Fiscal Year


We realigned our businesses at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to better organize around customer requirements, positioning us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings. We created two new reporting segments, Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics, which will enable us to deliver improved customer focus, more value-add collaboration and breakthrough innovations. Microfluidics and automation products within our former research business were moved to a new applied genomics group within the Diagnostics segment. In addition, we also moved our Medical Imaging business into discontinued operations due to its pending sale. The results reported for

fiscal year 2016

reflect our new segment structure and the exclusion of our Medical Imaging business from continuing operations. Financial information in this report relating to

fiscal years 2015 and 2014

has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes.

During

fiscal year 2016

, we continued to see good performance from acquisitions, investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives. Our overall revenue in

fiscal year 2016

increase

d

$10.7 million

, or

1%

, as compared to

fiscal year 2015

, reflecting an

increase

of

$26.1 million

, or

5%

, in our Diagnostics segment revenue, which was partially offset by a

decrease

of

$15.4 million

, or

1%

, in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue. The

decrease

in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment was primarily driven by decreases in revenue in our academic and government product offerings within our life sciences research market and a decrease in our environmental and food businesses due to weak harvest conditions, which were partially offset by increased demand in our laboratory services business. The

increase

in our Diagnostics segment revenue during

fiscal year 2016

was primarily due to strong performance of our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as China, as well as in Europe.

In our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, we experienced flat growth during

fiscal year 2016

in several of our products within our life science research end market, as compared to

fiscal year 2015

. During fiscal year 2016, we experienced increased demand for our OneSource laboratory service and informatics businesses. Our OneSource laboratory service business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for them. This was offset by decreases in revenue in our environmental and food business due to weak harvest conditions as well as in our academic and government product offerings due to reduced government funding. We anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient, analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions.

In our Diagnostics segment, we experienced growth from continued expansion in our newborn screening, blood banking and screening businesses. Birth rates in the United States continue to stabilize and demand for greater access to newborn screening in rural areas outside the United States is also increasing, as evidenced by prenatal trends we saw during

fiscal year 2016

. The growth in our Diagnostics segment was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency as the U.S. dollar strengthened. As the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers, we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease, which can result in a reduction of long-term health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients, are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets.



Our consolidated gross margins

increase

d


basis points in

fiscal year 2016

, as compared to

fiscal year 2015

, primarily due to favorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales of higher gross margin product offerings, and benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain. Our consolidated operating margin

increase

d


basis points in

fiscal year 2016

, as compared to

fiscal year 2015

primarily due to higher gross margins and lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives, which were partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development.

We continue to believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services. Overall, we believe that our strategic focus on diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions markets, coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth.

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Revenue


Compared to


.

Revenue for

fiscal year 2016

was

$2,115.5 million

, as compared to

$2,104.8 million

for

fiscal year 2015

, an

increase

of

$10.7 million

, or

1%

, which includes an approximate

1%

decrease

in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates with minimal impact from acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, our fiscal year 2015 had an additional week, which consisted of 53 weeks, as compared to fiscal year 2016, which consisted of 52 weeks. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for

fiscal year 2016

as compared to

fiscal year 2015

and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. The total

increase

in revenue reflects an

increase

in our Diagnostics segment revenue of

$26.1 million

, or

5%

, due to continued expansion in our newborn screening, blood banking and screening businesses. Our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue

decrease

d by

$15.4 million

, or

1%

, due to a

decrease

in environmental, food and industrial markets revenue of

$20.8 million

and life sciences research market revenue of

$0.6 million

, which was partially offset by an

increase

in laboratory services market revenue of

$6.0 million

. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize

$0.7 million

of revenue primarily related to our Diagnostics segment for

fiscal year 2016

and

$0.8 million

for

fiscal year 2015

that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.

$34.9 million

, or

2%

, which includes an approximate

3%

increase

in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures and an approximate

6%

decrease

in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for

fiscal year 2015

as compared to

fiscal year 2014

and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. The total

increase

in revenue reflects a

$44.3 million

, or

3%

,

increase

in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue, due to an

increase

in environmental, food and industrial markets revenue of

$44.9 million

and life sciences research market revenue of

$11.6 million

partially offset by a

decrease

in laboratory services market revenue of

$12.2 million

. Our Diagnostics segment revenue

decrease

d by

$9.3 million

, or

2%

. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize

$0.8 million

of revenue primarily related to our informatics business in our Diagnostics segment for

fiscal year 2015

and

$2.9 million

for

fiscal year 2014

that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.

In addition to the above items, the increase in research and development expenses was primarily the result of investments in new product development, primarily the results of our investments in Vanadis focused on non-invasive prenatal screening and ionics mass spectrometry focused on food and environmental safety applications. This was partially offset by lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives. We directed research and development efforts similarly during

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

, primarily towards the diagnostics, environmental, food, life sciences research and laboratory services markets in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs.

Restructuring and Contract Termination Charges, Net

We have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy, the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives. Restructuring and contract termination charges for

fiscal year 2016

were

$5.1 million

, as compared to

$13.5 million

for

fiscal year 2015

and

$13.3 million

for

fiscal year 2014

.

We implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth product lines (the "Q3 2016 Plan"). We implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets (the "Q2 2016 Plan"). We implemented restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, and the second and first quarters of fiscal year 2014 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets (the "Q4 2015 Plan", "Q2 2014 Plan", and "Q1 2014 Plan", respectively). We implemented restructuring plans in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives (the "Q2 2015 Plan" and "Q3 2014 Plan", respectively). All other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate our businesses in order to realign operations, reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy (the "Previous Plans").

The following table summarizes the number of employees reduced, the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment, and the dates by which payments were substantially completed, or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed, for restructuring actions implemented during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

in continuing operations:

We expect to make payments under the Previous Plans for remaining residual lease obligations, with terms varying in length, through fiscal year


.

We also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. We recorded additional pre-tax charges of

$0.1 million

,

$0.1 million

and

$1.5 million

in the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

, respectively, as a result of these contract terminations.



At

January 1, 2017

, we had

$10.5 million

recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges, of which

$7.5 million

was recorded in short-term accrued restructuring and

$3.1 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities. At

January 3, 2016

, we had

$22.2 million

recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges, of which

$17.0 million

was recorded in short-term accrued restructuring and

$5.1 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan, as well as contract termination accrual balances and related activity, during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

in continuing operations:

____________________________

(1)

During

fiscal year 2016

, we recognized pre-tax restructuring reversals of

$1.0 million

in the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions for the Q4 2015 Plan.

During

fiscal year 2016

, we recognized pre-tax restructuring reversals of

, a

decrease

of

$3.1 million

. The

decrease

in interest and other



expense, net, in

fiscal year 2016

as compared to

fiscal year 2015

was primarily due to a gain on disposition of businesses and assets, net recognized in fiscal year 2016 which was partially offset by an

increase

in interest expense of

$3.5 million

for

fiscal year 2016

as compared to

fiscal year 2015

due to the issuance of the new higher interest rate 2026 Notes, which replaced our lower cost debt outstanding on our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Other expenses for

fiscal year 2016

decrease

d by

$1.1 million

as compared to

fiscal year 2015

, primarily due to expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

The effective tax rates on continuing operations were

11.6%

,

9.6%

and

(5.1)%

for

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

, respectively. Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates. A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

The variation in our effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, predominantly Singapore, Finland, and China, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, resulting in a benefit from income taxes of

$45.8 million

in

fiscal year 2016

,

$34.2 million

in

fiscal year 2015

and

$29.1 million

in

fiscal year 2014

. These amounts include

$11.4 million

in

fiscal year 2016

,

$8.3 million

in

fiscal year 2015

and

$7.1 million

in

fiscal year 2014

of benefits derived from tax holidays in China and Singapore. The effect of these benefits derived from tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for

fiscal year 2016

was

$0.10

and the tax holiday in Singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year


.

Discontinued Operations

As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses.  When the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements, we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. Any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-08,

Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of An Entity

("ASU 2014-08")

,

continues to be reported as a discontinued operation, and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

.



In May 2014, our management approved the shutdown of our microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States, which had been reported within our Diagnostics segment. We determined that, with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers, the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market. The shutdown of the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States resulted in a

$0.1 million

net pre-tax

gain

primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets, which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014.

In August 1999, we sold the assets of our Technical Service business. We recorded pre-tax losses of

$1.8 million

in

fiscal year 2016

,

$0.03 million

in

fiscal year 2015

and

$0.2 million

in

fiscal year 2014

for a contingency related to this business. These losses were recognized as a loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes.

During

fiscal year 2016

, we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pre-tax

loss

of

$1.1 million

. This loss was recognized as a loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes.

During

fiscal year 2016

, we sold PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. for cash consideration of

$20.0 million

, recognizing a pre-tax gain of

$7.1 million

. The sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of

$7.3 million

, which resulted in an income tax benefit of

$2.5 million

that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016. PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. was a component of our Diagnostics segment. The pre-tax gain recognized in

fiscal year 2016

is included in interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The divestiture of PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this Form 10-K because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements.

During

fiscal year 2016

, we entered into a letter of intent to contribute certain assets to an academic institution in the United Kingdom. We recognized a pre-tax loss of

$1.6 million

related to the write-off of assets in the second quarter of 2016 which is included in interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

In December 2016, we entered into a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (the “Purchaser”), under which we agreed to sell to the Purchaser all of the outstanding equity interests in our wholly owned indirect subsidiaries PerkinElmer Medical Holdings, Inc. and Dexela Limited, together with certain assets relating to the business of designing, manufacturing and marketing flat panel x-ray detectors, and related software, accessories and ancillary products, to x-ray system manufacturers (the “Medical Imaging Business”), for cash consideration of approximately

$276.0 million

and the Purchaser’s assumption of specified liabilities relating to the Medical Imaging Business (collectively, the “Transaction”). The Medical Imaging Business has been reported in the Diagnostics segment. The Agreement contemplates that the Purchaser will finance the Transaction through a debt financing and that, except as determined otherwise by the Purchaser, the closing will occur no earlier than April 2017. However, the closing of the Transaction is not conditioned upon the receipt of any such financing. The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of specified antitrust waiting periods. The Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that under specified circumstances, upon termination of the Agreement, the Purchaser will be required to pay us a termination fee of up to

$22.1 million

. The sale of the Medical Imaging Business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements. Accordingly, we classified the assets and liabilities related to the Medical Imaging Business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets and its results of operations are classified as income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.

The summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations, which include the periods prior to disposition and a

$1.0 million

pre-tax restructuring charge related to workforce reductions in the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States during fiscal year 2014, were as follows during the three fiscal years ended:



We recorded a tax

provision

of

$4.3 million

,

$11.5 million

and

$12.9 million

on discontinued operations and dispositions in

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

.

Business Combinations

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2016

During the

fiscal year 2016

, we completed the acquisition of two businesses for a total consideration of

$72.2 million

in cash.  The acquired businesses were Bioo Scientific Corporation, which was acquired for total consideration of

$63.5 million

in cash and one other business acquired for a total consideration of

$8.8 million

in cash. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. As a result of the acquisitions, we recorded goodwill of

$45.6 million

, which is not tax deductible, and intangible assets of

$19.9 million

. We reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions segments from the acquisition dates. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of

9.5

years.

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2015

During fiscal year 2015, we completed the acquisition of five businesses for a total consideration of

$77.1 million

in cash. The acquired businesses included Vanadis Diagnostics AB ("Vanadis"), which was acquired for total consideration of

$35.1 million

in cash, as further described in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, and other acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of

$42.0 million

in cash. We have a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of Vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to

$93.0 million

, which at closing had an estimated fair value of

$56.9 million

. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, of which

$9.2 million

is tax deductible. We reported the operations for all of these acquisitions within the results of our Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions segments from the acquisition dates.

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2014

Acquisition of Perten Instruments Group AB.

In December 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Perten Instruments Group AB ("Perten"). Perten is a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food, grain, flour and feed. We expect this acquisition to enhance our industrial, environmental and safety business by expanding our product offerings to the academic and industrial end markets. We paid the shareholders of Perten

$269.9 million

in cash for the stock of Perten. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment from the acquisition date.

Other acquisitions in fiscal year 2014.

In addition to the Perten acquisition, we completed the acquisition of two businesses in fiscal year 2014 for total consideration of

$17.6 million

in cash and

$4.3 million

of assumed debt. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill,

none

of which is tax deductible. We reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions segments from the acquisition dates.

We do not consider the acquisitions completed during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

, to be material to our consolidated results of operations; therefore, we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. During

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

, we recognized

$80.7 million

and

$65.7 million

, respectively, of revenue for Perten. We have determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of the other acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition.

As of

January 1, 2017

, the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in

fiscal years 2015 and 2014

were final. The preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in

were based upon initial valuations. Our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods. During the measurement periods, we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates



that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates. With our adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16,

Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

("ASU No. 2015-16") during 2015, these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates. All changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings.

During

fiscal year 2016

, we obtained information to assist in determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of our acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations. Based on this information, for acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2015, we recognized an increase in deferred taxes of

$1.8 million

, with a corresponding increase in goodwill.

Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period.

As of

January 1, 2017

, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to

$84.6 million

. As of

January 1, 2017

, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of

$63.2 million

, of which

$15.4 million

was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and

$47.8 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities. As of

January 3, 2016

, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of

$57.4 million

, of which

$9.4 million

was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and

$48.0 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed


years from the respective acquisition dates, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at

January 1, 2017

was

1.75

years. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations.

In connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. We do not include any costs associated with selling effort, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.

Contingencies, Including Tax Matters

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued

$9.9 million

and

$11.8 million

as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. During fiscal year 2014, we recorded a benefit of

$2.3 million

for cost reimbursements related to a particular site, of which

$1.2 million

was for future monitoring and mitigation activities. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation



may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Various tax years after


remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, such as Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. We make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in our opinion, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at

January 1, 2017

should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we realigned our businesses to better position us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings. Diagnostics became a standalone operating segment and we formed a new operating segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions. In addition, we moved our Medical Imaging Business into discontinued operations due to its pending sale. The results reported for

fiscal year 2016

reflect our new segment structure and the exclusion of our Medical Imaging Business from continuing operations. Financial information in this report relating to

fiscal years 2015 and 2014

has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes.

and a

decrease

in life sciences market revenue of

$0.6 million

, which was partially offset by an

increase

in laboratory services market revenue of

. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize

$27 thousand

of revenue in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment for

fiscal year 2015

that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. In our environmental, food and industrial markets, revenue decreased due to weak harvest conditions. In our life sciences research market, we experienced decreases in revenue from our academic and government product offerings due to reduced government funding. In our laboratory services market, we had increased demand for our OneSource service offerings. Our OneSource laboratory service business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for our customers.

from the laboratory services market. The increase in revenue was primarily due to revenue from our acquisition of Perten in December 2014, as well as growth in our materials characterization product family within our environmental and industrial markets. In our life sciences research market, we experienced increased demand for our informatics business, as well as an increase in revenue from new product introductions, such as the Opera Phenix. In our laboratory services market, we had increased demand for our OneSource service offerings. The growth in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment was more than offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency as the U.S. dollar strengthened, particularly versus the Euro.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and

•

changes in our working capital requirements.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•

increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•

a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,

•

increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,

•

a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•

volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

, which were partially offset by

an increase

in accounts receivable of

$19.0 million

. The

decrease

in inventory was primarily a result of higher sales volume late in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, partially offset by the result of realigning operations, research and development resources, and production resources within our Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments to ensure responsiveness to customer requirements as this realignment occurs. The

increase

$27.2 million

in

fiscal year 2014

. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the settlement of life insurance policies of

$0.8 million

in

fiscal year 2015

, as compared to

$0.5 million

in

fiscal year 2014

.

Financing Activities.

Net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations was

$107.1 million

for

fiscal year 2015

, as compared to net cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations of

$30.9 million

for

fiscal year 2014

, a change of

$138.1 million

. For

fiscal year 2015

, we repurchased

1.5 million

shares of our common stock, including

95,129

shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans, for a total cost of

$76.4 million

, including commissions. This compares to repurchases of

1.4 million

shares of our common stock, including

98,269

shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans, for a total cost of

$65.5 million

, including commissions, for

fiscal year 2014

. This use of cash in

fiscal year 2015

was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of

$14.9 million

. This compares to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of

$24.5 million

in

fiscal year 2014

. During

fiscal year 2015

, borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled

$451.0 million

, which was more than offset by debt payments of

$485.0 million

. This compares to borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of

$475.0 million

, which was partially offset by debt payments of

$356.0 million

in

fiscal year 2014

. We paid

$31.6 million

in dividends during both

fiscal years 2015 and 2014

. During

fiscal year 2015

, we made net payments of

$1.1 million

on other credit facilities primarily for lease payments for our financing lease obligations, as described below under financing lease obligations, as compared to

$12.7 million

during

fiscal year 2014

. During

fiscal year 2015

, we also received

$18.7 million

for the settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts related to intercompany loans utilized to finance our acquisitions. We also made

$0.1 million

in payments for acquisition-related contingent consideration during

fiscal year 2015

, as compared to

$0.9 million

during

fiscal year 2014

.

Borrowing Arrangements

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

On August 11, 2016, we terminated our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five year term and an expansion of borrowing capacity from

$700.0 million

to

$1.0 billion

. The new senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for

$1.0 billion

of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of

August 11, 2021

. As of

January 1, 2017

, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of

$11.4 million

were treated as issued and outstanding when calculating the borrowing availability under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of

January 1, 2017

, we had

$988.6 million

available for additional borrowing under the facility. We use the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate or the base rate at the time of borrowing, plus a margin. The base rate is the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) an adjusted one-month Libor plus 1.00%. As of

January 1, 2017

, the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility had no outstanding borrowings, and

$4.3 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of

January 3, 2016

, the previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an aggregate carrying value of

$479.6 million

, which was net of

$2.4 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs. The credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. The financial covenants include a debt-to-capital ratio that remains applicable for so long as our debt is rated as investment grade. In the event that our debt is not rated as investment grade, the debt-to-capital ratio covenant is replaced with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of

January 1, 2017

.

5%

Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2021.

On October 25, 2011, we issued

$500.0 million

aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) in a registered public offering and received

$496.9 million

of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2021 Notes were issued at

99.372%

of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of

$3.1 million

. As of

January 1, 2017

, the 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of

$495.8 million

, net of

$1.7 million

of unamortized original issue discount and

$2.5 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of

January 3, 2016

, the 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of

$495.1 million

, net of

$2.0 million

of unamortized original issue discount and

$2.9 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs. The 2021 Notes mature in November 2021 and bear interest at an annual rate of

5%

. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th each year. Prior to August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 Notes being redeemed, discounted on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and



unpaid interest. At any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 Notes below investment grade, each holder of 2021 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holder's 2021 Notes for

101%

of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

1.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026.

On July 19, 2016, we issued

€500.0 million

aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) in a registered public offering and received approximately

€492.3 million

of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2026 Notes were issued at

99.118%

of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of

€4.4 million

. The 2026 Notes mature in

July 2026

and bear interest at an annual rate of

1.875%

. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable annually on July 19th each year.  The proceeds from the 2026 Notes were used to pay in full the outstanding balance of our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  As of

January 1, 2017

, the 2026 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of

$517.8 million

, net of

$4.5 million

of unamortized original issue discount and

$4.8 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs.

Prior to April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2026 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2026 Notes being redeemed, discounted on an annual basis, at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) plus 35 basis points; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time on or after April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2026 Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes due to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2026 Notes below investment grade, we will, in certain circumstances, make an offer to purchase the 2026 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Financing Lease Obligations.

In fiscal year 2012, we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. We provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, and as a result we were considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. We are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for us and non-cash investing and financing activities. As a result, we capitalized

$29.3 million

in property, plant and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. We have also capitalized

$11.5 million

in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings, which were funded by the lessors, with a corresponding increase to debt. At

January 1, 2017

, we had

$37.1 million

recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which

$1.2 million

was recorded as short-term debt and

$35.9 million

was recorded as long-term debt. At

January 3, 2016

, we had

$38.2 million

recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which

$1.1 million

was recorded as short-term debt and

$37.1 million

was recorded as long-term debt. The buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.

Dividends

Our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of

$0.07

per share in each quarter of

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

, resulting in an annual dividend rate of

$0.28

per share. At

January 1, 2017

, we had accrued

$7.7 million

for dividends declared on

October 26, 2016

for the

fourth

quarter of

fiscal year 2016

that was paid in

February 2017

. On

January 27, 2017

, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of

$0.07

per share for the

first

quarter of

fiscal year 2017

that will be payable in

May 2017

. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at

January 1, 2017

for continuing and discontinued operations. Purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table:

____________________________

(1)

The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates. As of

January 1, 2017

, we had no outstanding borrowings in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

(2)

The 2021 Notes include interest obligations. As of

January 1, 2017

,  the 2021 Notes had a carrying value of

$495.8 million

.

(3)

The 2026 Notes include interest obligations. As of

January 1, 2017

, the 2026 Notes had a carrying value of

$517.8 million

.

(4)

The financing lease obligations do not include interest obligations.

(5)

Employee benefit payments only include obligations through fiscal year 2026.

(6)

We have excluded

$1.3 million

, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, from our uncertain tax positions, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

As of

January 1, 2017

, we may have to pay the shareholders of our acquisitions contingent consideration of up to

$84.6 million

. The table above does not reflect any of these obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain. For further information related to our contingent consideration obligations, see Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Capital Expenditures

During

fiscal year 2017

, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in

fiscal year 2016

, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.

Other Potential Liquidity Considerations

At

January 1, 2017

, we had cash and cash equivalents of

$359.3 million

, of which

$348.5 million

was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we had

$988.6 million

of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We had no other liquid investments at

January 1, 2017

.

We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Of the

$348.5 million

of cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries at

January 1, 2017

, we would incur U.S. taxes on approximately

$322.5 million

if transferred to the U.S. without proper planning. We expect the accumulated non-U.S. cash balances, which may not be transferred to the U.S. without incurring U.S. taxes, will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.

On October 23, 2014, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to

8.0 million

shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). On July 27, 2016, the Board authorized us to immediately terminate the Repurchase Program and further authorized us to repurchase up to

8.0 million

shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "New Repurchase Program"). The New Repurchase Program will expire on July 26, 2018 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the

fiscal year 2016

, we



repurchased

3.2 million

shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of

$148.2 million

, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. No shares remain available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program due to its cancellation. As of

January 1, 2017

,

8.0 million

shares remained available for repurchase under the New Repurchase Program.

In addition, our Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans. During

fiscal year 2016

, we repurchased

75,198

shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of

$3.6 million

.

The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the New Repurchase Program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

Distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.

Our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. With respect to plans outside of the United States, we expect to contribute

$7.6 million

in the aggregate during fiscal year 2017. During

fiscal year 2016

, we contributed

$9.6 million

, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States. We could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. During fiscal year 2015, we made contributions of

$14.9 million

, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the United States and

$20.0 million

to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States. During fiscal year 2014, we contributed

$11.2 million

, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the United States. We expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.

Effects of Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("the FASB") and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations.

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

("ASU 2017-04")

,

which amends Topic 350 to simplify the subsequent measurement of  goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. ASU 2017-04 requires that an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize the impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider the income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We intend to early adopt ASU 2017-04 and will apply the provisions of this standard in our interim or annual goodwill impairment tests subsequent to January 1, 2017.

In January 2017, the FASB  issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01,

Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business

("ASU 2017-01"),  which amends Topic 805 to provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. If the screen is not met, the standard (1) requires that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly



contribute to the ability to create output and (2) removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. The standard provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. The standard also provides a framework that includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs and a more stringent criteria for sets without outputs. Lastly, the standard narrows the definition of the term "output" so that the term is consistent with how outputs are described in Topic 606. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted in limited circumstances. We are still evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash

("ASU 2016-18"), which amends Topic 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16,

Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory

("ASU 2016-16"). ASU 2016-16 removes the prohibition in ASC 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The standard requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230 and other topics. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented, and if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, ASU 2016-15 allows the amendments for those issues to be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard requires entities to use the expected loss impairment model and will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Entities are required to estimate the lifetime “expected credit loss” for each applicable financial asset and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an AFS debt security is a credit loss. An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on an AFS debt security as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,

Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

("ASU No. 2016-09"). The new standard simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the related classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires an entity to recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, and such tax benefits and tax deficiencies are not included in the estimate of an entity’s annual effective tax rate, applied on a prospective basis. Further, the standard eliminates the requirement to defer the recognition of excess tax benefits until the benefit is realized through a reduction to taxes payable. All excess tax benefits previously unrecognized, along with any valuation allowance, should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. Under ASU No. 2016-09, an entity that applies the treasury stock method in calculating diluted earnings per share is required to exclude excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the calculation of assumed proceeds since such amounts are recognized in the income statement. Excess tax benefits should also be classified as operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes on the statement of cash flows, as such excess tax benefits no longer represent financing activities since they are recognized in the income statement, and should be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted ASU No. 2016-09 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. We recorded a cumulative increase of

$14.2 million

in the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 retained earnings with a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets related to the prior years' unrecognized excess tax benefits. Excess tax benefits related to exercised options and vested restricted stock and restricted stock units during the

fiscal year 2016

have been recognized in the current period’s income statement. We also excluded the excess tax benefits from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for

fiscal year 2016

. We applied the cash flow presentation section of the guidance on a prospective basis, and the prior period statement of cash flows was not adjusted. ASU No. 2016-09 also allows an entity to elect as an accounting policy either to continue to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered or to account for forfeitures for service based awards as they occur. An entity that elects to account for forfeitures as they occur should apply the accounting change on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. We elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of this accounting policy did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,

Leases

("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. ASU 2016-02 also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-02 is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory

. Under this new guidance, companies that use inventory measurement methods other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASU 2014-09"). Under this new guidance, an entity should use a five-step process to recognize revenue, depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Subsequent to the issuance of the standard, the FASB decided to defer the effective date for one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In May 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients

("ASU 2016-12")

,

which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on transition, collectibility, non-cash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers. In April 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and



Licensing

("ASU 2016-10")

,

which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations to allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of the contract, clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable (i.e., distinct within the context of the contract) and allow an entity to elect to account for the cost of shipping and handling performed after control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost (i.e., an expense). ASU 2016-10 also clarifies how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property ("IP") and requires entities to classify IP in one of two categories: functional IP or symbolic IP, which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time. ASU 2016-10 also address how entities should consider license renewals and restrictions and apply the exception for sales- and usage-based royalties received in exchange for licenses of IP. In March 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

("ASU 2016-08"), which amended the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate when it is the principal or agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2014-09 may be adopted either using a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the requirements of the foregoing standards and have not yet determined the impact of their adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We intend to adopt these standards using the modified retrospective approach, and we do not intend to early adopt these standards. While we are currently evaluating the impact of the new revenue standard, we believe the key changes in the standard that impact revenue recognition relate to the accounting for certain transactions with multiple elements or “bundled” arrangements (for example, sales of software subscriptions for which we do not have VSOE for maintenance and/or support) because the requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements under current accounting standards is eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over the maintenance period.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, bad debts, inventories, accounting for business combinations and dispositions, long-lived assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. For revenue that includes customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of our products require specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as services are rendered.

In limited circumstances, we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time, such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component, including cord blood processing and storage. For these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if such evidence is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, and management's best estimate of selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. TPE is the price of our or any competitor's largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly-situated customers. BESP is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors.



Revenue from software licenses and services was

5%

of our total revenue for each of

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

. We sell our software licenses with maintenance services and, in some cases, also with consulting services. For the undelivered elements, we determine VSOE of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine VSOE for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the stated renewal rate method. We determine VSOE for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements on a stand-alone basis.

We recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and/or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method, provided that the above criteria have been met. If VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established, we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered, or if the only undelivered element is maintenance, then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period.

The majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.

Warranty costs

. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period.

Allowances for doubtful accounts.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (i) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (ii) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings. Accounts are written-off only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted.

Inventory valuation.

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.

Business combinations.

Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.

Value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.

We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest



that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. We perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. We completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of

January 4, 2016

and

January 1, 2015

, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. At

January 4, 2016

, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than

20.0%

for each reporting unit. At the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we realigned our organization into two new operating segments. In conjunction with the realignment of our operating segments, we also redefined our reporting units based on our operating segments. We determined that the reporting units that should be used to test goodwill for impairment are environmental health excluding food, food, life sciences and technology, informatics, OneSource, diagnostics excluding cord blood, cord blood and medical imaging. As a result of the realignment, we reallocated goodwill from our life sciences and technology reporting unit to our diagnostics excluding cord blood reporting unit based on the relative fair value, determined using the income approach, of the applied genomics business which resulted in

$125.8 million

of goodwill being reallocated from our life sciences and technology reporting unit to our diagnostics excluding food reporting unit as of October 3, 2016. As of January 2, 2017, our Informatics reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of

$211.0 million

, had a fair value that was less than 20% but greater than 10% more than its carrying value. Informatics is at increased risk of an impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due to a highly competitive industry. Despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit, we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of this reporting unit that would lead to a material impairment charge. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.

Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible asset at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of our non-amortizing intangible asset is no longer indefinite, the asset will be tested for impairment. This intangible asset will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization.

Employee compensation and benefits.

We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.

We recognized

a loss

of

$14.5 million

in

fiscal year 2016

,

a loss

of

$9.4 million

in

fiscal year 2015

and

a loss

of

$77.2 million

in

fiscal year 2014

for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which includes the charge for the mark-to-market adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The loss or income related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pre-tax

loss

of

$15.3 million

in

fiscal year 2016

, a pre-tax

loss

of

$12.4 million

in

fiscal year 2015

and pre-tax

loss

of

$75.4 million

in

fiscal year 2014

. We expect income of approximately

$4.5 million

in

fiscal year 2017

for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment. It is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in

fiscal year 2017

. Mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. To the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in

fiscal year 2017

. Conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in

fiscal year 2017

. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year. Beginning in



fiscal year 2016, the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain non-US benefit plans was changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. Prior to fiscal year 2016, we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period.

As of

January 1, 2017

, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States to be

7.25%

and to be

6.00%

for all plans outside the United States. In addition, as of

January 1, 2017

, we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States to be

4.05%

and to be

2.06%

for all plans outside the United States. For the plans in the United States, we adopted the updated projection scale, MP-2015, that was published by the Society of Actuaries in 2015, as of January 3, 2016. The adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a

$6.8 million

decrease to the projected benefit obligation as of January 3, 2016. During fiscal year 2016, the Society of Actuaries issued an updated projection scale, MP-2016, which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation. We adopted MP-2016, as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a

$5.5 million

decrease to the projected benefit obligation at January 1, 2017. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date.

If any of our assumptions were to change as of

January 1, 2017

, our pension plan expenses would also change.

We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.

Restructuring activities.

Our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (i) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements, (ii) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (iii) impairment of assets as discussed above under “Value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges, net.”



Dispositions.

When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the fiscal year ended

January 1, 2017

, pre-tax

gain

s from the disposition of discontinued operations was not material. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings.

Income taxes.

Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine our current tax provision as well as enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled to determine our deferred tax provision. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.

Additionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including state net operating loss carryforwards, state income tax credit carryforwards, and certain foreign tax attributes. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision.

Taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely reinvested because we plan to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost. Our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. As of

January 1, 2017

, the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the U.S. indefinitely and for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was approximately

$1.1 billion

. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, derivatives, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of

January 1, 2017

.

We use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only, and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use



leveraged financial instruments. Approximately

60%

of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed


months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen and Singapore Dollar. We held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling

$137.5 million

at

January 1, 2017

,

$127.3 million

at

January 3, 2016

and

$95.0 million

at

December 28, 2014

, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally


days or less during each of

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

.

In addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions and stock repurchase program, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. We record these hedges at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

As of

January 1, 2017

, the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, that were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined Euro notional amounts of

€58.6 million

, combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of

$8.7 million

and combined Swedish Krona notional amounts of

kr969.5 million

. The combined Euro notional amounts of these outstanding hedges was

€107.4 million

and

€238.2 million

as of

January 3, 2016

and

December 28, 2014

, respectively. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for the fiscal years ended

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

. We paid

$1.9 million

and received

$18.7 million

during the fiscal years ended

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively, from the settlement of these hedges.

During

fiscal year 2016

, we entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of €492.3 million to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges were included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), which offsets the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. The foreign currency forward contracts were settled during

fiscal year 2016

and we recorded a net realized foreign exchange gain in AOCI amounting to $1.8 million during the

fiscal year 2016

.

During fiscal year 2016, in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, we designated the 2026 Notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges will be included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, which will offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of

January 1, 2017

, the total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was

€495.8 million

. The unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in AOCI related to the net investment hedge was

$23.8 million

during the

fiscal year 2016

.

Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.



Foreign Exchange Risk.

The potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately

60%

of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the United States, resulting in natural hedges.

Although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted.

Foreign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk Disclosure

. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a

95%

confidence interval and a holding period of


days. As of

January 1, 2017

, this computation estimated that there is a

5%

chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than

$0.3 million

. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in

fiscal year 2016

, the Value-At-Risk ranged between

$0.1 million

and

$0.6 million

, with an average of approximately

$0.3 million

.

Interest Rate Risk.

As of

January 1, 2017

, we had no outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility; however, as described above in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources,” amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility would bear interest at variable rates. Our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were

$359.3 million

at

January 1, 2017

. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures.

Interest Rate Risk—Sensitivity

. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:

(i) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate. An increase of

10%

, or approximately


basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by

$0.1 million

for

fiscal year 2017

.

(ii) Changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate.

Financial Statements and Supplemental Data




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

January 1, 2017

. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

January 1, 2017

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

January 1, 2017

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a leading provider of products, services and solutions to the diagnostics, research, environmental, industrial, food and laboratory services markets. Through its advanced technologies and differentiated solutions, critical issues are addressed that help to improve lives and the world around us. The results are reported within two reporting segments: Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company realigned its businesses at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to better organize around customer requirements, position the Company to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with the Company's core product offerings. The Company created two new operating segments, Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics, which will enable the Company to deliver improved customer focus, more value-add collaboration and breakthrough innovations. The Company's Diagnostics business became a standalone operating segment targeted towards better meeting the needs of clinically-oriented customers, especially within the growing areas of reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and applied genomics. The new Diagnostics operating segment includes the products and services of the Company's diagnostics business, formerly in the Human Health segment, and the Company's microfluidics and automation products, formerly within the research business in the Human Health segment. The Company's new Discovery & Analytical Solutions operating segment combines the Company's former environmental health business, formerly in the Environmental Health segment, and the remaining products and services within the research business, formerly in the Human Health segment. The Discovery & Analytical Solutions operating segment will advance the Company's success in serving and innovating for its applications-oriented customers in the environmental, food, industrial, life sciences and laboratory services markets.

The Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. Each of the fiscal years ended

January 1, 2017

and

December 28, 2014

included


weeks. The fiscal year ended

January 3, 2016

included


weeks. The additional week in fiscal year 2015 has been reflected in the Company's third quarter. The fiscal year ending

December 31, 2017

will include


weeks.

Accounting Policies and Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company’s product revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. For revenue that includes customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of the Company’s products require specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period, or as services are rendered.

In limited circumstances, the Company has arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time, such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component, including cord blood processing and storage. For these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if such evidence is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, and management's best estimate of selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. TPE is the price of the Company's or any competitor's largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly-situated customers. BESP is the price at which the Company would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue from software licenses and services was

5%

of the Company's total revenue for each of

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

. The Company sells its software licenses with maintenance services and, in some cases, also with consulting services. For the undelivered elements, the Company determines VSOE of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately. The Company determines VSOE for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the stated renewal rate method. The Company determines VSOE for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements on a stand-alone basis.

The Company recognizes revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and/or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method, provided that the above criteria have been met. If VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established, the Company defers all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered, or if the only undelivered element is maintenance, then the Company recognizes the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period.

The Company recognizes revenue from the grant of certain intellectual property rights for patented technologies it owns. These rights typically include a combination of the following: the grant of a non-exclusive, retroactive and future license to patented technologies, a covenant-not-to-sue, the release of the licensee from certain claims, and the dismissal of any pending litigation. The intellectual property rights granted may be perpetual in nature, extending until the expiration of the related patents, or can be granted for a defined timeframe. For these arrangements, the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by the selling-price hierarchy. In the case where the agreement includes the dismissal of any pending litigation, the Company allocates between revenue and litigation settlement using the residual method. The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete and upon the execution of the agreement, when collectability is reasonably assured, or upon receipt of the minimum upfront fee for term agreement renewals, and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Service revenues represent the Company’s service offerings including service contracts, field service including related time and materials, diagnostic testing, cord blood processing and storage, and training. Service revenues are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues for service contracts and storage contracts are recognized over the contract period.

The Company sells products and accessories predominantly through its direct sales force. As a result, the use of distributors is generally limited to geographic regions where the Company has no direct sales force. The Company does not offer product return or exchange rights (other than those relating to defective goods under warranty) or price protection allowances to its customers, including its distributors. Payment terms granted to distributors are the same as those granted to end-user customers and payments are not dependent upon the distributors’ receipt of payment from their end-user customers. Sales incentives related to distributor revenue are also the same as those for end-user customers.

Warranty Costs

:    The Company provides for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company reports shipping and handling revenue in revenue, to the extent they are billed to customers, and the associated costs in cost of product revenue.

Inventories

:    Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.

Income Taxes:

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely than not. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax for the repatriation of such foreign earnings.

The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. These reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. See Note 6 below for additional details.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over its estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings-


to


years; leasehold improvements-estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter; and machinery and equipment-


to


years. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a


-year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Asset Retirement Obligations

:    The Company records obligations associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with authoritative guidance on asset retirement obligations. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as interest expense. The amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are not material to any year presented.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits:

The Company sponsors both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. The Company immediately recognizes actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to the Company's fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless the Company is required to perform an interim remeasurement. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis. The Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

For foreign operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as translation gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions considered permanent in nature, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses arising from transactions and translation of period-end balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in other expense, net.

Business Combinations:

Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

The Company’s intangible assets consist of (i) goodwill, which is not being amortized; (ii) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of a trade name that is not subject to amortization; and (iii) amortizing intangibles, which consist of patents, trade names and trademarks, licenses, customer relationships, and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.

The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. This annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year, should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Amortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their respective fair values. See Note 12 below for additional details.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense based on estimated grant date fair value, generally using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, as expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period. The determination of fair value and the timing of expense using option pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company estimates the expected term assumption based on historical experience. In determining the Company’s expected stock price volatility assumption, the Company reviews both the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s common stock, with implied volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock. The Company has

one

stock-based compensation plan from which it makes grants, which is described more fully in Note 18 below.

Marketable Securities and Investments:

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. If securities are classified as available for sale, the Company records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Under the cost method of accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, additional investments or distributions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.

Environmental Matters:

The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.

Research and Development:

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The fair value of acquired IPR&D costs are recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the product is ready for sale or expensed if abandoned.

Restructuring Charges:

In recent fiscal years, the Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of its operations with its growth strategy, the integration of its business units and its productivity initiatives. In connection with these initiatives, the Company has recorded restructuring charges, as more fully described in Note 4 below. Generally, costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred. Prior to recording restructuring charges for employee separation agreements, the Company notifies all employees of termination. Costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period. Costs related to lease terminations are recorded at the fair value of the liability based on the remaining lease rental payments, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, at the date the Company ceases use.

Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Derivative Instruments and Hedging:

Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms of the contract to the underlying transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive income, unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements. Settled cash flow hedges related to forecasted transactions that remain probable are recorded as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and are subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis. The Company also has entered into other foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into interest and other expense, net on the consolidated financial statements.

The Company also uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in the foreign currency translation component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"), as well as the offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to the Company’s operations.

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

("ASU 2017-04")

,

which amends Topic 350 to simplify the subsequent measurement of  goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. ASU 2017-04 requires that an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize the impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider the income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company intends to early adopt ASU 2017-04 and will apply the provisions of this standard in its interim or annual goodwill impairment tests subsequent to January 1, 2017.

In January 2017, the FASB  issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01,

Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business

("ASU 2017-01"),  which amends Topic 805 to provide a screen to determine when a set of assets and liabilities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. If the screen is not met, the standard (1) requires that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and (2) removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. The standard provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. The standard also provides a framework that includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs and a more stringent criteria for sets without outputs. Lastly, the standard narrows the definition of the term "output" so that the term is consistent with how outputs are described in Topic 606. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted in limited circumstances. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash

("ASU 2016-18"), which amends Topic 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16,

Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory

("ASU 2016-16"). ASU 2016-16 removes the prohibition in ASC 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The standard requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230 and other topics. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented, and if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, ASU 2016-15 allows the amendments for those issues to be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard requires entities to use the expected loss impairment model and will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Entities are required to estimate the lifetime “expected credit loss” for each applicable financial asset and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an AFS debt security is a credit loss. An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on an AFS debt security as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,

Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

("ASU No. 2016-09"). The new standard simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the related classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires an entity to recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, and such tax benefits and tax deficiencies are not included in the estimate of an entity’s annual effective tax rate, applied on a prospective basis.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Further, the standard eliminates the requirement to defer the recognition of excess tax benefits until the benefit is realized through a reduction to taxes payable. All excess tax benefits previously unrecognized, along with any valuation allowance, should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. Under ASU No. 2016-09, an entity that applies the treasury stock method in calculating diluted earnings per share is required to exclude excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the calculation of assumed proceeds since such amounts are recognized in the income statement. Excess tax benefits should also be classified as operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes on the statement of cash flows, as such excess tax benefits no longer represent financing activities since they are recognized in the income statement, and should be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The Company recorded a cumulative increase of

$14.2 million

in the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 retained earnings with a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets related to the prior years' unrecognized excess tax benefits. Excess tax benefits related to exercised options and vested restricted stock and restricted stock units during the

fiscal year 2016

have been recognized in the current period’s income statement. The Company also excluded the excess tax benefits from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for

fiscal year 2016

. The Company applied the cash flow presentation section of the guidance on a prospective basis, and the prior period statement of cash flows was not adjusted. ASU No. 2016-09 also allows an entity to elect as an accounting policy either to continue to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered or to account for forfeitures for service based awards as they occur. An entity that elects to account for forfeitures as they occur should apply the accounting change on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of this accounting policy did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,

Leases

("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. ASU 2016-02 also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-02 is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory

. Under this new guidance, companies that use inventory measurement methods other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASU 2014-09"). Under this new guidance, an entity should use a five-step process to recognize revenue, depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Subsequent to the issuance of the standard, the FASB decided to defer the effective date for one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In May 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients

("ASU 2016-12")

,

which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on transition, collectibility, non-cash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers. In April 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing

("ASU 2016-10")

,

which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations to allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of the contract, clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable (i.e., distinct within the context of the contract) and allow an entity to elect to account for the cost of shipping and handling performed after control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost (i.e., an expense). ASU 2016-10 also clarifies how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property ("IP") and requires entities to classify IP in one of two categories: functional IP or symbolic IP, which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time. ASU 2016-10 also address how entities should consider



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

license renewals and restrictions and apply the exception for sales- and usage-based royalties received in exchange for licenses of IP. In March 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

("ASU 2016-08"), which amended the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate when it is the principal or agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2014-09 may be adopted either using a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the requirements of the foregoing standards and has not yet determined the impact of their adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company intends to adopt these standards using the modified retrospective approach, and the Company does not intend to early adopt these standards.

While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new revenue standard, the Company believes the key changes in the standard that impact revenue recognition relate to the accounting for certain transactions with multiple elements or “bundled” arrangements (for example, sales of software subscriptions for which the Company does not have VSOE for maintenance and/or support) because the requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements under current accounting standards is eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, the Company may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over the maintenance period.

Business Combinations

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2016

During

fiscal year 2016

, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses for a total consideration of

$72.2 million

in cash.  The acquired businesses were Bioo Scientific Corporation, which was acquired for total consideration of

$63.5 million

in cash and one other business acquired for a total consideration of

$8.8 million

in cash. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill of

$45.6 million

, which is not tax deductible, and intangible assets of

$19.9 million

. The Company has reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of the Company's Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions segments from the acquisition dates. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of

9.5

years.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The total purchase price for the acquisitions in

fiscal year 2016

has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:

Subsequent to

January 1, 2017

, the Company completed the acquisition of Tulip Diagnostics Private Limited (“Tulip”), a company based in Goa, India, for a total consideration of

$125.0 million

in cash, net of cash acquired, as of the closing date. The Company has a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of Tulip additional contingent consideration of up to

$25.0 million

that will be accounted for as compensation expense in the Company's financial statements over a two year period. The operations for this acquisition will be reported within the results of the Company's Diagnostics segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2015

During fiscal year 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of five businesses for a total consideration of

$77.1 million

in cash. The acquired businesses included Vanadis Diagnostics AB (“Vanadis”), which was acquired for total consideration of

$35.1 million

in cash, as further described in Note 21 below, and other acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of

$42.0 million

in cash. The Company has a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of Vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to

$93.0 million

, which at closing had an estimated fair value of

$56.9 million

. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, of which

$9.2 million

is tax deductible. The Company has reported the operations for all of these acquisitions within the results of the Company’s Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions segments from the acquisition dates. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology and trade names, acquired as part of this acquisition had a weighted average amortization period of

9 years

.

The total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2015 has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2014

Acquisition of Perten Instruments Group AB.

In December 2014, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Perten Instruments Group AB ("Perten"). Perten is a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food, grain, flour and feed. The Company expects this acquisition to enhance its industrial, environmental and safety business by expanding the Company's product offerings to the academic and industrial end markets. The Company paid the shareholders of Perten

$269.9 million

in cash for the stock of Perten. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill,

none

of which is tax deductible. The Company has reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment from the acquisition date. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, customer relationships and trade names, acquired as part of this acquisition had weighted average amortization periods of approximately


to

10 years

.

Other acquisitions in fiscal year 2014.

In addition to the Perten acquisition, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses in fiscal year 2014 for total consideration of

$17.6 million

in cash and

$4.3 million

of assumed debt. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill,

none

of which is tax deductible. The Company reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of the Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments from the acquisition dates.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:

The Company does not consider the acquisitions completed during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

to be material to its consolidated results of operations; therefore, the Company is not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. During

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

, the Company recognized

$80.7 million

and

$65.7 million

, respectively, of revenue for Perten. The Company has determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of the other acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition.

As of

January 1, 2017

, the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years


and


were final. The preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in

fiscal year 2016

were based upon initial valuations. The Company's estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete its valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to

one year

from the respective acquisition dates. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods. During the measurement periods, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates. These adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates. All changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings.

During

fiscal year 2016

, the Company obtained information to assist in determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of its acquisitions and adjusted its purchase price allocations. Based on this information, for acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2015, the Company recognized an increase in deferred taxes of

$1.8 million

, with a corresponding increase in goodwill.

Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period.

As of

January 1, 2017

, the Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to

$84.6 million

. As of

January 1, 2017

, the Company has recorded contingent consideration obligations of

$63.2 million

, of which

$15.4 million

was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and

$47.8 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities. As of

January 3, 2016

, the Company has recorded contingent consideration obligations of

$57.4 million

, of which

$9.4 million

was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and

$48.0 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed


years from the respective acquisition dates, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at

January 1, 2017

was

1.75

years. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations.

In connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions, the Company estimates the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with its acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. The Company does not include any costs associated with selling effort, research and development, or the related margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that the Company would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.

Total transaction costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities for

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

were

$1.2 million

,

$0.7 million

and

$3.1 million

, respectively. These transaction costs were expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Note 3:

Disposition of Businesses and Assets

As part of the Company’s continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses.  When the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements, the Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. Any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08,

Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of An Entity,

continues to be reported as a discontinued operation, and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company recorded the following pre-tax gains and losses, which have been reported as a net gain or loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended:

During

fiscal year 2016

, the Company sold PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. for cash consideration of

$20.0 million

, recognizing a pre-tax gain of

$7.1 million

. The sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of

$7.3 million

, which resulted in an income tax benefit of

$2.5 million

that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016. PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. was a component of the Company's Diagnostics segment. The pre-tax gain recognized in

fiscal year 2016

is included in interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The divestiture of PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this Form 10-K because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements.

During

fiscal year 2016

, the Company entered into a letter of intent to contribute certain assets to an academic institution in the United Kingdom. The Company recognized a pre-tax loss of

$1.6 million

related to the write-off of assets in the second quarter of 2016 which is included in interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

In December 2016, the Company entered into a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (the “Purchaser”), under which the Company agreed to sell to the Purchaser all of the outstanding equity interests in the Company’s wholly owned indirect subsidiaries PerkinElmer Medical Holdings, Inc. and Dexela Limited, together with certain assets of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the Company’s business of designing, manufacturing and marketing flat panel x-ray detectors, and related software, accessories and ancillary products, to x-ray system manufacturers (the “Medical Imaging Business”), for cash consideration of approximately

$276.0 million

and the Purchaser’s assumption of specified liabilities relating to the Medical Imaging Business (collectively, the “Transaction”). The Medical Imaging Business had been reported in the Diagnostics segment. The Agreement contemplates that the Purchaser will finance the Transaction through a debt financing and that, except as determined otherwise by the Purchaser, the closing will occur no earlier than April 2017. However, the closing of the Transaction is not conditioned upon the receipt of any such financing. The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of specified antitrust waiting periods. The Agreement contains certain termination rights of the Company and the Purchaser and provides that under specified circumstances, upon termination of the Agreement, the Purchaser will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of up to

$22.1 million

. The pending sale of the Medical Imaging Business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities related to the Medical Imaging Business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and its results of operations are classified as income from discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Financial information in this report relating to

fiscal years 2015 and 2014

has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this discontinued operation.

In May 2014, the Company approved the shutdown of microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States, which had been reported within our Diagnostics segment. The Company determined that, with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers, the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market. The shutdown of the microarray-based diagnostic testing laboratory in the United States resulted in a

$0.1 million

net pre-tax

gain

primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets, which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014.

In August 1999, the Company sold the assets of its Technical Service business. The Company recorded pre-tax gain (losses) of

$1.8 million

in

fiscal year 2016

,

$(0.03) million

in

fiscal year 2015

and

$(0.2) million

in

fiscal year 2014

for a contingency related to this business. These gain (losses) were recognized as a gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes.

Note 4: Restructuring and Contract Termination Charges, Net

The Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of the Company's operations with its growth strategy, the integration of its business units and its productivity initiatives. The current portion of restructuring and contract termination charges is recorded in accrued restructuring and contract termination charges and the long-term portion of restructuring and contract termination charges is recorded in long-term liabilities. The activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges, net, as applicable, and are included as a component of income from continuing operations.

The Company implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth product lines (the "Q3 2016 Plan"). The Company implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets (the "Q2 2016 Plan"). The Company implemented restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the second and first quarters of fiscal year 2014 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets (the "Q4 2015 Plan", "Q2 2014 Plan", and "Q1 2014 Plan", respectively). The Company implemented restructuring plans in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives (the "Q2 2015 Plan" and "Q3 2014 Plan", respectively). All other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate the Company's businesses in order to realign operations, reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with the Company's growth strategy (the "Previous Plans").

The following table summarizes the number of employees reduced, the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment, and the dates by which payments were substantially completed, or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed, for restructuring actions implemented during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

in continuing operations:

The Company expects to make payments under the Previous Plans for remaining residual lease obligations, with terms varying in length, through fiscal year

for interest and

$0.2 million

for penalties in its total tax provision due to settlements and statutes of limitations that had lapsed. At

January 1, 2017

, the Company had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of

$29.6 million

, of which

$27.9 million

, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect discontinued operations.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately

$4.6 million

of its uncertain tax positions at

January 1, 2017

, including accrued interest and penalties, and net of tax benefits, may be resolved over the next twelve months as a result of lapses in applicable statutes of limitations and potential settlements. Various tax years after


remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations, such as Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction.

A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:

The variation in the Company's effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, predominantly Singapore, Finland, and China, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, resulting in a benefit from income taxes of

$45.8 million

in

fiscal year 2016

,

$34.2 million

were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The components of net deferred tax assets as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

were recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:

At

January 1, 2017

, for income tax return purposes the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of

$27.7 million

, state net operating loss carryforwards of

$211.9 million

, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of

$227.2 million

, state tax credit carryforwards of

$10.7 million

, general business tax credit carryforwards of

$33.1 million

, and foreign tax credit carryforwards of

$5.7 million

. These are subject to expiration in years ranging from


to


, and without expiration for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain state credit carryforwards.

Valuation allowances take into consideration limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the likely net realizable amount. The Company regularly evaluates positive and negative evidence available to determine if valuation allowances are required or if existing valuation allowances are no longer required. Valuation allowances have been provided on state net operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards and on certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. The decrease in the valuation allowance in

fiscal year 2016

is primarily due to a decrease in tax attributes that the Company does not expect to realize for one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The increase in valuation allowance of

$11.9 million

in

fiscal year 2015

is primarily due to an increase in tax attributes that the Company does not expect to realize for two of its non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The components of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

were as follows:

Taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that the Company considers indefinitely reinvested because the Company plans to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where the Company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost. The Company's indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of its U.S. and non-U.S. operations. As of

January 1, 2017

, the amount of foreign earnings that the Company has the intent and ability to keep invested outside the U.S. indefinitely and for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was approximately

$1.1 billion

. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.



Note 7:

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations for the fiscal years ended:

Antidilutive securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share and could become dilutive in the future.

Note 12:

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

The Company tests goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually for possible impairment. Accordingly, the Company completes the annual testing of impairment for goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. In addition to its annual test, the Company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or non-amortizing intangible assets.

The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company performed its annual impairment testing for its reporting units as of

January 4, 2016

, its annual impairment date for

fiscal year 2016

. The Company concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment, and the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than

20.0%

for each reporting unit. The long-term terminal growth rate for the Company’s reporting units was

3.0%

for the

fiscal year 2016

impairment analysis. The range for the discount rates for the reporting units was

10.5%

to

13.2%

. Keeping all other variables constant, a

10.0%

change in any one of the input assumptions for the various reporting units would still allow the Company to conclude, based on the first step of the process, that there was no impairment of goodwill.

The Company has consistently employed the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. Cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years. The income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. The long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with the Company’s historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect the long-term terminal growth rates of the Company. The Company corroborates the income approach with a market approach.

As discussed in Note 23, the Company realigned its organization into two new operating segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. In conjunction with the realignment of its operating segments, the Company also redefined its reporting units based on the new operating segments. Financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes in the Company's operating segments. The Company's segment management reviews the results of the operations one level below its operating segments. The Company has determined that the reporting units that should be used to test goodwill for impairment are environmental health excluding food, food, life sciences and technology, informatics, OneSource, diagnostics excluding cord blood, cord blood and medical imaging. The income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow model, was used to determine the fair values of each of the reporting units in order to allocate goodwill on a relative fair value basis. As a result of the realignment, the Company reallocated goodwill of

$125.8 million

from its life sciences and technology reporting unit to the diagnostics excluding cord blood reporting unit based on the relative fair value, determined using the income approach, of the applied genomics business as of October 3, 2016.

As of January 2, 2017, the Company's Informatics reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of

$211.0 million

, had a fair value that was less than 20% but greater than 10% more than its carrying value. Informatics is at increased risk of an impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due to a highly competitive industry. Despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit, the Company does not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of this reporting unit that would lead to a material impairment charge.

The Company has consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of its non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. The Company performed its annual impairment testing as of

January 4, 2016

, and concluded that there was no impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets. An assessment of the recoverability of amortizing intangible assets takes place when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. No such events occurred during the

fiscal year 2016

.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

are as follows:

The Company entered into a strategic agreement in fiscal year 2012 under which it acquired certain intangible assets and received a license to certain core technology for an analytics and data discovery platform, as well as the exclusive right to distribute the platform in certain scientific research and development markets. During fiscal year 2012, the Company paid

$6.8 million

for net intangible assets and

$25.0 million

for prepaid royalties. During fiscal year 2013, the Company extended the existing agreement for an additional year. In addition, the Company entered into a new agreement to expand the distribution rights to the clinical and other related markets and acquired additional intangible assets. During fiscal year 2013, the Company paid

$7.0 million

for net intangible assets and

$40.3 million

for prepaid royalties. During fiscal year 2016, the Company extended the existing agreement for an additional 3 years and expanded the distribution rights to the related markets. During fiscal year 2016, the Company paid

$6.0 million

for prepaid royalties related to the extension and new agreement. During the

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

, the Company paid

$9.4 million

and

$9.8 million

, respectively, for additional prepaid royalties. The prepaid royalties have been recorded primarily as other long-term assets. The Company expects to pay

$7.5 million

of additional prepaid royalties within the next twelve months. The Company expenses royalties as revenue is recognized. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company has reported the amortization of these intangible assets within the results of the Company's Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment from the execution date.

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

On August 11, 2016, the Company terminated its previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five year term and an expansion of borrowing capacity from

$700.0 million

to

$1.0 billion

. The new senior unsecured revolving credit facility



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provides for

$1.0 billion

of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of

August 11, 2021

. As of

January 1, 2017

, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of

$11.4 million

were treated as issued and outstanding when calculating the borrowing availability under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of

January 1, 2017

, the Company had

$988.6 million

available for additional borrowing under the facility. The Company uses the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate or the base rate at the time of borrowing, plus a margin. The base rate is the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) an adjusted one-month Libor plus 1.00%. As of

January 1, 2017

, the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility had no outstanding borrowings, and

$4.3 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of

January 3, 2016

, the previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an aggregate carrying value of

$479.6 million

, which was net of

$2.4 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs. The credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. The financial covenants include a debt-to-capital ratio that remains applicable for so long as the Company's debt is rated as investment grade. In the event that the Company's debt is not rated as investment grade, the debt-to-capital ratio covenant is replaced with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant.

Prior to April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2026 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2026 Notes being redeemed, discounted on an annual basis, at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) plus 35 basis points; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time on or after April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2026 Notes, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes due to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2026 Notes below investment grade, the Company will, in certain circumstances, make an offer to purchase the 2026 Notes at a price equal to

101%

of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Financing Lease Obligations.

In fiscal year 2012, the Company entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that the Company is currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. The Company provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, and as a result the Company was considered the owner



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of the buildings during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, the Company was not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. The Company is therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for the Company and non-cash investing and financing activities. As a result, the Company capitalized

$29.3 million

in property, plant and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. The Company has also capitalized

$11.5 million

in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings, which were funded by the lessors, with a corresponding increase to debt. At

January 1, 2017

, the Company had

$37.1 million

recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which

$1.2 million

was recorded as short-term debt and

$35.9 million

was recorded as long-term debt. At

January 3, 2016

, the Company had

$38.2 million

recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which

$1.1 million

was recorded as short-term debt and

$37.1 million

was recorded as long-term debt. The buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.

Pension Plans:

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees and non-U.S. pension plans for certain non-U.S. employees. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new hires effective January 31, 2001, and benefits for those employed by the Company’s former Life Sciences business were frozen as of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of March 2003 for those employed by the Company’s former Analytical Instruments business and corporate employees. Plan benefits were frozen as of January 31, 2011 for all remaining employees that were still actively accruing in the plan. The plans provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation near retirement.

Net periodic pension cost for U.S. and non-U.S. plans included the following components for fiscal years ended:

During fiscal year 2014, the Company notified certain employees of its intention to terminate their employment as part of the Q3 2014 restructuring plan. During fiscal year 2015, the termination of these participants decreased the expected future service lives in excess of the curtailment limit for one of the Company's pension plans, which resulted in a curtailment gain. The Company recorded the curtailment gain of

$0.8 million

during fiscal year 2015. As part of the curtailment, the Company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the plan that had the curtailment based upon current discount rates and the fair value of the pension plan's assets as of the curtailment date, which resulted in an actuarial loss of

$0.8 million

.

Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost during the year were as follows:

The following table provides a breakdown of the non-U.S. benefit obligations and fair value of assets for pension plans that have benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:

Assets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocations as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, and target asset allocations for

fiscal year 2017

are as follows:

The Company maintains target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments.

The Company’s expected rate of return on assets assumptions are derived from management’s estimates, as well as other information compiled by management, including studies that utilize customary procedures and techniques. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.

The Company's discount rate assumptions are derived from a range of factors, including a yield curve for certain plans, composed of the rates of return on high-quality fixed-income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and the related expected duration for the obligations, and a bond matching approach for certain plans.

For the plans in the United States, the Company adopted the updated projection scale, MP-2015, that was published by the Society of Actuaries in 2015, as of January 3, 2016. The adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a

$6.8 million

decrease to the projected benefit obligation as of January 3, 2016. During fiscal year 2016, the Society of Actuaries issued an updated projection scale, MP-2016, which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation. The Company adopted MP-2016 as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a

$5.5 million

decrease to the projected benefit obligation at January 1, 2017. The changes to the projected benefit obligations due to the adoption of the mortality base table and projection scale are included within "Actuarial loss (gain)" in the Change in Benefit Obligations for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 above

Valuation techniques utilized need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There have been no changes in the methodologies utilized at

January 1, 2017

compared to

January 3, 2016

. The following is a description of the valuation techniques utilized to measure the fair value of the assets shown in the table above.

Equity Securities:

Shares of registered investment companies that are publicly traded are categorized as Level 1 assets; they are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of the fund. These instruments have active markets.

Equity index funds are mutual funds that are not publicly traded and are comprised primarily of underlying equity securities that are publicly traded on exchanges. Price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily observable and available. Equity index funds are categorized as Level 2 assets.

Fixed Income Securities:

Fixed income mutual funds that are publicly traded are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of securities held by the fund and are categorized as Level 1 assets.

Fixed income index funds that are not publicly traded are stated at net asset value as determined by the issuer of the fund based on the fair value of the underlying investments and are categorized as Level 2 assets.

Individual fixed income bonds are categorized as Level 2 assets except where sufficient quoted prices exist in active markets, in which case such securities are categorized as Level 1 assets. These securities are valued using third-party pricing services. These services may use, for example, model-based pricing methods that utilize observable market data as inputs. Broker dealer bids or quotes of securities with similar characteristics may also be used.

Other Types of Investments:

Non-U.S. government index link bond funds are not publicly traded and are stated at net asset value as determined by the issuer of the fund based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Underlying investments consist of bonds in which payment of income on the principal is related to a specific price index and are categorized as Level 2 assets.

Hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds are valued at fair value by using the net asset values provided by the investment managers and are updated, if necessary, using analytical procedures, appraisals, public market data and/or inquiry of the investment managers. The net asset values are determined based upon the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. These other investments invest primarily in readily available marketable securities and allocate gains,



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

losses, and expense to the investor based on the ownership percentage as described in the fund agreements. They are categorized as Level 3 assets.

The Company's policy is to recognize significant transfers between levels at the actual date of the event.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 assets for

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

is as follows:

With respect to plans outside of the United States, the Company expects to contribute

$7.6 million

in the aggregate during fiscal year 2017. During

fiscal year 2016

, the Company contributed

$9.6 million

, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States. During fiscal year 2015, the Company made contributions of

$14.9 million

, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the United States and

$20.0 million

to its defined benefit pension plan in the United States. During fiscal year 2014, the Company contributed

$11.2 million

, in the aggregate, to plans outside of the United States.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

The Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, the projected benefit obligations were

$21.8 million

and

$21.5 million

, respectively. Assets with a fair value of

$1.1 million

and

$0.6 million

, segregated in a trust (which is included in marketable securities and investments on the consolidated balance sheets), were available to meet this obligation as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively. Pension expenses and income for this plan netted to

Postretirement Medical Plans:

The Company provides healthcare benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. Eligible U.S. employees qualify for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities and are available only to pay retiree health benefits.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Net periodic postretirement medical benefit (credit) cost included the following components for the fiscal years ended:

The following table sets forth the changes in the postretirement medical plan’s funded status and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Actuarial assumptions used to determine net cost during the year are as follows:

The Company maintains a master trust for plan assets related to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the U.S. postretirement medical plan. Accordingly, investment policies, target asset allocations and actual asset allocations are the same as those disclosed for the U.S. defined benefit plans.

The fair values of the Company’s plan assets at

January 1, 2017

and

Valuation Techniques:

Valuation techniques are the same as those disclosed for the U.S. defined benefit plans above.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 assets for

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

is as follows:

The Company does

no

t expect to make any contributions to the postretirement medical plan during

fiscal year 2017

.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Deferred Compensation Plans:

During fiscal year 1998, the Company implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, or upon retirement or death. The plan was amended to eliminate deferral elections, with the exception of Company 401(k) excess contributions for eligible participants, for plan years beginning January 1, 2011. Benefit payments under the plan are funded by contributions from participants, and for certain participants, contributions by the Company. The obligations related to the deferred compensation plan totaled

$0.9 million

at

January 1, 2017

and

$1.2 million

at

January 3, 2016

.

Note 16:

Contingencies

The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations of the Company and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company's responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued

$9.9 million

and

$11.8 million

as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which represents its management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. During fiscal year 2014, the Company recorded a benefit of

$2.3 million

for cost reimbursements related to a particular site for monitoring and mitigation activities. The Company's environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several



liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to

ten

years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at

January 1, 2017

should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.

Note 17:

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for certain products usually for a period of

one

year beyond the date of sale. The majority of costs associated with warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the time for service personnel to respond to repair and replacement requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical results, supplemented by management’s expectations of future costs. Warranty reserves are included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.

A summary of warranty reserve activity for the fiscal years ended

January 1, 2017

,

January 3, 2016

and

December 28, 2014

is as follows:

Stock Plans

Stock-Based Compensation:

In addition to the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company utilizes

one

stock-based compensation plan, the 2009 Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). Under the 2009 Plan,

10.0 million

shares of the Company's common stock are authorized for stock option grants, restricted stock awards, performance units and stock grants as part of the Company’s compensation programs. In addition to shares of the Company’s common stock originally authorized for issuance under the 2009 Plan, the 2009 Plan includes shares of the Company’s common stock previously granted under the Amended and Restated 2001 Incentive Plan and the 2005 Incentive Plan that were canceled or forfeited without the shares being issued.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes total pre-tax compensation expense recognized related to the Company’s stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock grants, net of estimated forfeitures, included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

:

The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation was

$10.5 million

in

fiscal year 2016

,

$5.8 million

in

fiscal year 2015

and

$5.4 million

in

fiscal year 2014

. Stock-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were

$0.3 million

and

$0.2 million

as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively. The excess tax benefit recognized from stock compensation, classified as a financing cash activity, was

$2.4 million

in fiscal year 2015.

Stock Options:

The Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of

three

years, and will generally expire

seven

years after the date of grant. Options replaced in association with business combination transactions are generally issued with the same terms of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic exercise experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the fiscal years ended:

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the fiscal year ended

January 1, 2017

There was

$5.6 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted as of

January 1, 2017

. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.8

years.

Restricted Stock Awards:

The Company has awarded shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors at no cost to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction period. The restricted stock and restricted stock units vest through the passage of time, assuming continued employment. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses over the vesting period, which is generally


years. These awards were granted under the Company’s 2009 Plan. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.

The following table summarizes restricted stock award activity for the fiscal year ended

January 1, 2017

:

The fair value of restricted stock awards vested during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

1.4

years.

Performance Units:

The Company’s performance unit program provides a cash award based on the achievement of specific performance criteria. A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three-year performance period. The number of units earned at the end of the performance period is determined by multiplying the number of units granted by a performance factor ranging from

0%

to

200%

. Awards are determined by multiplying the number of units earned by the stock price at the end of the performance period, and are paid in cash and accounted for as a liability based award. The compensation expense associated with these units is recognized over the period that the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The Company granted

72,164

performance units,

66,509

performance units, and

79,463

performance units during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

, respectively. The weighted-average per-share grant-date fair value of performance units granted during

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

was

, there were

190,700

performance units outstanding subject to forfeiture, with a corresponding liability of

$6.1 million

recorded in accrued expenses and long-term liabilities.

Stock Awards:

The Company’s stock award program provides non-employee directors an annual equity award. For

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

the award equaled the number of shares of the Company’s common stock which has an aggregate fair market value of

$100,000

on the date of the award. The stock award is prorated for non-employee directors who



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

serve for only a portion of the year. The compensation expense associated with these stock awards is recognized when the stock award is granted. In

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

, each non-employee director was awarded

1,821

shares,

1,953

shares, and

$0.8 million

.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

In April 1999, the Company’s shareholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating employees have the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to

95%

of the closing price on the last day of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed

10%

of the employee’s base compensation. During

fiscal year 2016

, the Company issued

49,578

shares of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted-average price of

Note 20:

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and has policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately

60%

of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed

12 months

, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows.

Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen and Singapore Dollar. The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling

$137.5 million

at

January 1, 2017

,

$127.3 million

at

January 3, 2016

, and

$95.0 million

at

December 28, 2014

, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally


days or less during each of

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

.

In addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance its acquisitions, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Company records these hedges at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows.

As of

January 1, 2017

, the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, that were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined Euro notional amounts of

€58.6 million

, combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of

$8.7 million

and combined Swedish Krona notional amounts of

kr969.5 million

. The combined Euro notional amounts of these outstanding hedges was

€107.4 million

as of

January 3, 2016

. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for each of the

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

. The Company paid

$1.9 million

and received

$18.7 million

during the

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

, respectively, from the settlement of these hedges.

During

fiscal year 2016

, the Company entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of

€492.3 million

to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges were included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), which offsets the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses



will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. The foreign currency forward contracts were settled during the third quarter of 2016 and the Company recorded a net realized foreign exchange gain in AOCI amounting to

$1.8 million

during

fiscal year 2016

.

During the

fiscal year 2016

, in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company designated the 2026 Notes to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges will be included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, which will offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of

January 1, 2017

, the total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was

€495.8 million

. The unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in AOCI related to the net investment hedge was

$23.8 million

for the

fiscal year 2016

.

The Company does

no

t expect any material net pre-tax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into interest and other expense, net within the next twelve months.

Note 21:

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, derivatives, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of

January 1, 2017

.

The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during

fiscal years 2016 and 2015

. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of marketable securities, derivative contracts used to hedge the Company’s currency risk, and acquisition related contingent consideration. The Company has not elected to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value.

Valuation Hierarchy:

The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required to measure fair value. For Level 1 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices as these instruments have active markets. For Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or utilizes alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. For Level 3 inputs, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based on the best information available, including estimates by management primarily based on information provided by third-party fund managers, independent brokerage firms and insurance companies. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible.

The following tables show the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

classified in one of the three classifications described above:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Level 1 and Level 2 Valuation Techniques:

The Company’s Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities are comprised of investments in equity and fixed-income securities as well as derivative contracts. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including common stock price quotes, foreign exchange forward prices and bank price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities.

Marketable securities:

Include equity and fixed-income securities measured at fair value using the quoted market prices in active markets at the reporting date.

Foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities:

Include foreign exchange derivative contracts that are valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date. The Company’s foreign exchange derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements that allow the Company and its counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled under these arrangements have been presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheet on a net basis and are recorded in other assets. As of both

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, none of the master netting arrangements involved collateral.

Level 3 Valuation Techniques:

The Company’s Level 3 liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration related to acquisitions. For liabilities that utilize Level 3 inputs, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 3 liabilities.

Contingent consideration:

Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date using projected milestone dates, discount rates, probabilities of success and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected risk-adjusted contingent payments are discounted back to the current period using a discounted cash flow model.

During fiscal year 2015, the Company acquired all the shares of Vanadis. Under the terms of the acquisition, the initial purchase consideration was

$32.0 million

, net of cash and the Company will be obligated to make potential future milestone payments, based on completion of a proof of concept, regulatory approvals and product sales, of up to

$93.0 million

ranging from 2016 to 2019. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration included projected milestone dates of


to


, discount rates ranging from

3.1%

to

11.3%

, conditional probabilities of success of each individual milestone ranging from

85%

to

95%

and cumulative probabilities of success for each individual milestone ranging from

53%

to

90%

. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was estimated at

$56.9 million

. During the

fiscal year 2016

, the Company updated the fair value of the contingent consideration and recorded a liability of

$63.2 million

as of

January 1, 2017

. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration as of

January 1, 2017

included projected milestone dates of


to


, discount rates ranging from

1.9%

to

8.5%

, conditional probabilities of success of each individual milestone ranging from

90%

to

95%

and cumulative probabilities of success for each individual milestone ranging from

65.8%

to

95%

. A significant delay in the product development (including projected regulatory milestone) achievement date in isolation could result in a significantly lower fair value measurement; a significant acceleration in the product development (including projected regulatory milestone) achievement date in isolation would not have a material impact on the fair value measurement; a significant change in the discount rate in isolation would not have a material impact on the fair value measurement; and a significant change in the probabilities of success in isolation could result in a significant change in fair value measurement.

The fair values of contingent consideration are calculated on a quarterly basis based on a collaborative effort of the Company’s regulatory, research and development, operations, finance and accounting groups, as appropriate. Potential valuation adjustments are made as additional information becomes available, including the progress towards achieving proof of concept, regulatory approvals and revenue targets as compared to initial projections, the impact of market competition and market landscape shifts from non-invasive prenatal testing products, with the impact of such adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of

January 1, 2017

, the Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to

$84.6 million

. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed


years from the respective acquisition dates, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at

January 1, 2017

was

1.75

years.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 net liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. If measured at fair value, cash and cash equivalents would be classified as Level 1.

As of

January 1, 2017

, the Company’s new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides for

$1.0 billion

of revolving loans, had

no

outstanding borrowings. As of

January 3, 2016

, the Company's previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility had

$482.0 million

of borrowings outstanding, which excluded

$2.4 million

unamortized debt issuance costs and letters of credit. The interest rate on the Company’s new senior unsecured revolving credit facility is reset at least monthly to correspond to variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. The Company had no change in credit standing during

fiscal year 2016

. Consequently, the borrowing value of the current year and prior year credit facilities approximate fair value and would be classified as Level 2.

The Company's 2021 Notes, with a face value of

$500.0 million

, had an aggregate carrying value of

$495.8 million

, net of

$1.7 million

of unamortized original issue discount and

$2.5 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs as of

January 1, 2017

. The 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of

$495.1 million

, net of

$2.0 million

of unamortized original issue discount and

$2.9 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs as of

January 3, 2016

. The 2021 Notes had a fair value of

$539.2 million

and

$518.9 million

as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively. The fair value of the 2021 Notes is estimated using market quotes from brokers and is based on current rates offered for similar debt.

The Company's 2026 Notes, with a face value of

€500.0 million

, had an aggregate carrying value of

$517.8 million

, net of

$4.5 million

of unamortized original issue discount and

$4.8 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs as of

January 1, 2017

. The 2026 Notes had a fair value of

€507.5 million

as of

January 1, 2017

. The fair value of the 2026 Notes is estimated using market quotes from brokers and is based on current rates offered for similar debt.

The Company's financing lease obligations had an aggregate carrying value of

$37.1 million

and

$38.2 million

as of

January 1, 2017

and

January 3, 2016

, respectively. The carrying values of the Company's financing lease obligations approximated their fair value as there has been minimal change in the Company's incremental borrowing rate.

As of

January 1, 2017

, the 2021 Notes, 2026 Notes and financing lease obligations were classified as Level 2.

As of

January 1, 2017

, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities due to credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to the Company’s derivative assets based on the evaluation of its counterparties’ credit risks.



Note 22:

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing operations for

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

amounted to

$52.0 million

,

$52.4 million

, and

$52.8 million

, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows:

$49.8 million

in fiscal year


,

$33.9 million

in fiscal year


,

$26.0 million

in fiscal year


,

$20.8 million

in fiscal year


,

$16.3 million

in fiscal year


and

$52.1 million

in fiscal year

2022 and thereafter

.

On

August 22, 2013

, the Company sold one of its facilities located in Boston, Massachusetts for net proceeds of

$47.6 million

. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the property, the Company entered into a lease agreement to lease back the property for its continued use. The lease has an initial term of

15 years

and the Company has the right to extend the term of the lease for two additional periods of ten years each. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease and at the transaction date the Company had deferred

$26.5 million

of gains which are being amortized in operating expenses over the initial lease term of

15 years

. The Company amortized

$1.8 million

of the deferred gains related to the lease during each of the

fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014

. The deferred gains remaining to be amortized were

$20.6 million

at

January 1, 2017

, of which

$1.8 million

was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and

$18.8 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities. The deferred gains remaining to be amortized were

$22.3 million

at

January 3, 2016

, of which

$1.8 million

was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and

$20.5 million

was recorded in long-term liabilities.

Note 23:

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information

The Company discloses information about its operating segments based on the way that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and operating income. Intersegment revenue and transfers are not significant. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1.

Effective October 3, 2016, the Company realigned its businesses to better position the Company to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with the Company's core product offerings. Diagnostics became a standalone operating segment and the Company formed a new operating segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions. The results reported for

fiscal year 2016

reflect this new alignment of the Company's operating segments. Financial information in this report relating to

fiscal years 2015 and 2014

has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to the Company's operating segments.

The principal products and services of the Company's

two

operating segments are:

•

Discovery & Analytical Solutions

.  Provides products and services targeted towards the environmental, industrial, food, life sciences research and laboratory services markets.

•

Diagnostics

.  Develops diagnostics, tools and applications focused on clinically-oriented customers, especially within the reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and applied genomics markets. The Diagnostics segment serves the diagnostics market.

The Company has included the expenses for its corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. The Company has a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in the Company’s calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of the Company’s operating segments.

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

January 1, 2017

. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

January 1, 2017

, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

January 1, 2017

. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of

January 1, 2017

, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

January 1, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

January 1, 2017

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended

January 1, 2017

of the Company and our report dated

February 28, 2017

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
