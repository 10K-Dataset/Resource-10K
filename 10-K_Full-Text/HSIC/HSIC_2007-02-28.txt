PART I

ITEM 1. Business

General

We believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to
office-based healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. We
serve more than 500,000 customers worldwide, including dental practitioners and laboratories,
physician practices and animal health clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We
believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our 75 years of experience distributing
healthcare products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 11,000 people and have operations
in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France,
Austria, Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel,
Australia and New Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve
our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad
product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service,
enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also
allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The
healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical (including animal health)
and international operating segments. Products distributed include consumable products, small
equipment, laboratory products, large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals,
vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves approximately 85% of the estimated 135,000 office-based dental
practices in the combined United States and Canadian dental market. Based upon an estimated $5.5
billion combined United States and Canadian dental market, we estimate our share of this market was
approximately 38% in 2006.

Our
medical group serves approximately 45% of the estimated 250,000 office-based physician
practices, as well as surgical centers and other alternate-care settings throughout the United
States. We also serve over 75% of the estimated 26,000 animal health clinics in the United States.
Based upon an estimated $8.5 billion combined market, we estimate our share of this market was
approximately 17% in 2006.

Our international group serves approximately 240,000 practices in 17 countries outside of
North America and is what we believe to be a leading European healthcare supplier serving
office-based practices. Based upon an estimated $8.0 billion European combined dental, medical and
animal health market in which we operate, we estimate our share of this market was approximately
15% in 2006.

Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to
healthcare practitioners, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice
solutions include practice-management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and
animal health clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and
continuing education services for practitioners.



Industry

The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based healthcare
practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental,
medical and animal health markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $22.0 billion
in 2006 in the combined North American and European markets. The industry ranges from sole
practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations
ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or
otherwise associated their practices.

Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage
large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small
equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent,
small-quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.
The purchasing decisions within an office-based healthcare practice are typically made by the
practitioner or an administrative assistant. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased
from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging
population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing,
new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage. In addition, the
physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from
hospitals to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices. As the cosmetic surgery and
elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are increasingly performing more of these
procedures in their offices and other alternate-care settings. The elder-care market continues to
benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly Americans.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of
distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine
with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue
to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and
service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Competition

The distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive.
Many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number
of suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to
market particular products. Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and
thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.

In North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers of
dental, medical and animal health products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product
line, customer service and value-added products and services. In the sale of our dental products,
our primary competitors are Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company. In
addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional
and local level. Our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are PSS World Medical,
Inc., the General Medical division of McKesson Corp. and the Allegiance division of Cardinal
Health, Inc., which are national distributors. In the animal health market, our primary
competitors are Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC, MWI Veterinary
Supply Inc., Animal Health International, Inc. and the Webster
Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc. We also compete against a number of regional and
local medical and animal health distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that sell
directly to physicians and veterinarians. With regard to our dental practice management software,
we compete against numerous companies, including PracticeWorks, Inc., which was recently
acquired by a subsidiary of the Onex Corporation, and Patterson Companies, Inc. In the animal
health practice management market, our primary competitor is IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. The medical practice management and
electronic medical records market is very fragmented and therefore we
compete against numerous companies such as Misys plc Healthcare
Systems and Quality System’s, Inc.’s NextGen Healthcare Information Systems divisions.



We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price
and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG &
Co., Planmeca Oy, Omega Pharma NV and Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., as well as a large number
of dental, medical and animal health product distributors and manufacturers in the United Kingdom,
the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Australia, New Zealand,
Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.

Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our
prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results.

Competitive Strengths

We have 75 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners resulting
in strong awareness of the “Henry Schein” name. Our competitive strengths include:

Direct sales and marketing expertise

. Our sales and marketing efforts are
designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal
visits by field sales representatives, frequent direct marketing and telesales
contact, emphasizing our broad product lines, including exclusive distribution
agreements, competitive prices and ease of order placement. The key elements
of our direct sales and marketing efforts are:

•

Field sales consultants

. We have approximately 2,425 field sales
consultants, including equipment sales specialists, covering major
North American and international markets. These consultants
complement our direct marketing and telesales efforts and enable us to
better market, service and support the sale of more sophisticated
products and equipment.

•

Direct marketing

. During 2006, we distributed more than 35 million
pieces of direct marketing material, including catalogs, flyers, order
stuffers and other promotional materials to existing and potential
office-based healthcare customers.

•

Telesales

. We support our direct marketing effort with approximately
1,375 inbound and outbound telesales representatives, who facilitate
order processing and generate new sales through direct and frequent
contact with customers.

Broad product and service offerings at competitive prices

. We offer a broad
range of products and services to our customers, at competitive prices, in the
following categories:

•

Consumable supplies and equipment

. We offer over 70,000 Stock Keeping
Units (“SKUs”) to our customers. Of the SKUs offered, approximately
42,000 are offered to our dental customers, approximately 35,000 to
our medical customers and approximately 23,000 to our animal health
customers. We offer over 100,000 additional SKUs to our customers in
the form of special order items.

•

Technology and other value-added products and services

. We sell
practice management software systems to our dental, medical and animal
health customers. Our practice management software products provide
practitioners with patient treatment history, billing, accounts
receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars, electronic
claims processing and word processing programs. As of December 30,
2006, more than 50,000 of our Dentrix

®

, Easy Dental

®

, Enterprise,
Labnet (dental laboratory), EMR (medical) and our AVImark

®

(animal
health) software systems were installed.



•

Repair services

. We have 170 equipment sales and service centers
worldwide that provide a variety of repair services for our healthcare
customers. Our technicians provide installation and repair services
for dental handpieces; dental, medical and animal health small
equipment; table top sterilizers; and large dental equipment.

•

Financial services

. We offer our customers assistance in operating
their practices by providing access to a number of financial services
and products at rates that we believe are generally lower than what
they would be able to secure independently.

Commitment to superior customer service

. We maintain a strong commitment to
providing superior customer service. We frequently monitor our customer
service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical reports. Our
customer service policy primarily focuses on:

•

Exceptional order fulfillment

. Approximately 99% of items ordered in
the United States and Canada are shipped without back ordering and are
shipped on the same business day the order is received.

•

Streamlined ordering process

. Customers may place orders 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week (“24/7”) by mail, fax, telephone, e-mail, Internet
and by using our computerized order entry systems.

Integrated management information systems

. Our information systems generally
allow for centralized management of key functions, including accounts
receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales and order
fulfillment. These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior
customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and
monitor daily operational statistics.

Cost-effective purchasing

. We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key
element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a low-cost provider of
healthcare products. We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and
suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest
possible cost. In 2006, our top 10 healthcare distribution suppliers and our
single largest supplier accounted for approximately 30% and 7% of our aggregate
purchases.

Efficient distribution

. We distribute our products from our strategically
located distribution centers. We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels
in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order
fulfillment. These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid
of our management information systems. Once an order is entered, it is
electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s
location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order
fulfillment.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to continue to expand as a value-added distributor of healthcare products and
services to office-based healthcare practitioners. To accomplish this, we will apply our
competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:

•

Increase penetration of our existing customer base

. We intend to
increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our
position as their primary supplier. In the North American dental
market, total consumable sales per practitioner are estimated to be
approximately $29,000, compared to our average dental customer’s
sales of approximately $12,000 (or 42%). In the U.S. medical
market, total sales per practitioner are estimated to be
approximately $12,000, compared to our average U.S. medical
customer’s sales of approximately $4,500 (or 38%). In the European
dental market, total sales per practitioner are estimated to be
approximately $23,000, compared to our average European dental
customer’s sales of approximately $6,600 (or 29%).

•

Increase the number of customers we serve

. This strategy includes
increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as
well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts.

•

Leverage our value-added products and services

. We intend to increase
cross-selling efforts for key product lines. In the dental business,
we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental
practice management software users and our dental distribution
customers. In the medical business, we



have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to medical
distribution customers, as well as cross-selling core products with
these key products. In the animal health business, we have
opportunities to sell several major new pharmaceutical lines to
existing customers, as well as cross-selling opportunities from our
dental sales expertise.

•

Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures

. Our acquisition
strategy includes acquiring entities with businesses complementary to
ours that will provide, among other things, additional sales to be
channeled through our existing distribution infrastructure, access to
additional product lines and networks of field sales consultants and
an opportunity to further expand internationally.

Markets Served

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is
increasingly using healthcare services. Between 2006 and 2016, the 45 and older population is
expected to grow by approximately 18%. Between 2006 and 2026, this age group is expected to grow
by approximately 32%. This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of 9% between
2006 and 2016 and 18% between 2006 and 2026.

In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral healthcare expenditures as
this segment of the population increases. Cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental
practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions that patients seek. At
the same time, there is an increase in dental insurance coverage. Approximately 55% of the U.S.
population now has some form of dental coverage, up from 47% in 1995.

We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through
important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims
processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a
practitioner’s efficiency.

There continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’
offices, a trend that provides additional opportunities for us. There also is the continuing use
of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings. We believe we have
established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner.

We believe our international group is a leading European healthcare supplier servicing
office-based dental, medical and animal health practices. We are in the process of implementing
SAP Software across Europe. Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model throughout Europe
and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist. Through our “Schein Direct”
program, we have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in
over 200 countries around the world.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed
the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of
seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing
patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end promotions. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the
prior two quarters. Quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other
factors, including:

•

costs of developing new applications and services;



Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or
quarterly operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet market
expectations, our stock price may decline.

Governmental Regulations

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and foreign
governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical
devices. Among the federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and the Safe
Medical Devices Act of 1990, as amended, and comparable foreign regulations.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally regulates the introduction, manufacture,
advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, marketing and distribution of, and record
keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce.

The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of
prescription drugs, including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be registered with
the Secretary of Health and Human Services and be licensed by each state in which they conduct
business, and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage, handling and
record maintenance. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, which also amended the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, imposes certain reporting and record-keeping requirements in the event of
incidents involving serious injury, illness or death caused by a medical device distributed by us.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are
required to obtain a registration annually from the Attorney General in accordance with specified
rules and regulations and are subject to inspection by the Drug Enforcement Administration acting
on behalf of the Attorney General. We are required to maintain licenses and permits for the
distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under the laws of the states in which
we operate. Our customers are also subject to significant governmental regulation.



Certain of our businesses are required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and
comply with operating and security standards of, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration,
United States Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, and
various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well
as foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and
location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale. These businesses include those that
distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices, or
own pharmacy operations. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Food and
Drug Administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the
ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative
sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse,
referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Such laws
prohibit, among other things, persons from soliciting, offering,
receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering or purchasing of items or
services that are paid for by government health care programs. The fraud and abuse laws and
regulations are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation. Certain of our
businesses also maintain contracts with the federal government and are subject to certain
regulatory requirements relating to government contractors.

Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state and local laws and
regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, handling and disposal of hazardous
or potentially hazardous substances. In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and
regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel. For example, certain
states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by paperwork
tracing drugs back to the manufacturers. There have been increasing efforts by various levels of
government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction
of counterfeit, adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. At the
federal level, the Federal Food and Drug Administration issued final regulations pursuant to the
Prescription Drug Marketing Act that became effective in December 2006. The regulations impose
pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs and/or burden to us of
selling our product and handling product returns. In early December 2006, the federal District
Court for the Eastern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily enjoining
the implementation of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors. We
cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding.

In addition, United States and international import and export laws and regulations require us
to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products. Certain of
our businesses also may be subject to federal and state requirements relating to the protection and
privacy of health or other personal information. We also are subject to certain laws and
regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and
records.

While we believe that we are compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated
thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business,
there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will
not have a material adverse impact on our business.



Proprietary Rights

We hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein” name and logo, as well as certain other
trademarks. Pursuant to agreements executed in connection with our reorganization in 1994, both
Henry Schein, Inc. and Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. (which was acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. in 2000), a company previously engaged in the manufacture and distribution of multi-source
pharmaceutical products, are entitled to use the “Schein” name in connection with their respective
businesses, but Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. is not entitled to use the name “Henry Schein.” We
intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.

Employees

As of December 30, 2006, we employed more than 11,000 full-time employees, including
approximately 1,375 telesales representatives, 2,425 field sales consultants, including equipment
sales specialists, 1,875 warehouse employees, 950 computer programmers and technicians, 975
management employees and 3,800 office, clerical and administrative employees. Approximately 453 or
4.1% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our
relations with our employees are excellent.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

The healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to
compete successfully.

We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.
Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow
them to compete more successfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our
customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive
rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers also
could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role
and that of other distributors. Industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors, the
unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to
interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors also could increase
competition. In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may
reduce our revenues.

The healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and
regulatory influences. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change
driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including the reduction of spending budgets by
government and private insurance programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and corporate health
insurance plans; pressures relating to potential healthcare reform; trends toward managed care;
consolidation of healthcare distribution companies; consolidation of healthcare manufacturers;
collective purchasing arrangements among office-based healthcare practitioners; and changes in
reimbursements to customers. If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in
the healthcare industry, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, the
enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

We must comply with government regulations governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and
medical devices, and additional regulations could negatively affect our business.

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international
governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical
devices. Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and
the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, as amended. Such laws:

•

regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, handling, record keeping, manufacturing and advertising of drugs and
medical devices;

•

subject us to inspection by the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration;

•

regulate the transportation of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;

•

require registration with the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration;

•

require us to coordinate returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall
procedures; and

•

impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.



Applicable federal and state laws and regulations also may require us to meet various
standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing
practices, product supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy of health
or other personal information, and the importation and exportation of products. Our
business also is subject to requirements of foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our
operations abroad.

The failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws
and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect
our business. There can be no assurance that current or future United States or foreign government
regulations will not adversely affect our business. The costs to us associated with complying with
the various applicable federal and state statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they
may be modified, could be material. Allegations by a state or the federal government that we have
not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. If it is
determined that we have not complied with these laws, or if we enter into settlement agreements to
resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be
subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses or our ability to
participate in federal and state healthcare programs. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse impact on our businesses. We believe that the healthcare services industry will continue
to be subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and local levels and that we have
adequate compliance programs and controls to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect to healthcare fraud, we could suffer
penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and
regulations relating to healthcare fraud. The federal government continues to strengthen its
position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting government healthcare
programs. Our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our
business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, (i) prohibit persons
from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of
a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in
any way paid for by government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of
restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government
healthcare programs. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable
laws, many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been
interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or
judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties,
including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare
programs.

Our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our
operating results.

International operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks that our international
operations are subject to include:

•

difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;

•

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;

•

repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;

•

regulatory requirements;



•

unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;

•

imposition of import/export duties, quotas, sanctions or penalties; and

•

unexpected regulatory, economic and political changes in foreign markets.

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the
expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of
seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing
patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end promotions. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the
prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other
factors, including:

•

costs of developing new applications and services;

•

costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

•

timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•

loss of sales representatives;

•

general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries;

•

timing of the release of functions of our technology-related products and services;

•

our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;

•

changes in accounting principles;

•

product availability or recalls by manufacturers;

•

exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury; and

•

increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our third-party shippers.

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our
stock price may decline.

Because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are
dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.

We obtain substantially all of our products from third-party suppliers. Generally, we do not
have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us. Therefore,
suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request. Because we do not
control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by
interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control. In the event that any of
our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in
required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely
basis. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on
a timely basis, if at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products, including the
supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product, would have an



adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the
value of our common stock.

Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.

We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint
ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the
future. Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible adverse effects on our
operating results or the market price of our common stock. Some of our acquisitions and future
acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy
certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations. In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:

•

may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;

•

requires significant management attention; and

•

may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources.

There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.
Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the
following:

•

the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;

•

our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust
regulations; and

•

the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions.

Our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.

We are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and assimilating the
operations, services, products and personnel of each company with our management policies,
procedures and strategies. We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth
that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or
expenses in connection with these acquisitions. To effectively manage our expected future growth,
we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve
our operational systems, internal procedures, accounts receivable and management, financial and
operational controls. If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be adversely affected.

We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use
of the products we sell results in injury.

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of
business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical products, medical devices and other healthcare products.
Additionally, we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures dental implants and we are
subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture of
products by that entity. One of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is
liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the supply chain. In addition, some of
the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials. The improper handling
of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to
liability. We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering
risks and in amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in
connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with
indemnification. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient
or will be available in adequate amounts or at



a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate
protection. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered
by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against
us, could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development,
technical support and successful marketing.

Competition among companies supplying practice-management software and/or e-services is
intense and increasing. Our future sales of practice-management software and e-services will
depend on, among other factors:

•

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;

•

our ability to enhance our products and services; and

•

our ability to provide ongoing technical support.

We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software,
software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services
will be released on time or accepted by the market. Our software and applicable e-services
products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced
or as new versions are released. We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software
errors or bugs will not occur. Any such defective software may result in increased expenses
related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such
software. We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections. We cannot
provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our
software or e-services products.

Our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers,
suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with
qualified sales personnel as well as key customers, suppliers and manufacturers. If we fail to
maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such
key persons in the future, our business may suffer.

Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.

Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our
existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
among others. The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our
business. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman. We do not currently have “key man”
life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for senior management is intense, and
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.

Increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our third-party shippers could harm our
business.

Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our
U.S. orders through United Parcel Service, Inc. and other delivery services, and typically bear the
cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse
effect on our operating results. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those
shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver
products on a timely basis.



We may not be able to respond to technological change effectively.

Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by
electronic online commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid
technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of online commerce will
require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to
develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our
clients on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. Our inability to
anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our
business.

We are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates.

In 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed-rate interest
rates for variable interest rates payable on our $210.0 million senior notes. Our fixed interest
rates on the senior notes were 6.9% and 6.7% for the $130.0 million and $80.0 million senior notes,
respectively. The variable rate is comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and resets on the interest
due dates for the senior notes. As a result of these interest rate swap agreements, as well as our
existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements, we are exposed to risk from fluctuations
in interest rates.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a
significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:

•

the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;

•

changes in our industry and competitors;

•

our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;

•

any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in
connection with business acquisitions, restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;

•

the dilutive impact of convertible debt on our earnings per share;

•

general market and economic conditions; and

•

any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.

In addition, the Nasdaq Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that
can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on
Nasdaq. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common
stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in
the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been
instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial
costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources,
which would have an adverse effect on our business.



Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may
discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders
receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.

The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for
a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain
investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions,
among other things:

•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a
merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and

•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to:

•

remove a director; and

•

to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.

In addition, our 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan
and 2001 Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon
a change in control, and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for
increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two
years after a change in control.

We also have a stockholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire us if our Board of Directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate
and in the stockholders’ best interest.

Tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities.

We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and
local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative
initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no
assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In
addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.
Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable
laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not
be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

We have no unresolved comments from the staff of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2006 fiscal year.

The properties listed in the table above are our principal properties primarily used by
our healthcare distribution segment. In addition, we lease numerous other distribution, office,
showroom, manufacturing and sales space in locations including the United States, Canada, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic,
Israel, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. During 2007, we
will commence operations of a new distribution center in Switzerland.

We believe that our properties are in good condition, are well maintained and are suitable and
adequate to carry on our business. We have additional operating capacity at certain distribution
center facilities.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of
business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally
obtain product indemnification from our suppliers.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in
amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate
amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate
protection. In our opinion, all pending matters, including those described below, are covered by
insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

As of December 30, 2006, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we
were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not
material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for
determining estimated losses considers currently available facts,



presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors, including probable
recoveries from third parties.

Product Liability Claims

As of December 30, 2006, we were a defendant in approximately 44 product liability cases. In
many of these cases, the manufacturers have agreed to defend and indemnify us. The manufacturers
have withheld defense indemnification in some of these cases pending product identification. In
our opinion, these cases are covered by insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2006.



PART II

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

Our current share repurchase program, announced on June 21, 2004, originally allowed us to
repurchase up to $100.0 million in shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5%
of the shares outstanding at the commencement of the program. On October 31, 2005, our Board of
Directors authorized an additional $100.0 million of shares in our common stock to be repurchased
under this program. As of December 30, 2006, we had repurchased $128.8 million or 3,373,142 shares
under this initiative, with $71.2 million remaining for future common stock share repurchases.

The following table summarizes repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase

Dividend Policy

We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock during fiscal years 2006 or 2005.
We currently do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future. We intend to retain earnings to finance the expansion of our business and for general
corporate purposes, including our stock repurchase program. Any declaration of dividends will be
at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition,
capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of
dividends and other factors. The agreements governing our senior notes limit the distribution of
dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders (limited to $25.0 million, plus 80% of
cumulative net income, plus net proceeds from the issuance of additional capital stock.) As of
December 30, 2006, the amount of retained earnings free of restrictions was $503.0 million.

During 2004, we recorded a $13.2 million pre-tax ($8.4 million post-tax) charge related to
our Fluvirin

®

contract with Chiron Corporation. This charge, which represented the write-off
of a deferred expense associated with the 2005/2006 influenza season, occurred as a result of
the significant uncertainty about whether Chiron would be able to provide Fluvirin

for the
2005/2006 influenza season. The effect that this charge had on earnings per share for the
year ended December 25, 2004 was $(0.10).

On April 1, 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Hospital Supply Business,
previously reported as part of our healthcare distribution reportable segment. The sale price
was $36.5 million, which was received during the second quarter of 2006. As a result of this
sale, included in the operating results from discontinued operations for 2006 is a $32.3
million ($19.4 million after-tax) loss on the sale, including $3.5 million ($2.1 million
after-tax) of transitional service obligations and selling costs. Also, because the decision
to divest this business was reached in 2005, we recorded an impairment charge to our
long-lived assets of approximately $7.0 million, net of tax, or $(0.08) per diluted share in
2005.

In the third quarter of 2003, we sold PMA Bode GmbH, an X-ray film distribution business located
in Germany, which was a component of our healthcare distribution business. This sale resulted
in a loss of $2.0 million, net of tax, or $(0.02) per diluted share. Due to immateriality, we
have not reflected the operating results, other than the loss on sale, of PMA Bode separately as
a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented. This was partially offset by the
Hospital discontinued operation discussed above.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

In accordance with the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, we provide the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors which, among
others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements,
expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. All forward-looking statements made by
us are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. These
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. These statements are identified by the use of such terms as “may,”
“could,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate” or
other comparable terms.

Risk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from

certain provisions in our governing documents that may discourage third-party acquisitions of us;
and changes in tax legislation that affect us. The order in which these factors appear should not
be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.

We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond
our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied
upon as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no duty and have no obligation to update
forward-looking statements.

Executive Level Overview

We believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to
office-based healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. We
serve more than 500,000 customers worldwide, including dental practitioners and laboratories,
physician practices and animal health clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We
believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our 75 years of experience distributing
healthcare products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 11,000 people and have operations
in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France,
Austria, Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel,
Australia and New Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve
our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad
product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service,
enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also
allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The
healthcare distribution



reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical (including animal health) and international
operating segments. Products distributed include consumable products, small equipment, laboratory
products, large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products,
diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, schools and other institutions in
the combined United States and Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office-based
medical practitioners, surgical centers, other alternate-care settings, animal health clinics and
other institutions throughout the United States. Our international group serves 17 countries
outside of North America and is what we believe to be a leading European healthcare supplier
serving office-based practitioners.

Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to
healthcare practitioners, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice
solutions include practice-management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and
animal health clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and
continuing education services for practitioners.

Industry Overview

In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment. This
trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low
prices. It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts
and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at
competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management
information support. We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to
favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the
efficiency and facilitation of practice management.

Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and
transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to
address significant changes in the healthcare industry, including consolidation of healthcare
distribution companies, potential healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare
and collective purchasing arrangements.

Industry Consolidation

The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based healthcare
practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental,
medical and animal health markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $22.0 billion
in 2006 in the combined North American and European markets. The industry ranges from sole
practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations
ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or
otherwise associated their practices.

Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage
large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small
equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent,
small-quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.
The purchasing decisions within an office-based healthcare practice are typically made by the
practitioner or an administrative assistant. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased
from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of
distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine
with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue
to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and
service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.



Our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products
and services to the healthcare industry. This trend has resulted in expansion into service areas
that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with,
and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.

As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this
trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing
infrastructure. In the U.S. dental market, we estimate that there are currently more than 300
smaller distributors holding over 25% of the market. In the U.S. medical market, we estimate that
more than 500 smaller distributors hold over 50% of the market, and in the European dental market,
we estimate that more than 200 smaller distributors hold over 80% of the market.

As the healthcare industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates
for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a
provider of products and services to the healthcare industry. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if
pursued. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur
merger and acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts
associated with any such transaction would be successful.

Aging Population and Other Market Influences

The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging
population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing,
new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage. In addition, the
physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from
hospitals to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices. As the cosmetic surgery and
elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are increasingly performing more of these
procedures in their offices. The elder-care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth
rate of the population of elderly Americans.

The January 2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census estimated that the elderly population in the United
States will more than double by the year 2040. In 2000, four million Americans were aged 85 or
older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care services. By
the year 2040, that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million. The
population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period.

As a result of these market dynamics, the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue
to increase in the United States. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published
“National Health Care Expenditures Projections: 2005 — 2015” indicating that total national
healthcare spending reached $1.9 trillion in 2004, or 16.0% of the nation’s gross domestic product,
the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the United States. Healthcare
spending is projected to reach $4.0 trillion in 2015, an estimated 20.0% of the nation’s gross
domestic product.

Government Influences

The healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation, licensure and operating
compliance procedures. National healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative
initiatives by Congress. Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large
portion of the total cost of medical care. The Balanced Budget Act passed by Congress in 1997
significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers,
affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (the “Medicare Act”) is the
largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception, and provides participants with
voluntary



prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card. The Medicare Act also
includes provisions relating to medication management programs, generic substitution and provider
reimbursement.

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government, including state
departments of health, state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the
pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated
or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. Certain states have
already adopted laws and regulations, including pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended
to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system. Regulations adopted under the
federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act, effective December, 2006, require the passage of pedigree
information. Other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and
regulations. We continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with
counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation.

Gross profit increased $163.1 million, or 12.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared
to the prior year period. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with
distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable
to other distribution companies. Additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin
percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment. These higher
gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with
the nature of the software industry, in which developers typically realize higher gross margins to
recover investments in research and development.

Healthcare distribution gross profit increased $154.7 million, or 12.4%, for the year ended
December 30, 2006 compared to the prior year period. Healthcare distribution gross profit margin
increased slightly to 27.8% for the year ended December 30, 2006 from 27.5% for the comparable
prior year period.

Technology gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 12.5%, for the year ended December 30, 2006
compared to the prior year period. Technology gross profit margin increased to 76.9% for the year
ended December 30, 2006 from 76.0% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a change
in sales mix reflecting a larger percentage of higher margin electronic and financial services
sales and other cost improvements, largely in technical support.

Other expense, net decreased $7.2 million to $9.3 million for the year ended December 30,
2006 from the comparable prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in
interest income due to higher interest rates and average investment balances, a gain of
approximately $2.0 million associated with a change in accounting for net investment hedging
arrangements (see Note 1 to accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a reduction of
interest expense of approximately $2.8 million representing the interest rate component of our
mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher interest
rates.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 30, 2006, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was
35.6% compared to 36.7% for the prior year period. The difference between our effective tax rates
and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

In the first quarter of 2006 and during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss
of $19.4 million and $11.3 million, net of tax, related to discontinued operations
(see Note 6 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further
discussion).

Net Income

Net income increased $24.0 million, or 17.2%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to

of $19.4 million,
net of taxes. In 2005, net income includes an impairment charge related to long-lived assets
of discontinued operations of $7.0 million, net of tax.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs, acquisitions,
capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock. Working capital requirements generally
result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities, and payment terms for
receivables and payables. Since sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and
special inventory forward buy-in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year,
our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to
the end of the first quarter of the following year.

We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit
facilities, debt placements and stock issuances. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows
from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for, and provision by our
suppliers of, our products and services. Given current operating, economic and industry
conditions, we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the
foreseeable future. We do not expect the loss of cash flows from discontinued operations to have a
material impact on our future liquidity or capital resources.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $235.3 million for the year ended December
30, 2006 compared to $254.8 million for the comparable prior year period. This net change of $19.5
million was due primarily to timing changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by
increased net income. Net cash used in investing activities was $180.4 million for the year ended
December 30, 2006 compared to $206.7 million for the comparable prior year period. Net cash used
in financing activities was $21.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to net cash
used in financing activities of $28.5 million for the prior year period.

We expect to invest approximately $45.0 million to $50.0 million during 2007 in capital
projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems infrastructure and to
integrate certain operations into our core structure.

Adjusted to reflect our reclassification of $43.8 million of variable-rate demand notes
from cash and cash equivalents to available-for-sale securities within our consolidated
balance sheet.

Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds
representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity. At December 30, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, our available-for-sale securities consisted of highly liquid tax-efficient
securities, including primarily auction-rate securities and variable-rate demand notes.

Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to
variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.
Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in
opportunities and our desired level of



inventory. We anticipate future increases in our working
capital requirements as a result of continuing sales growth.

Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations improved to 40.8
days as of December 30, 2006 from 41.8 days as of December 31, 2005. During the year ended
December 30, 2006, we wrote-off approximately $6.6 million of fully reserved accounts receivable
against our trade receivable reserve, which had no effect on our 2006 earnings. Our inventory
turns from continuing operations decreased to 6.8 as of December 30, 2006 from 7.0 as of December
31, 2005.

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate
long-term debt, including interest (assuming an average long-term rate of interest of 5.5%), as

Inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (formerly ID Biomedical Corporation), Novartis AG and the
Sanofi-Aventis Group through 2014 which require us to pay an amount per dose based on the
prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year. The amounts included in the
above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions.

In 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These notes are
senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to mature on
August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, which
commenced on February 15, 2005. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion
ratio of 21.58 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is the
equivalent conversion price of $46.34 per share, under the following circumstances:

•

if the price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion price
measured over a specified number of trading days;

•

during the five business-day period following any 10 consecutive
trading-day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10
trading-day period was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes
during that period;

•

if the notes have been called for redemption; or

•

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate
transactions, as defined in the note agreement.

Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the
principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied
in shares of our common stock. We currently have sufficient availability of funds through our
$300.0 million revolving credit



facility (discussed below) along with cash on hand to fully satisfy
the cash portion of our conversion obligation. We also will pay contingent interest during any
six-month interest period beginning August 20, 2010, if the average trading price of the notes is
above specified levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August 20, 2010. The
note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August 15, 2010, 2014,
2019, 2024 and 2029 or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event.

Our $130.0 million senior notes are due on June 30, 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of
6.9% per annum. On September 25, 2006, we made our first annual principal payment of $20.0 million
on our $100.0 million senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.7% per annum.
Principal payments are due annually on September 25, 2006 through 2010. Interest on both notes is
payable semi-annually.

In 2003, we entered into agreements relating to our $230.0 million senior notes to exchange
their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The value of debt exchanged to a variable
rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes. As of December
30, 2006, there is $210.0 million of principal remaining with a weighted-average interest rate of
8.1%. For the year ended December 30, 2006, the weighted-average variable interest rate was 8.6%.
This weighted-average variable interest rate is comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and resets on the
interest due dates for such senior notes.

On May 24, 2005, we entered into a $300.0 million revolving credit facility with a $100.0
million expansion feature. This facility, which expires in May 2010, replaced our previous
revolving credit facility of $200.0 million, which was scheduled to expire in May 2006. As of
December 30, 2006, there were $8.2 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no
borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility.

On June 21, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a common stock
repurchase program. This program previously allowed us to repurchase up to $100.0 million in
shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5% of the shares outstanding on the
announcement date. On October 31, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100.0
million of shares of our common stock to be repurchased under this program. As of December 30,
2006, we had repurchased $128.8 million or 3,373,142 shares under this initiative, with $71.2
million remaining for future common stock share repurchases.

Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to
require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on third-party
valuations or at a price pursuant to a formula as defined in the agreements, which approximates
fair value. Additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive
additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met. We accrue
liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the
contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.

We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months. Funding
requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion,
may change. Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and
public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with
sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.

E-Commerce

Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by
electronic online commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid
technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of online commerce will
require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to
develop and introduce a variety of new services to



address the changing demands of consumers and
our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.

Through our proprietary, technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety
of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name
recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to
participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways and
means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical data,
when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. However, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and
uncertainties. Reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions,
judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if
different assumptions were to be applied.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with our
audit committee, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our
financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and animal health consumable products, as
well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts,
rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon
historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are
recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped
to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the
product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and
product returns are reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is
completed at the time of delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the
services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate
of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts
receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data,
experience, customer types, credit



worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may
adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect
collectibility. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to
accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments,
estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

Inventory and Reserves

Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out method. In performing our lower of cost
or market valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the
inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.

From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or
other factors expected to affect salability. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or
assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such
judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual
impairment analyses. Such impairment analyses require the comparison of the fair value to the
carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on
valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is
available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. Although we
believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable,
making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect
such impairment analyses and our financial results.

We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments (dental, medical (including animal
health), international and technology). Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the
purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. We assess
the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and on
an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important, which could trigger an interim impairment
review, include:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results;

•

significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business (e.g. decision to divest a business); or

•

significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived
intangible assets are impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement
of income.

Supplier Rebates

Supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are
earned. The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted
inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally
provide for increasing rebates based on
either increased purchase or sales volume. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or
assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments,
estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.



Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade
names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property. When an impairment
exists, the related assets are written down to fair value. Although we believe our judgments,
estimates and/or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes
to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses
and our financial results.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (FAS) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” We previously applied Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations and
provided the required pro forma disclosures of FAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
in our consolidated financial statements. We elected to adopt the modified retrospective
application method provided by FAS 123(R), and accordingly, financial statement amounts for all
prior periods presented herein reflect results as if the fair value method of expensing had been
applied from the original effective date of FAS 123. Such results are consistent with our
previously reported pro forma disclosures required under FAS 123.

We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of
the award. Awards under our equity incentive plans principally include a combination of
at-the-money stock options and restricted stock (including restricted stock units).

We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model which
requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options, stock price volatility,
risk-free interest rates and dividend yields.

We issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipient’s continued service over time
(four-year cliff vesting) and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified
performance measurements (three-year cliff vesting).

With respect to time-based restricted stock, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant
based on our closing stock price. With respect to performance-based restricted stock, the number
of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per
share performance measured against specified targets over a three-year period. We estimate the
fair value of performance-based restricted stock based on our closing stock price assuming that
performance targets will be achieved. Over the performance period, the number of shares of common
stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon our
estimation of achieving such performance targets. The ultimate number of shares delivered to
recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of
the final performance metrics to the specified targets.

Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to stock-based
compensation are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or
assumptions could materially affect our financial results.



Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FAS Interpretation No.
48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”).
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial
statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on future changes, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 and
determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position
or results from operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” FAS 157
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies under other previously issued
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any
new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently
evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 123(R).”
FAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over- or under-funded status of a defined benefit
plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in
that funded status, net of tax through comprehensive income, in the year in which the changes
occur. FAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a defined benefit plan as
of the date of its year end statement of financial position. The provisions of FAS 158 are
effective for our year ended December 30, 2006, with the exception of the requirement to measure
the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of our fiscal year end, which is effective for our
fiscal year ending December 27, 2008. During December 2006, we implemented the requirement to
recognize the funded status of our retirement benefit plans. Recognizing the funded status of our
defined benefit plans did not have a material impact on our statement of financial position.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks, which include changes in interest rates, as well as changes in
foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other. We attempt to
minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap
contracts. These hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and
currency exchange risks. Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include
volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments. All
interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are
components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or
anticipated interest rate and currency exposure. We do not enter into such contracts for
speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We
have fixed rate senior notes of $130.0 million at 6.9% and $80.0 million at 6.7%. During
2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for
variable interest rates. The variable rates are comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and reset on
the interest due dates for the senior notes. As a result of these interest rate swap agreements,
as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements, we are exposed to risk from
changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would
increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.1 million.

As of December 30, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other
current and non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was $6.7 million, which
represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on
market conditions at that time. Changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements
are reflected as an adjustment to current and non-current assets or liabilities with an offsetting
adjustment to the carrying value of the $210.0 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully
effective.

Net Investment Hedging

During the year ended December 30, 2006, we implemented a change in our method of assessing
the amount of effectiveness on all newly transacted net investment hedges to be based on changes in
spot exchange rates. Previously, we assessed the amount of effectiveness using a method based on
changes in forward exchange rates. This change in method essentially converts certain U.S. LIBOR
based borrowings to Euro LIBOR based borrowings, allowing us to better align our interest costs and
the currency-denomination of funding the business with the geography of our business interests.

With regard to all net investment hedging arrangements that existed at the time of this
change, we stopped applying hedge accounting prospectively from the date of change. As a result,
we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.0 million, representing the foreign exchange
component of our mark-to-market adjustment for the period from the date of change through December
30, 2006.

Additionally, as a result of this change, we recognized a reduction in interest expense of
approximately $2.8 million representing the interest rate component of our mark-to-market
adjustment. Given current market conditions, we expect further reductions of interest expense into
the foreseeable future.

Foreign Currency Agreements

The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may affect our
financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our
revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in
U.S. dollars. Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign
currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on earnings. We purchase short-term (i.e., 12 months or less) foreign currency
forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long-term
intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of



merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers. We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency
profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.

As of December 30, 2006, we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with
notional amounts of $478.7 million, of which $420.2 million related to intercompany debt and $58.5
million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign suppliers. The contracts hedge
currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar for Euros ($334.4 million), British Pounds ($34.8
million), Australian Dollars ($22.7 million), Swiss Francs ($1.1 million), Japanese Yen ($168.5
thousand) and Canadian Dollars ($5.3 million). In addition, our international business entered
into hedges against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies. The notional
amount of such contracts was $80.2 million. A hypothetical 5% change of the value of the U.S.
Dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by $20.6 million.

As of December 30, 2006, the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements, which
expire through January 2, 2008, recorded in other current liabilities was $8.7 million, as
determined by quoted market prices. For the year ended December 30, 2006, we had realized net
gains of $1.5 million and unrealized gains of $1.5 million relating to such agreements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of
December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30,
2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Henry Schein, Inc. at December 30, 2006
and December 31, 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

As described in Note 12, in 2006 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” utilizing the modified retrospective
application method. Accordingly, the prior years’ financial statements have been adjusted to
reflect results as if the fair value method of expensing such share-based payments had been applied
for such periods.

We also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Henry Schein, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and
our report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

We distribute healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare
practitioners in the combined North American and European markets, with operations in the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal,
Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel, Australia and New
Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of
our wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are
greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned, are accounted for under the
equity method. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fiscal Year

We report our operations and cash flows on a 52-53 week basis ending on the last Saturday of
December. The year ended December 30, 2006 consisted of 52 weeks, the year ended December 31, 2005
consisted of 53 weeks and the year ended December 25, 2004 consisted of 52 weeks.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and animal health consumable products, as
well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts,
rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon
historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are
recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the
product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and
product returns are reasonably estimable.

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is
completed at the time of delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the
services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly-liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of
funds on deposit of $48.4 million and $47.0 million, primarily related to payments for inventory,
were classified as accounts payable as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005.

Available-for-sale Securities

Our available-for-sale securities consist of highly liquid tax-efficient securities, including
primarily auction-rate securities and variable-rate demand notes which have a high degree of
liquidity and are reflected at fair value. For comparative purposes, we have reclassified $43.8
million from cash and cash equivalents to available-for-sale securities in our consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2005.

We determine cost of investments in available-for-sale securities on a specific identification
basis. Gross realized gains and losses were immaterial in all periods presented. The securities
held on December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 had contractual maturities of up to one year.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects
our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The reserve for accounts receivable
is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. In addition to reviewing
delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including
historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to
time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors
expected to affect collectibility.

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Inventory and Reserves

Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out method. In performing our lower of cost
or market valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the
inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends. From time to time,
we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to
affect the value of inventory.

Direct Shipping and Handling Costs

Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales. Direct handling costs,
which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise
prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general
and administrative expenses. These costs from continuing operations were $42.5 million, $37.9
million and $31.9 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Advertising and Promotional Costs

We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred. Total advertising and
promotional expenses from continuing operations were $18.8 million, $19.8 million and $21.7 million
for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection
with direct marketing, including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the period which is benefited, generally not exceeding one year. As
of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had $4.3 million and $3.5 million of deferred direct
marketing expenses included in other current assets.

Supplier Rebates

Supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are
earned. The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted
inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally
provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser
of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation is computed primarily under the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Years

Buildings and permanent improvements


Machinery and warehouse equipment

5-10

Furniture, fixtures and other

3-10

Computer equipment and software

3-10

Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software. Costs
incurred during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by
outside suppliers for our use and software developed by a supplier for our proprietary use are
capitalized. Costs incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software
development may also be capitalized.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future
tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes
in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
will be recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined
using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in earnings.

Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to manage the impact that interest rate and
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair
values, earnings and cash flows. Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be
effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be designated as a
hedge at the inception of the contract. We do not enter into derivative instruments for
speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments include interest rate swap agreements related to
our long-term fixed rate debt and



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans and certain forecasted
inventory purchase commitments with foreign suppliers.

Our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges. The terms of our
interest rate swap agreements are identical to the senior notes and consequently qualify for an
assumption of no ineffectiveness under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“FAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Both
the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying senior notes are marked-to-market through
earnings at the end of each period; however, since our interest rate swap agreements are deemed
fully effective, these mark-to-market adjustments have no net impact on earnings.

Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans are designated
as either fair value hedges (loans expected to be repaid within the foreseeable future) or net
investment hedges (loans not expected to be repaid within the foreseeable future) and our foreign
currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loan interest payments are designated
as cash flow hedges. Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to forecasted
inventory purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges.

For fair value hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with the transaction gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded in earnings.
For net investment hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative, along with any gain or loss
on the hedged item, is also recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which
the hedged transaction affects earnings.

During the year ended December 30, 2006, we implemented a change in our method of assessing
the amount of effectiveness on all newly transacted net investment hedges to be based on changes in
spot exchange rates. Previously, we assessed the amount of effectiveness using a method based on
changes in forward exchange rates. This change in method essentially converts certain U.S. LIBOR
based borrowings to Euro LIBOR based borrowings allowing us to better align our interest costs and
the currency-denomination of funding the business with the geography of our business interests.

With regard to all net investment hedging arrangements which existed at the date of this
change, we stopped applying hedge accounting prospectively from the date of change. As a result,
we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.0 million, representing the foreign exchange
component of our mark-to-market adjustment for the period from the date of change through December
30, 2006. Additionally, as a result of this change, we recognized a reduction in interest expense
of approximately $2.8 million representing the interest rate component of our mark-to-market
adjustment.

We classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our
consolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related to the hedged item.

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Acquisitions

The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.
Any excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Certain acquisitions provide for contingent consideration, primarily cash, to be paid
in the event certain financial performance targets are satisfied over future periods. We have not
accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions because the outcome of the
contingencies is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual
impairment analyses. Such impairment analyses require a comparison of the fair value to the
carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on
valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is
available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. We regard
our reporting units to be our operating segments (dental, medical (including animal health),
international and technology). Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of
preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. We assess the
potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and on an
interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
be recoverable.

Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results;

•

significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business (e.g. decision to divest a business); or

•

significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that indefinite-lived intangible assets
are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade
names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property. When an impairment
exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.

Cost of Sales

The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product (net of purchase
discounts, supplier chargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges. Costs
related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other
costs of our distribution network are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses along
with other operating costs.

As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks
throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution
companies. Total distribution network costs from continuing operations were $44.3 million, $42.5
million and $41.5 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”
We previously applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of FAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in our consolidated financial statements. We elected to
adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by FAS 123(R), and accordingly,
financial statement amounts for all prior periods presented herein reflect results as if the fair
value method of expensing such share-based payments had been applied from the original effective
date of FAS 123. Such results are consistent with our previously reported pro forma disclosures
required under FAS 123.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded
directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income
and foreign currency translation adjustments, but also includes unrealized gains (losses) on
hedging activity and pension adjustments.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FAS Interpretation No.
48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”).
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial
statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on future changes, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 and
determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position
or results from operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” FAS 157
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies under other previously issued
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any
new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently
evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).”
FAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over or under funded status of a defined benefit
plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in
that funded status, net of tax through comprehensive income, in the year in which the changes
occur. FAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a defined benefit plan as
of the date of its year end statement of financial position. The provisions of FAS 158 are
effective for our year ended December 30, 2006, with the exception of the requirement to measure
the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of our fiscal year end, which is effective for our
fiscal year ending December 27, 2008. During December 2006, we implemented the requirement to
recognize the funded status of our defined benefit plans. Recognizing the funded status of our
defined benefit plans did not have a material impact on our statement of financial position.

Note 2 — Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Our diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to
basic earnings per share, except that it reflects the effect of common shares issuable upon vesting
of restricted stock and upon exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method in periods
in which they have a dilutive effect.

For the year ended December 30, 2006, diluted earnings per share includes the effect of common
shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt. During the period, the debt was
convertible at a premium as a result of the conditions of the debt. As a result, the amount in
excess of the principal is presumed to be settled in common shares and is reflected in our
calculation of diluted earnings per share.

For the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, diluted earnings per share does
not include the effect of common shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt, as the
debt was not convertible at a premium during these periods.

A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share follows:

outstanding during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were excluded from each respective year’s computation of
diluted earnings per share. In each of these years, such options’ exercise prices exceeded the
average market price of our common stock, thereby causing the effect of such options to be
anti-dilutive.

Non-compete agreements represent amounts paid primarily to key employees and prior owners
of acquired businesses in exchange for placing restrictions on their ability to pose a competitive
risk to us. Such amounts are amortized, on a straight-line basis over the respective non-compete
period, which generally commences upon termination of employment or separation from us. The
weighted-average non-compete period for agreements currently being amortized was approximately six
years as of December 30, 2006.

Trademarks, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships were established through
business acquisitions. Certain trademarks and trade names, totaling $25.4 million and $23.5
million as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, are deemed indefinite-lived intangible
assets and are not amortized. The remainder are deemed definite-lived and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately five years as of December 30,
2006. Customer relationships and customer lists are definite-lived intangible assets that are
amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 10 years as of
December 30, 2006.

Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$18.9 million, $15.6 million and $9.7 million. The annual amortization expense expected for the
years 2007 through 2011 is $19.8 million, $17.7 million,
$16.3 million, $15.1 million and $14.1
million.

Note 6 — Business Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions

Acquisitions

On June 30, 2006, we acquired from Darby Group Companies, Inc. (the “Darby Group”) certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately held full-service distributor of dental
merchandise and equipment. During the third quarter of 2006, we acquired from the Darby Group
certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately held full-line distributor serving
the dental lab community nationwide and a privately held provider of medical supplies and
pharmaceutical products, including generic drugs, branded drugs and vaccines to small medical
practices nationwide. This group of acquisitions (the “Darby Acquisitions”) had combined annual
revenues of approximately $219.0 million. We recorded $13.3 million of goodwill related to our
acquisition of the Darby Acquisitions.

On March 31, 2006, we completed the acquisition of NLS Animal Health (“NLS”), a privately
held, full-service animal health distribution business with annual revenues of approximately $110.0
million. We recorded $50.6 million of goodwill related to this acquisition.

In addition to the foregoing acquisitions, we completed other acquisitions during the year
ended December 30, 2006. The operating results of our acquisitions are reflected in our financial
statements from their respective acquisition dates. Such acquisitions were immaterial to our
financial statements individually and in the aggregate.

On January 11, 2005, we acquired the dental products distribution business of Ash Temple
Limited (“Ash Temple”), a privately held full-service dental distributor based in Ontario, Canada
with annual revenues of approximately $100.0 million. We recorded $16.5 million of goodwill
related to this

Note 6 — Business Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions — (Continued)

acquisition. The operating results of Ash Temple are reflected in the accompanying financial
statements since the date of acquisition.

On April 18, 2005, regulatory authorities approved our pending acquisition of our Demedis
Group’s business in Austria, which operates under the Austrodent brand. This approval was
contingent upon our divesting, at closing, a portion of Austrodent’s business, not using the
Austrodent name, as well as other restrictions. Of the total purchase price for the Demedis Group
(discussed below), $13.5 million was attributable to Austrodent, which was paid in 2004 and
recorded as an other current asset. Upon acquiring Austrodent, this amount, less approximately
$2.1 million received in exchange for the divested portion of the business, was reclassified based
on the fair value of the remaining assets and liabilities acquired, with an increase of $8.6 million
to goodwill for the excess purchase price over fair value.

In addition to the Ash Temple and Austrodent acquisitions, we completed other acquisitions in
Australia, New Zealand and the United States, which resulted in the recording of approximately
$11.5 million of goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations during the year ended
December 31, 2005. These acquisitions were immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

On June 18, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of Demedis GmbH (excluding
its Austrian operations discussed above), which is a leading full-service distributor of dental
consumables and equipment in Germany, Austria, and the Benelux countries; and Euro Dental Holding
GmbH, which included KRUGG S.p.A., which we believe is Italy’s leading distributor of dental
consumable products, and DentalMV GmbH (otherwise known as Muller & Weygandt, or “M&W”). We refer
to these entities collectively as the “Demedis Group.”

As part of our agreement with the German regulatory authorities entered into prior to
acquiring the Demedis Group, we agreed to divest M&W shortly after the consummation of the
acquisition, effected through exercising a put option back to the previous owners. On July 16,
2004, this divestiture was completed for approximately $62.2 million, including the assumption of
debt of approximately $34.2 million, resulting in a reduction of the purchase price for the Demedis
Group.

As part of the agreement to divest M&W, we were entitled to receive 50% of the net sale
proceeds in excess of EUR 55.0 million, in the event M&W was subsequently resold before June 18,
2005. On September 24, 2004, an agreement was signed to resell M&W for an amount that resulted in our
realizing a share of the net sale proceeds equal to approximately $32.4 million, which we received
in October 2004. This amount was treated as a further reduction of the purchase price for the
Demedis Group.

In addition to the Demedis Group acquisition, we completed other acquisitions and made
earn-out payments that resulted in recording additional goodwill during 2004. These transactions
were immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

Divestitures

On April 1, 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Hospital Supply Business,
previously reported as part of our healthcare distribution reportable segment. The sale price was
$36.5 million, which was received during the second quarter of 2006. As a result of this sale,
included in the operating results from discontinued operations for 2006 is a $32.3 million ($19.4
million after-tax) loss on the sale, including $3.5 million ($2.1 million after-tax) of
transitional service obligations and selling costs.

Note 6 — Business Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions — (Continued)

Net sales generated by our Hospital Supply Business were $37.9 million for the three months
ended April 1, 2006 and $152.8 million and $161.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
December 25, 2004. We have classified the operating results of the Hospital Supply Business as a
discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods
presented. The carrying amounts of the major classes of the Hospital Supply Business assets
held-for-sale as of December 31, 2005 included accounts receivable, net of reserves, of
approximately $43.9 million and inventories, net of reserves, of approximately $16.2 million.

As part of the sale agreement, we are obligated to make payments to the buyer, up to a maximum
of $13.0 million, contingent upon the buyer’s collection of specified accounts receivable within
one year and the maintenance of a specified level of aggregate sales of the Hospital Supply
Business during the two-year post-closing period. Any payments made in connection with these
contingencies will be presented as part of our results from discontinued operations.

Loan and Investment Agreement

On July 18, 2006, we loaned D4D Technologies, LLC (“D4D”) $7.6 million and agreed to loan an
additional $5.7 million contingent upon the achievement of specified D4D operational milestones.
As of December 30, 2006, we have loaned D4D a total of $10.1 million. If the remaining operational
milestones are achieved, the additional $3.2 million loan is expected to be made during 2007. The
loans are repayable between December 2007 and July 2013.

We also agreed to make two equity investments in D4D totaling $27.7 million contingent upon
the achievement of specified D4D operational milestones. If such operational milestones are
achieved, we expect to make these investments in 2007. We have the option to fund a portion of our
second equity investment in D4D by utilizing the loan amounts due to us from D4D. We expect to
account for such investments under the equity method prospectively from the date of our first
equity investment.

Note 7  —  Debt

Bank Credit Lines

We have a $300.0 million revolving credit facility with a $100.0 million expansion feature.
This facility, which expires in May 2010, replaced our previous revolving credit facility of $200.0
million, which was scheduled to expire in May 2006. The interest rate is based on USD LIBOR plus a
spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter. The agreement
provides, among other things, that we maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage
ratios, and contains restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, employee and
shareholder loans, disposal of businesses and certain changes in ownership. As of December 30,
2006, there were $8.2 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings
outstanding under this revolving credit facility.

As of December 30, 2006, we had various short-term bank credit lines available, of which $2.5
million was outstanding. As of December 30, 2006, such credit lines had a weighted average
interest rate of 4.5%. Our bank credit lines were collateralized by certain assets with an
aggregate net carrying value of $4.9 million at December 30, 2006.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we issued $130.0
million and $100.0 million in senior notes. The $130.0 million notes mature on June 30, 2009 and
bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.9% per annum. Principal payments on the $100.0 million notes of
$20.0 million annually commenced September 25, 2006 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.7% per
annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually.

In 2003, we entered into agreements relating to our $230.0 million senior notes to exchange
their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The value of debt exchanged to a variable
rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes. As of December
30, 2006, there is $210.0 million of principal remaining with a weighted-average interest rate of
8.1%. For the year ended December 30, 2006, the weighted-average variable interest rate was 8.6%.
This weighted-average variable interest rate is comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and resets on the
interest due dates for such senior notes. The interest rate swap agreements are marked-to-market
at each balance sheet date, with an offsetting adjustment to the senior notes.

The agreement governing our senior notes provides, among other things, that we will maintain
on a consolidated basis, certain leverage and priority debt ratios and a minimum net worth. The
agreement also contains restrictions relating to transactions with affiliates, annual dividends,
mergers and acquisitions and liens. The agreements limit the distribution of dividends without the
prior written consent of the lenders (limited to $25.0 million, plus 80% of cumulative net income,
plus net proceeds from the issuance of additional capital stock.) As of December 30, 2006, the
amount of retained earnings free of restrictions was $503.0 million.

Note 7 — Debt — (Continued)

In 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These notes are
senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to mature on
August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, which
commenced on February 15, 2005. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion
ratio of 21.58 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is the equivalent conversion price of
$46.34 per share, under the following circumstances:

•

if the price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion price
measured over a specified number of trading days;

•

during the five business-day period following any 10 consecutive
trading-day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10
trading-day period was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes
during that period;

•

if the notes have been called for redemption; or

•

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified
corporate transactions, as defined in the note agreement.

Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the
principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied
in shares of our common stock. We also will pay contingent interest during any six-month interest
period beginning August 15, 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is above specified
levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August 20, 2010. The note holders may
require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August 15, 2010, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029
or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event.

As of December 30, 2006, the aggregate amounts of long-term debt, including capital leases,
maturing in each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows: 2007 — $41.0 million; 2008
— $21.9 million; 2009 — $146.9 million; 2010 — $20.0 million; 2011 — $0.5 million; 2012 and
thereafter — $266.5 million.

The deferred tax asset is realizable as we have sufficient taxable income in prior years and
anticipate sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the tax benefit for deductible
temporary differences.

As of December 30, 2006, we have domestic unconsolidated net operating loss carryforwards of
$22.9 million, which are available to offset future federal taxable income through 2026. Foreign
net operating losses totaled $223.1 million as of
December 30, 2006. Of such losses, $694
can be utilized against future foreign income through 2012, $703 can be utilized against
future foreign income through 2013 and $221.7 million has an indefinite life.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been, and will continue to be reinvested. These
earnings could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign
earnings were loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate, or if we should sell our stock in the foreign
subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might
be payable on the foreign earnings; however, we believe that foreign tax credits may substantially
offset any U.S. tax liabilities. As of December 30, 2006, the cumulative amount of reinvested
earnings was approximately $55.6 million.

Note 9  —  Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash equivalents and trade receivables

— Due to the short-term maturity of such instruments,
the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Available-for-sale securities

— The fair value of available-for-sale securities is estimated
based on quoted market prices for such securities.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 9 — Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk — (Continued)

Long-term investments and notes receivable

—  There are no quoted market prices available for
investments in unconsolidated affiliates and long-term notes receivable; however, we believe the
carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-term debt

— The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market
prices for our traded debt and on market prices of similar issues for our private debt. The
fair value of our long-term debt as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was estimated at $499.4 million and
$518.9 million.

Derivative instruments

— The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts and interest
rate swap agreements are estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers. Such instruments are
carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value (liability) of our foreign currency forward
contracts as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was
estimated at $(8.7) million and $4.0
million, which approximated contract value. The fair value (liability) of our interest rate swap agreements
was estimated at $(6.7) million and $(7.4) million, representing the estimated amounts we would
have paid to terminate the agreements as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005. These
amounts take into account current interest rates, market expectations for future interest rates
and our current credit worthiness.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. These
financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, trade
receivables, long-term investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments. In all cases, our
maximum exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments.
We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have historically been within
our expectations. We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments
subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable.

With respect to our cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, short-term and long-term
investments and derivative instruments, our credit risk is limited due to our counter-parties being
high-credit quality financial institutions. As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of
credit exposure by utilizing numerous different counter-parties.

With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively
large customer base and its dispersion across different types of healthcare professionals and
geographic areas. No single customer accounted for more than 1.1% of our net sales in 2006.

Our long-term notes receivable represent strategic financing arrangements with certain
industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses. Generally, these
notes are secured by certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other
commercial financial institutions. While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of
non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and
operational performance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 11 — Stockholders’ Equity

On January 31, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a dividend. This stock split became effective on February 28, 2005
and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in the accompanying financial
statements and footnotes.

Effective May 25, 2005, we increased our authorized common shares from 120,000,000 to
240,000,000 in connection with the above stock split.

Common Stock Purchase Rights

On November 30, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the “Rights
Plan”), and declared a dividend under the Rights Plan of one common stock purchase right (a
“Right”) on each outstanding share of our common stock. Until the occurrence of certain events,
each share of common stock that is issued will also have attached to it a Right. The Rights
provide, in substance, that should any person or group acquire 15% or more of our outstanding
common stock after the date of adoption of the Rights Plan, each Right, other than Rights held by
the acquiring person or group, would entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of
common stock for 50% of the then-current market value of the common stock. Unless a 15%
acquisition has occurred, we may redeem the Rights at any time prior to the termination date of the
Rights Plan. This Right to purchase the common stock at a discount will not be triggered by a
person’s or group’s acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer which is for all outstanding shares at a price and on terms that the Board of Directors
determines (prior to acquisition) to be adequate and in the stockholders’ best interests. In
addition, the Right will not be triggered by the positions of existing shareholders.

Certain business combinations involving an acquiring person or its affiliates will trigger an
additional feature of the Rights. Each Right, other than Rights held by the acquiring person or
group, will entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring person at a price equal to 50% of the market value of such shares at the time of
exercise. Initially, the Rights will be attached to, and trade with, the certificates representing
our outstanding shares of common stock and no separate certificates representing the Rights will be
distributed. The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires, or commences a
tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of our common stock.

The Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all, but not less than all, of the then
outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of (a)
any person or group acquiring 15% or more of our common stock or (b) the final expiration date of
November 30, 2008.

Note 12 — Employee Benefit Plans

Stock Option and Awards

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”
We previously applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of FAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in our consolidated financial statements. We elected to
adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by FAS 123(R), and accordingly,
financial statement amounts for the periods presented herein reflect results as if the fair value
method of expensing

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note 12 — Employee Benefit Plans — (Continued)

such share-based payments had been applied from the original effective date of FAS 123. Such
results are consistent with the previously reported pro forma disclosures required under FAS 123.

As part of our adoption of FAS 123(R), we recorded the cumulative share-based compensation
expense, net of taxes, for the period 1995 through 2005, resulting in a reduction of our retained
earnings of $44.2 million and an increase to additional paid-in capital of $46.6 million reflected
in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity as of December 27, 2003.

Our accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect pre-tax share-based compensation
expense of $19.5 million ($12.5 million after-tax), $18.2 million ($11.6 million after-tax) and
$18.0 million ($11.3 million after-tax) for the years ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005
and December 25, 2004. Our basic and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share as
originally reported for the year ended December 31, 2005 were each reduced by $0.13 as a result of
our modified retrospective application of FAS 123(R). Our basic and diluted earnings from
continuing operations per share as originally reported for the year ended December 25, 2004 were
reduced by $0.13 and $0.12 as a result of our modified retrospective application of FAS 123(R).

Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows present our stock-based compensation
expense as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for
all periods presented. Additionally, prior to adopting FAS 123(R), benefits associated with tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense were presented as part of operating cash
flow on our consolidated statements of cash flows. However, FAS 123(R) requires that such excess
tax benefits be presented as a cash inflow from financing activities. In the accompanying
consolidated statements of cash flows, we presented $14.9 million, $10.4 million and $8.4 million
of such excess tax benefits as a cash inflow from financing activities for the years ended December
30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004.

Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to
employees and non-employee directors. We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based
on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the cost as compensation expense on a
straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period. Our
stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in
our consolidated statements of income.

Stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the
terms of our 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and our 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plans”). The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors. Awards under the Plans principally include a combination of
at-the-money stock options and restricted stock (including restricted stock units). As of December
30, 2006, there were 20,159,270 shares authorized and 2,488,513 shares available to be granted
under the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan and 800,000 shares authorized and 333,694 shares available to
be granted under the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a
fixed price. Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to our closing stock price on
the date of grant.

Note 12 — Employee Benefit Plans — (Continued)

These awards, which generally vest 25% per year based on the recipient’s continued service, are
fully vested four years from the grant date and have a contractual term of ten years from the grant
date. Additionally, recipients may not sell any shares that they acquire through exercising their
options until the third anniversary of the date of grant of such options. We estimate the fair
value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Grants of restricted stock are common stock awards granted to recipients with specified
vesting provisions. We issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipient’s continued
service over time (four-year cliff vesting) and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving
specified performance measurements (three-year cliff vesting).

With respect to time-based restricted stock, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant
based on our closing stock price. With respect to performance-based restricted stock, the number
of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per
share performance measured against specified targets over a three-year period. We estimate the
fair value of performance-based restricted stock, based on our closing stock price, assuming that
performance targets will be achieved. Over the performance period, the number of shares of common
stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon our
estimation of achieving such performance targets. The ultimate number of shares delivered to
recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of
the final performance metrics to the specified targets.

Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are unit awards we grant to certain non-U.S. employees that
entitle the recipient to shares of common stock upon vesting after four years for time-based awards
or three years for performance-based awards. The fair value of RSUs is determined on the date of
grant, based on our closing stock price.

We record deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns,
based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction
in which we will receive a deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for
financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax return are
recorded in additional paid-in capital (if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset) or in
earnings (if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid-in capital
exists from previous awards).

Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 30, 2006 was generated through
stock options and restricted stock grants. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 25,
2004, the majority of stock-based compensation expense was generated through stock options. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-based awards granted was $24.46, $13.38 and $11.21
per share during the years ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004. For
the year ended December 30, 2006, the fair value of stock-based awards issued was evenly divided
between stock options and restricted stock (including RSUs).

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards as of December 30, 2006 was
$42.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
two years. There were no significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs as of December 30,
2006.

We have not declared cash dividends on our stock in the past and we do not anticipate
declaring cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The expected stock price volatility is based
on considering implied volatilities from traded call options on our stock and from call options
embedded in our existing convertible debt, historical volatility of our stock, and other factors.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
grant in conjunction with considering the expected life of options. The expected life of options
represents the approximate period of time that granted options are expected to be outstanding and
is based on historical data, including option exercises, forfeitures and cancellations. Estimates
of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by
recipients of stock options, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the
original estimates of fair value made by us.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $54.1 million, $41.1 million and
$32.1 million for the years ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004. The
total cash received as a result of stock option exercises for the years ended December 30, 2006,
December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 was approximately $35.6 million, $29.5 million and $21.4
million. In connection with these exercises, the tax benefits that we realized for the years ended
December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 25,
2004 were $13.4 million, $16.5 million and $14.5
million. We settle employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares.

401(k) Plans

We offer qualified 401(k) plans to substantially all our domestic full-time employees. As
determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans generally do not exceed
100% of the participants’ contributions up to 7% of their base compensation, subject to applicable
legal limits. Matching contributions include both cash and our common stock. Forfeitures
attributable to participants whose employment terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to
reduce our matching contributions.

Assets of the 401(k) and other defined contribution plans are held in self-directed accounts
enabling participants to choose from various investment fund options. Matching contributions to
these plans charged to operations during 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $17.1 million, $13.8
million and $11.8 million.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan to eligible
employees. This plan generally covers officers and certain highly-compensated employees after they
have reached the maximum IRS allowed pre-tax 401(k) contribution limit. Our contributions to this
plan are equal to the 401(k) employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base compensation
for the portion of the year

We have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals
(formerly ID Biomedical Corporation), Novartis AG and the Sanofi-Aventis Group through 2014 which
require us to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price or a formula price in
each respective year. The amounts included in the above table related to these purchase
commitments were determined using current market conditions.

Litigation

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of
business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally
obtain product indemnification from our suppliers.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in
amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate
amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate
protection. In our opinion, all pending matters, including those described below, are covered by
insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

As of December 30, 2006, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we
were able to



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 13  —  Commitments and Contingencies  —  (Continued)

reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not material to
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for determining estimated
losses
considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other external
factors, including probable recoveries from third parties.

Product Liability Claims

As of December 30, 2006, we were a defendant in approximately 44 product liability cases. In
many of these cases, the manufacturers have agreed to defend and indemnify us. The manufacturers
have withheld defense and indemnification in some of these cases pending product identification.
In our opinion, these cases are covered by insurance or will not otherwise have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Employment, Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements

We have definite-lived employment, consulting and non-compete agreements expiring through 2010
that have varying base aggregate annual payments of approximately $4.0 million in 2007, which
decrease periodically to approximately $145 in 2010. We also have lifetime consulting agreements
that provide for current compensation of $408 per year, increasing $25 every fifth year with the

On April 1, 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Hospital Supply
Business for $36.5 million which was previously reported as part of our healthcare
distribution segment. As a result of this sale, included in the operating
results from discontinued operations for the three months ended April 1, 2006 is a $32.3
million ($19.4 million after-tax) loss on the sale including $3.5 million ($2.1 million

In the third quarter of 2005, we reached a decision to divest our Hospital Supply
business, which was a component of our healthcare distribution business. This decision
resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of our long-lived assets of
approximately $7.0 million, net of tax, or $(0.08) per diluted share for fiscal 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 15 — Quarterly Information (Unaudited) — (Continued)

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed
the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline.

Our business has been subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and
operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of
sales of software, equipment and seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and
software products), purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end
promotions. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter,
primarily due to increased sales in the
prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other
factors, including:

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet or exceed market
expectations, our stock price may decline.



ITEM 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December 30, 2006 to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

J.D. Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system enhancements in our United States
dental and medical businesses have been completed during the fourth quarter of 2006 to improve
management reporting and strengthen internal control. One enhancement improves the recording
process for sales, cost of sales, and sales credits (with an approximate 2006 value of $3.1
billion, $2.2 billion and $144.0 million, respectively). A second enhancement consolidates certain
medical field sales divisions with approximate 2006 revenues of $532.0 million. These
enhancements, considered in aggregate with the initiatives described below, relating to acquisition
integrations and system implementations, represent a material change in our internal control over
financial reporting.

Acquisitions,
including NLS Animal Health and Provet Holding AG, with approximate aggregate annual
revenues of $189.0 million, each utilizing separate information and financial accounting systems,
have been included in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, acquisitions, including
the Darby Group, with approximate aggregate annual revenues of $221.0 million, have been integrated
into our existing ERP system in the United States and are covered by our existing system of
internal control over financial reporting. Finally, there have been ongoing implementations of new
ERP systems by other existing business units, specifically our International group, with
approximate aggregate annual revenues of $384.0 million.

All system enhancements, acquisitions, acquisition integrations and new system implementations
involve necessary and appropriate change-management controls that are considered in our annual
assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer,



we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO Framework”).
Based on our evaluation under the
COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 30, 2006.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 30, 2006 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Henry Schein Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also in our opinion, Henry
Schein, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of December 30,
2006 and



December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30,
2006 and our report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
