ITEM 1. Business

General

Henry Schein is the largest distributor of healthcare products and
services primarily to office-based healthcare practitioners in the combined
North American and European markets. We serve more than 425,000 customers
worldwide, including dental practices and laboratories, physician practices,
and veterinary clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We
believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 70 years of
experience distributing healthcare products. We are headquartered in Melville,
New York, employ nearly 8,000 people, and have operations in the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria,
Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand.

We conduct our business through two segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same
customer base. The healthcare distribution segment consists of our dental,
medical (including veterinary) and international groups. The international
group is comprised of our healthcare distribution business units located
primarily in Europe and offers products and services to dental and medical
(including veterinary) customers in their respective geographic regions. The
technology segment consists primarily of our practice management software
business and certain other value-added products and services that are
distributed primarily to healthcare professionals in the United States and
Canada.

Healthcare Distribution Segment

•

Our dental group serves approximately 75% of the estimated
135,000 office-based dental practices in the combined United States and
Canadian dental market. Based upon an estimated $4.4 billion
combined United States and Canadian dental market, our share of this
market was approximately 30% in 2003.

•

Our medical group serves over 45% of the estimated 230,000
office-based physician practices in the United States, as well as
surgical centers and other alternate care settings. We also serve
over 70% of the estimated 24,000 veterinarian clinics in the United
States. Based upon an estimated $7.1 billion combined market, our
share of this market was approximately 16% in 2003.

•

Our international group serves approximately 170,000 practices
in 14 countries outside of North America and is a leading
Pan-European healthcare supplier serving office-based dental,
medical, and veterinary practices. Based upon an estimated $5.7
billion Western European dental, medical and veterinary markets in
which we operate, our share of these markets in 2003 was
approximately 9%.

Technology Segment

•

Our technology group provides software, technology, and other
value-added services to healthcare providers, primarily in the United
States and Canada. Our value-added practice solutions include
practice management software systems for dental practices and for
veterinary clinics. Over 50,000 of our software systems have been
installed through 2003. The technology group offerings also include
financial services and continuing education services.



Through our comprehensive catalogs and other direct sales and marketing
programs, we offer our customers a broad product selection of branded and Henry
Schein private brand products at competitive prices. We support our direct
marketing effort with approximately 875 telesales representatives, who
facilitate order processing and generate sales through direct and frequent
contact with customers, and approximately 1,550 field sales consultants,
including equipment sales specialists. In addition, we continue to expand our
management information systems to more effectively market our products and
services.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable
us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This
infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at
competitive pricing and a shared commitment of our “Team Schein Members”
delivering what we believe is a strong commitment to customer service, enables
us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs, as well as to
provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

Sales and Marketing Strategies

Customers

Through our healthcare distribution and technology businesses, we serve
over 425,000 customers worldwide in the dental and medical markets. No single
customer accounted for more than 1.3% of our net sales in 2003. Our dental
customers include office-based dental practices, dental laboratories,
universities, institutions, government agencies and large group accounts;
medical customers include office-based physician practices, surgical centers,
institutions, hospitals, government agencies, and office-based veterinarians
serving primarily small companion animals.

We believe that our healthcare distribution customers generally order from
two or more suppliers for their healthcare product needs and often use one
supplier as their primary resource. We also believe that our customers
generally place larger orders and order more frequently from their primary
suppliers. We estimate that in 2003 we served as primary supplier to
approximately 15% of our total customer base and believe we have an opportunity
to increase the percentage of our customers regarding us as their primary
supplier. Additionally, we expect to increase sales by increasing our level of
business with those customers for which we serve as a secondary supplier.

Over the past several years, we have expanded our customer base to include
larger purchasing organizations, including dental laboratories, institutions,
government agencies, hospitals and surgery centers. As cost containment
pressures have resulted in increased demand for low-cost products and
value-added services, we have targeted specific groups of practices under
common ownership, institutions, and professional groups. For example, we have
an exclusive direct marketing agreement with an American Medical Association
(“AMA”) sponsored service pursuant to which member practitioners have access to
the service’s lower prices for products. In 2003, the AMA sponsored service
accounted for net sales of approximately $29.5 million. These organizations,
government institutions and agencies, hospitals and other large or collective
purchasers, require low-cost pricing and detailed product and usage information
and reporting. We believe that we are well situated to meet the needs of these
customers, given our broad offerings of low-cost products and our management
information systems capabilities.



Sales and Marketing

Our more than 70 years of healthcare distribution experience has helped to
build the Henry Schein® brand among our customers. Our sales and marketing
efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through
personal visits by field sales representatives and frequent direct marketing
contact, emphasizing our broad product lines, competitive prices and ease of
order placement. The key elements of our approach are:



Our telesales representatives generally participate in training courses
designed to familiarize them with our products, services and systems. In
addition, telesales representatives attend periodic training sessions and
special sales programs and receive incentives, including monthly
commissions.

Customer Service

A principal element of our customer service approach is a customer order
entry process that is convenient, easy and flexible. Customers typically place
orders through one of our experienced telesales representatives. Customers may
place orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (“24/7”) by mail, fax, telephone,
e-mail and using our computerized order entry systems known as ArubA® Windows®,
ArubA® eZ, or ArubA® TouchTone (our 24/7 automated phone service) and the
Internet at www.henryschein.com or www.sullivanschein.com. The information
contained on our websites is not a part of this Form 10-K.

We focus on providing rapid and accurate order fulfillment and high fill
rates. We estimate that approximately 99% of items ordered in the United
States and Canada are shipped without back ordering, and that approximately 99%
of orders in the United States and Canada received before 5:00 p.m. are shipped
on the same day the order is received. In addition, because we seek to service
a customer’s entire order from the distribution center nearest the customer’s
facility, approximately 99% of orders are received within two days of placing
the order. We frequently monitor our customer service through customer
surveys, focus groups and daily statistical reports. We maintain a liberal
return policy to help bolster customer satisfaction.

Consumable Supplies and Equipment

We offer approximately 90,000 SKUs to our customers in North America, of
which approximately 70,000 are offered to our dental customers, approximately
30,000 are offered to our medical customers and approximately 40,000 are
offered to our veterinary customers. We offer approximately 75,000 SKUs to our
customers in Europe. Of our net sales in 2003, 7.3% were from
sales of products offered under the Henry Schein private brand (i.e., products
manufactured by various third parties for distribution by us under the Henry
Schein® brand). We believe that the Henry Schein private brand line of
approximately 8,000 SKUs offered to our customers is one of the most extensive
in the industry. We update our product offerings regularly to meet our
customers’ changing needs.

We offer a variety of repair services for our healthcare customers. Our
ProRepair® Group is made up of repair services that include dental handpieces,
dental, medical and vet small equipment and table top sterilizers. These
programs provide rapid turnaround, manufacturer trained technicians and quality
certifications and warranties. Our proservice team also provides in-office
installation and repair services for large equipment in many North American and
international markets. We had 121 equipment sales and service centers
worldwide at the end of fiscal 2003.



Technology and Other Value-Added Products and Services

We sell practice management software systems to our dental and veterinary
customers. Through 2003, over 44,000 of our Dentrix and Easy Dental® software
systems and over 6,000 of our AVImark® veterinary software systems have been
installed. Our practice management software products provide practitioners
with patient treatment history, billing, accounts receivable analyses and
management, appointment calendars, electronic claims processing and word
processing programs. We provide technical support and conversion services from
other software. In addition, the Dentrix and Easy Dental® software systems
allow customers to connect with our order entry management systems. The
Dentrix system is one of the most comprehensive clinically based dental
practice management software packages in the United States. We believe our
software product offerings enhance our ability to provide our customers with a
wide array of system solutions to help manage their practices. We have an
initiative called the Digital Dental Office or “DDO”. The DDO uses a suite of
technologically advanced products to deliver integrated imaging, clinical and
financial applications to the dentist’s office.

We offer our customers assistance in operating their practices by
providing access to a number of financial services and products at rates that
we believe are generally lower than what they would be able to secure
independently. Our equipment leasing programs, which are administered by
third-party providers, allow us to fulfill a wide variety of practitioner
financing needs. We also provide financing and consulting services for all
phases of the healthcare practice including start-up, expansion or acquisition
and debt consolidation. In 2002, we added our Henry Schein® brand credit card
to our product offerings. Our patient financing program provides our customers
with a method of reducing receivables and improving cash flow by providing
patients access to financing. We do not assume any financial recourse
obligation of our customers or their patients in these programs.

Through an arrangement with one of the nation’s largest bank credit card
processors, we offer electronic bankcard processing. We also offer electronic
insurance claims submission services for faster processing of patient
reimbursements, all through a third-party provider for a transaction fee. We
also offer practice management consulting services in select markets within the
United States.

Infrastructure Strategy

Information Systems

Our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key
functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll,
purchasing, sales and order fulfillment. A key attribute of our management
information systems is the daily operating control reports that allow managers
throughout our organization to share information and monitor daily progress
relating to sales activity, gross profit, credit and returns, inventory levels,
stock balancing, unshipped orders, order fulfillment and other operational
statistics. We continually seek to enhance and upgrade our order processing
information system. In the United States, we have introduced FieldCom, a
dental equipment service and repair technology tool that provides an immediate
and paperless communication link between our service and repair technicians and
us. Additionally, in the United States, we have installed an integrated
information system for our large dental equipment sales and service functions.
Such systems centralize the tracking of customers’ equipment orders as well as
spare parts inventories and repair services.

Distribution

We distribute our products in the United States primarily from our
strategically located distribution centers in Eastern, Central, South Eastern,
South Western and Western United States. Customers in Canada are serviced from
distribution centers located in Eastern and Western Canada. We maintain
appropriate inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt
delivery and complete order fulfillment of



their product needs. These
inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our sophisticated
purchasing and stock status management information systems. Once a customer’s
order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center
nearest the customer’s location and a packing slip for the entire order is
printed for order fulfillment. Our automated freight manifesting and laser bar
code scanning facilitates the speed of the order fulfillment. We currently
ship substantially all of our orders in the United States by United Parcel
Service. Our international distribution centers include locations in the
United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Australia, and New
Zealand.

Purchasing

We believe that effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and
enhancing our position as a low-cost provider of healthcare products. We
frequently evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’ offerings and
prices in order to obtain products at the best possible cost. We believe that
our ability to make high volume purchases has enabled us to obtain favorable
pricing and terms from our suppliers. We obtain the products for our North
American distribution centers from about 2,800 suppliers of name brand
products. In addition, we have established relationships with numerous local
vendors to obtain products for our international distribution centers. In
2003, our top 10 healthcare distribution vendors and our single largest vendor
accounted for approximately 28.7% and 5.8% of our aggregate purchases.

Growth Strategies

Our first growth strategy is to increase sales to our existing customer
base and enhance our position as their primary vendor. In the U.S. dental
market, total consumable sales per practitioner are estimated to be
approximately $25,000, of which our average U.S. dental customer’s sales are
approximately $8,000 (or 32%) of those sales. In the U.S. medical market total
sales per practitioner are estimated to be approximately $12,000 of which our average U.S.
medical customer’s sales are approximately $4,000 (or 33%) of those sales. In
the Western European dental market total sales per practitioner are estimated
to be approximately $20,000, of which our average Western European dental
customer’s sales are approximately $3,000 (or 15%) of those sales.

We also seek to expand our dental equipment sales and services. This
includes selling digital x-ray and intra-oral imaging to existing customers, as
well as providing innovative value-added services to help our customers run
more efficient and profitable practices. These value-added services include
practice management software systems, electronic claims and credit card
processing (we processed approximately 25 million claims during 2003), practice
and patient financing, equipment leasing, and continuing education.

Our second growth strategy is to increase the total number of customers we
serve. We estimate that approximately 55% of U.S. medical practices and
approximately 45% of Western European dental practices are not our customers.
We believe that there is substantial opportunity in the Western European
medical market as well. This strategy includes increasing the number and
productivity of field sales consultants, as well as utilizing our customer
database to focus our marketing efforts.

Our third growth strategy is to increase cross-selling efforts of key
product lines. In the dental business, we have significant cross-selling
opportunities between our dental practice management software users and our
dental distribution customers. In the medical business, we have opportunities
to expand our vaccine, injectables, and other pharmaceuticals sales to medical
distribution customers, as well as cross-selling core products with these key
products. Like dental, the veterinary business provides opportunities for
cross-selling between our veterinary practice management software users and our
veterinary distribution clients.

Finally, we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions.
In recent years, there has been consolidation among healthcare product distributors serving
office-based healthcare practitioners and we believe this trend will continue to
create opportunities for us to expand through acquisitions. In recent years,
we have acquired a number of companies engaged in businesses that are
complementary to ours. Our acquisition strategy includes acquiring targets
that will provide additional sales that will be channeled through our existing
infrastructure, acquiring



access to additional product lines, acquiring
regional distributors with networks of field sales consultants and
expanding internationally. We are currently awaiting regulatory approval
for the acquisition of demedis GmbH (“demedis”), a leading full-service
distributor of dental consumables and equipment in Germany, Austria, and the
Benelux countries, and Euro Dental Holding GmbH (“EDH”), which includes KRUGG
S.p.A., Italy’s leading distributor of dental consumable products and DentalMV
GmbH (otherwise know as Muller & Weygandt), one of Europe’s leading direct
marketing distributors of dental consumable products. These acquisitions will
approximately double the net sales of our international operations (see Note 7
to our consolidated financial statements). Additionally, we have completed 22
acquisitions in the past five years, including 8 in 2003.

Competition

The distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is
highly competitive. Many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are
available to our customers from a number of suppliers. In addition, our
competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market
particular products. Manufacturers could also seek to sell directly to
end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce the role of distributors, like us.

In the United States, we compete with other distributors, as well as
several major manufacturers of dental, medical and veterinary products,
primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and
value-added products and services. In the sale of our dental products, our
principal national competitor is Patterson Dental Company. In addition, we
compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national,
regional and local level. Our principal competitors in the sale of medical
products are PSS World Medical, Inc., the General Medical division of McKesson
Corp., and the Allegiance division of Cardinal Health, Inc., which are national
distributors. In the veterinary market, our two principal national competitors
include The Butler Company and Burns Veterinary Supply, Inc. We also compete
against a number of regional and local medical and veterinary distributors, as
well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and
veterinarians. With regard to our practice management software, we compete
against numerous other firms, including firms such as PracticeWorks, Inc., a
subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company, which primarily targets dental
practices, and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., which serves veterinary practices. We
compete in Canada substantially on the same basis as in the United States.

We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on
the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors,
including demedis GmbH (See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements),
the GACD Group, the Pluradent AG & Co., Planmeca Oy, Omega
Pharma NV and Bilricay, as well as a large number
of dental product distributors and manufacturers in the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.

Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar
reduction in our prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially
adversely affect operating results.

Markets Served

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S.
population is increasingly using healthcare services. Between 1995 and 2000,
the 45-to-65 age group grew by 50%, and this group is expected to double by
2020. In the dental industry, there is predicted to be an attendant rise in
oral healthcare expenditures as this segment of the population increases.
Cosmetic dentistry is another growing aspect of dental practices as new
technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions patients seek. At the
same time, there is an increase in dental insurance coverage.
Approximately 56% of
the U.S. population now has some form of dental coverage, up from 44% in 1994.



We support dental professionals through the 70,000 SKUs we offer, as well
as through important value-added services, including practice management
software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing
education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency and
profitability.

We believe our medical group is the fastest growing distributor among the
major competitors in the physician and alternate care markets. There continues
to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’
offices, a trend that may provide additional opportunity for us. There is also
the continuing use of vaccines, injectables, and other pharmaceuticals in
alternate care settings. We have established a leading position as a vaccine
supplier to the office-based medical practitioner.

Our international group is a leading Pan-European healthcare supplier
servicing office-based dental and medical practices. We are in the process of
attempting to replicate our U.S. infrastructure in Europe. Additionally, we
are expanding our dental full-service model throughout Europe, and expanding
our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist. Through our
“Schein Direct” program, we can provide door to door air package delivery to
practitioners in 125 countries around the world.

Governmental Regulations

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state,
federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the
manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Among the
federal laws applicable to us are the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the
Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and the Controlled Substances Act.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally regulates the
introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling,
marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and
medical devices shipped in interstate commerce.

The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, which amended the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, establishes certain requirements applicable to
the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, including the requirement
that wholesale drug distributors be registered with the Secretary of Health and
Human Services and be licensed by each state in which they conduct business in
accordance with federally established guidelines on storage, handling and
record maintenance.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled
substances, we are required to obtain a registration annually from the Attorney
General in accordance with specified rules and regulations and are subject to
inspection by the Drug Enforcement Administration acting on behalf of the
Attorney General. We are required to maintain licenses and permits for the
distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under the laws of
the states in which we operate. In addition, our dentist and physician
customers are subject to significant governmental regulation. There can be no
assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices
will not have a material adverse impact on our business.

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the foregoing laws
and the regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and
licenses required for the conduct of our business.

Proprietary Rights

We hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein” name and logo, as well
as certain other trademarks. Pursuant to agreements executed in connection
with our reorganization in 1994, both Henry Schein, Inc., and Schein Pharmaceutical,
Inc. (which was acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2000), a company
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of multi-source pharmaceutical
products, are entitled to use the “Schein” name in connection with their
respective businesses, but Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. is not entitled to use
the name “Henry Schein”. We intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest
extent practicable.



Employees

As of December 27, 2003, we had approximately 7,900 full-time employees,
including approximately 875 telesales representatives, 1,550 field sales
consultants, including equipment sales specialists, 1,425 warehouse employees,
350 computer programmers and technicians, 800 management employees and 2,900
office, clerical and administrative employees. Approximately 20 of our
employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that
our relations with our employees are good.

10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or

We are subletting 66,500 square feet of this facility through July

(2)

We lease an additional 108,000 square feet on a short-term basis in
the Indianapolis, IN vicinity.

The properties listed in the table above are our principle properties
primarily used in our healthcare distribution segment. We also lease
distribution, office, showroom and sales space in other locations including the
United States, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain,
Austria, Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

We believe that our properties are generally in good condition, are well
maintained and are generally suitable and adequate to carry on our business.
We have additional operating capacity at the distribution center facilities.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

Our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims
in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a
defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other
healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally obtain product
indemnification from our suppliers for manufactured products.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance,
covering risks and in amounts we consider adequate. In many cases in which we
have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the
manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be no assurance that
the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in
adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements
will provide us with adequate protection. In our opinion, all pending matters,
including those described below, are covered by insurance or will not otherwise
seriously harm our financial condition.

Product Liability Claims

As of December 27, 2003, we were a defendant in approximately 16 product
liability cases. Of these cases, 11 involve claims made by healthcare workers
who claim allergic reaction relating to exposure to latex gloves. In each of
these cases, we acted as a distributor of brand name and/or “Henry Schein”
private brand



latex gloves, which were manufactured by third parties. To date,
discovery in these cases has generally been limited to product identification
issues. The manufacturers in these cases have withheld indemnification of us
pending product identification; however, we have impleaded or filed cross
claims against those manufacturers in each case in which we are a defendant.

As of December 27, 2003, we had accrued our best estimate of potential
losses relating to product liability claims for which we were able to determine
a reasonable estimated loss. This accrued amount was not material to our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for
determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently
enacted laws and regulations and other external factors, including potential
recoveries from third parties.

Texas Class Action

On January 27, 1998, in District Court in Travis County, Texas, we and one
of our subsidiaries were named as defendants in a matter entitled “Shelly E.
Stromboe and Jeanne Taylor, on Behalf of Themselves and all others Similarly
Situated vs. Henry Schein, Inc., Easy Dental Systems, Inc. and Dentisoft,
Inc.”, Case No. 98-00886. The petition alleges, among other things,
negligence, breach of contract, fraud, and violations of certain Texas
commercial statutes involving the sale of certain practice management software
products sold prior to 1998 under the Easy Dental® name.

In October 1999, the trial court, on motion, certified both a Windows®
sub-class and a DOS sub-class to proceed as a class action pursuant to Tex. R.
Civ. P. 42. It is estimated that approximately 5,000 Windows® customers and
approximately 10,000 DOS customers were covered by the class action that was
certified by the trial court. In November of 1999, we filed an interlocutory
appeal of the trial court’s determination to the Texas Court of Appeals on the
issue of whether this case was properly certified as a class action. On
September 14, 2000, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s
certification order. On January 5, 2001, we filed a Petition for Review in the
Texas Supreme Court asking the Court to find that it had “conflicts
jurisdiction” to permit review of the trial court’s certification order. The
Texas Supreme Court heard oral argument on February 6, 2002. On October 31,
2002, the Texas Supreme Court issued an opinion in the case holding that it had
conflicts jurisdiction to review the decision of the Court of Appeals and
the finding that the trial court’s certification of the case as a class action was
improper. The Texas Supreme Court further held that the judgment of the Court
of Appeals, which affirmed the class certification order, must be reversed in
its entirety. Upon reversal of the class certification order, the Texas
Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings
consistent with its opinion.

On January 31, 2003, counsel for the class filed a Motion for Rehearing
with the Texas Supreme Court seeking a reversal of the Supreme Court’s earlier
opinion reversing the class certification order. On May 8, 2003, the Texas
Supreme Court denied the Motion for Rehearing, letting stand its opinion dated
October 31, 2002, which decertified both sub-classes in their entirety. On
August 29, 2003, class counsel filed amended papers seeking certification of an
amended Windows® class and an amended DOS class. The only claim asserted for
class certification by the Windows® class was for the alleged breach of the
implied warranty of merchantability. The only claim asserted for class
certification by the DOS class were claims for alleged violations of the Texas
Unsolicited Goods Statute and the Federal Unordered Merchandise Act.
Defendants filed motions for partial summary judgment as to the claims asserted
on behalf of the Windows® Class and the DOS Class. A hearing on Defendants’
Motions for Partial Summary Judgment and Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Certify
a Class was held on November 18-20, 2003. By Order dated December 10, 2003,
the trial court (1) denied Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on
the Windows® Class claims; (2) granted Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment on the DOS Class claims. By granting summary judgment on the claims
asserted on behalf of the DOS class, the DOS motion for class certification
became moot because certain class claims asserted by the named class
representatives for the DOS class were found to be without merit. By Order
dated January 13, 2004, the trial court denied the amended motion for class
certification filed by the Windows® Class in its entirety. The deadline for
the Windows® Class to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the amended
motion for class certification was February 2, 2004. No



appeal was filed on or
before that date. As a result of the favorable rulings obtained in the trial
court, only certain individual claims asserted on behalf of the named
plaintiffs remain pending in this case.

Purported Class Action in New Jersey

In February 2002, we were served with a summons and complaint in an action
commenced in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County,
entitled “West Morris Pediatrics, P.A. and Avenel-Iselin Medical Group, P.A.
vs. Henry Schein, Inc., doing business as Caligor”, Case No. MRS-L-421-02. The
plaintiffs’ complaint purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class, but there
has been no court determination that the case may proceed as a class action.
Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all physicians, hospitals and other
healthcare providers throughout New Jersey and across the United States. This
complaint, as amended in August 2002, alleges, among other things, breach of
oral contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, unjust enrichment, conversion
and promissory estoppel relating to sales of a vaccine product in the year
2001. We filed an answer in October 2002. Because the plaintiffs have not
specified damages, it is not possible to determine the range of damages or
other relief sought by the plaintiffs. We intend to vigorously defend
ourselves against this claim, as well as all other claims, suits and
complaints.

contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends and other
factors. Our revolving credit agreement, as well as the agreements governing
our Senior Notes, limit the distribution of dividends without the prior written
consent of the lenders.

Except for historical information contained herein, the statements in this
report (including without limitation, statements indicating that we “expect”,
“estimate”, “anticipate”, or “believe” and all other statements concerning
future financial results, product or service offerings or other events that
have not yet occurred) are forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to
the safe harbor provisions of applicable securities legislation and
regulations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown factors,
risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results in future periods to
differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
Those factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the
factors described under “Risk Factors” discussed later in this Form 10-K.

Executive-Level Overview

We are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services
primarily to office-based healthcare practitioners in the combined North
American and European markets with operations in the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Spain,
Ireland, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand.

Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different
products and services to the same customer base. We conduct our business
through two segments: healthcare distribution and technology.

Our healthcare distribution segment, which is comprised of our dental,
medical (including veterinary) and international business groups, distributes
healthcare products (primarily consumable) and services primarily to
office-based healthcare practitioners and professionals in the United States,
Canada and international markets. Products, which are similar for each
business group, are maintained and distributed from strategically located
distribution centers.

Our technology segment consists primarily of our practice management
software business and certain other value-added products and services that are
distributed primarily to healthcare professionals in the United States and
Canada. Most of the technology business, including members of its management,
was acquired as a unit.

Industry Overview

In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost
containment. This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a
broad array of products and services at low prices. This trend has also
accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts
and collective buying groups which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining
products at low prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing
specialized management information support. We believe that the trend towards
cost containment has the potential to favorably impact demand for practice
management systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and
facilitation of practice management.

Our operating results in recent years have been significantly impacted by
strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business, both
domestically and internationally, in part, to address significant changes in
the healthcare industry, including consolidation of healthcare distribution
companies, potential healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in
Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.

Industry Consolidation

The office-based healthcare practitioner industry, in the geographic
markets in which we operate, is highly fragmented and diverse. Encompassing
the dental, medical and veterinary markets, this industry accounted for
revenues of approximately $17 billion in 2003. The industry ranges from sole
practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or
service organizations comprised of between a few and a large number of
practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.

Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to
store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the
distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office-based
healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by frequent,
small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially
complete order fulfillment. The purchasing decision within an office-based
healthcare practice is typically made by the practitioner or an administrative
assistant, and supplies and small



equipment are generally purchased from more
than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

We believe that consolidation within the supply industry serving
office-based healthcare practitioners will continue to result in a number of
distributors, particularly companies with limited financial and marketing
resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide
opportunities for growth. This consolidation may also continue to result in
distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current
product offerings and expand the services they can offer or provide
opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a
provider of products to the healthcare industry. This trend has resulted in
expansion into service areas, which (a) complement our existing operations, and
(b) provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus
strengthen, the acquired businesses.

As previously discussed, we are currently awaiting regulatory approval for
the acquisition of demedis, a leading full-service distributor of dental
consumables and equipment in Germany, Austria, and the Benelux countries, and
EDH, which includes KRUGG S.p.A., Italy’s leading distributor of dental
consumable products and DentalMV GmbH (otherwise know as Muller & Weygandt),
one of Europe’s leading direct marketing distributors of dental consumable
products. These acquisitions will approximately double the net sales of our
international operations (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).
Additionally, we have completed 22 acquisitions in the past five years,
including 8 in 2003.

As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to
capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support
increased sales through our existing infrastructure. In the U.S. dental
market, we estimate that there are currently over 300 smaller distributors
holding approximately 40% of the market. In the U.S. medical market, we
estimate that over 500 smaller distributors hold approximately 60% of the
market, and in the European dental market, we estimate that over 200
competitors hold approximately 80% of the market.

As the healthcare industry continues to change, we continually evaluate
possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek
opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the
healthcare industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if
pursued. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would
incur additional merger and acquisition related costs, and there can be no
assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction
would be successful.

Aging Population and Other Market Influences

The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience
growth due to the aging population, increased healthcare awareness, the
proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments
and expanded third-party insurance coverage. In addition, the physician market
continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing in
hospitals to the alternate site, particularly physician offices, despite
significantly lower pricing of hospital medical products. As the cosmetic
surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are
increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices. The elder
care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the
population of elderly Americans.

The January 2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census estimates that the elderly
population in America will more than double by the year 2040. In 2000, four
million Americans were age 85 years and older, the segment of the population
most in need of long-term care and elder care services. By the year 2040, that
number is projected to more than triple to over 14 million. The population age
65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period.



As a result of these market dynamics, the annual expenditures for
healthcare services continue to increase in the U.S. The Centers for Medicaid
and Medicare Services (CMS), Office of the Actuary published “Health
Spending Projections Through 2013” in 2004, indicating that total national
healthcare spending reached $1.6 trillion in 2002, or 14.9% of the nation’s
gross domestic product. Healthcare spending is projected to reach $3.4
trillion in 2013, an estimated 18.4% of the gross domestic product, the
benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the US.

Governmental Influences

The healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation,
licensure, and operating compliance procedures. National healthcare reform has
been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by Congress.
Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of
the total cost of medical care. During 1997, the Balanced Budget Act passed by
Congress significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home
healthcare providers, affecting spending levels and overall financial viability
of these institutions.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (the
“Medicare Act”) was passed by Congress and enacted by President Bush on
December 8, 2003. The Medicare Act is the largest expansion of the Medicare
program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary
prescription drug benefits effective in 2006 with an interim drug discount
card. The Medicare Act also includes provisions relating to medication
management programs, generic substitution and provider reimbursement. Based
upon current information, we believe the Medicare Act may create additional
volume demand and provide incentives for additional utilization of generic
drugs, both of which have potentially positive implications for our
pharmaceutical distribution business.

Product Integrity

Certain pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and
legislators are in discussions regarding the risks of counterfeit products in
the supply chain and the manufacturers’ concerns regarding the impact of
secondary market distribution on counterfeiting. As a distributor of such
products, we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks
associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and with potential
litigation.

For the year ended December 27, 2003, our net sales increased $528.8
million or 18.7% from the comparable prior year period. Of the increase in
total net sales, $521.2 million or 98.6% resulted from an 18.9% increase in our
healthcare distribution business. Of this increase, $137.5 million resulted
from an 11.2% increase in our dental business, $244.1 million resulted from a
22.3% increase in our medical business and $139.6 million resulted from a 31.9%
increase in our international business. The remaining increase in net sales of
$7.6 million resulted from an 11.3% increase in our technology business.

The $137.5 million or 11.2% increase in dental net sales, consisted of an
increase in dental consumable merchandise of $91.0 million or 9.4% and dental
equipment of $46.5 million or 18.3%. The increase in dental net sales was
primarily due to increased account penetration of existing customers driven by
our Privileges loyalty program and an acquisition. Excluding the effects of
the acquisition and exchange rates, net sales for the dental business increased
$96.3 million or 7.9%. The $244.1 million or 22.3% increase in medical net
sales was primarily due to increased sales to physicians’ office and alternate
care markets. The $139.6 million or 31.9% increase in international net sales
was primarily due to an acquisition, favorable exchange rates and increased
account penetration in France, Spain and Austria, partially offset by a
divestiture. Excluding the effect of exchange rates, the acquisition and
divestiture, net sales for the international market increased $31.6 million or
7.2%.

The increase in technology
net sales of $7.6 million or 11.3% was
primarily due to increased sales of value-added products including software
products and related services, including the impact of our MarketOne marketing initiative.
Under this initiative, certain technology and equipment products were sold directly to end-user
customers beginning with the third quarter of 2002, rather than through resellers, which
resulted in a higher growth rate for the technology business.
 Without this change, the technology business net sales would have increased by 8.0%.

    to the prior year period. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative
    expenses decreased to 20.7% from 21.2% for the comparable prior year period.
    This decrease was primarily due to lower payroll and rent costs in our healthcare
    distribution business as a percentage of sales, realized through leveraging
    our infrastructure.

As a component
    of total selling, general and administrative expenses, selling and shipping
    expenses increased $67.4 million or 18.2% to $437.5 million for the year
    ended December 27, 2003 from $370.1 million for the prior year period.
    The increase was primarily due to expenses directly associated with supporting
    increased sales volume. As a percentage of net sales, selling and shipping
    expenses decreased slightly to 13.0% from 13.1% for the comparable prior year
    period.

As a component
    of total selling, general and administrative expenses, general and administrative
    expenses increased $27.4 million or 12.0% to $256.0 million for the year

decreased to 7.6% from 8.1% for the comparable prior year period primarily for
the reasons stated above.

Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net increased $1.4 million to $7.9 million for the year
ended December 27, 2003 compared to the prior year period. The net increase
was primarily due to decreased interest income primarily due to lower cash and
cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2003.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 27, 2003, our effective tax rate was 37.4%
compared to 37.2% for the prior year period. The difference between our
effective tax rates and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily
relates to state income taxes.

Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operation

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we recognized a $2.0 million
loss, net of tax, on the sale of a discontinued operation (See Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements).

Net Income

Net income
increased $19.5 million or 16.5% to $137.5 million for the year

discontinued operation of $2.0 million are included in 2003 net
income.  A real estate transaction gain of $890 thousand and a restructuring accrual reversal of $734
thousand are included in 2002 net income. The effect that such

For the year ended December 28, 2002, our net sales increased $266.8
million or 10.4% from the comparable prior year period. Of the increase in total net sales,
$256.3 million or 96.1% resulted from a 10.2% increase in our healthcare
distribution business. Of this increase, $105.9 million resulted from a 9.4%
increase in our dental business, $111.4 million resulted from an 11.3% increase
in our medical business and $39.0 million resulted from a 9.8% increase in our
international business. The remaining increase in net sales of $10.5 million
resulted from an 18.7% increase in our technology business.

The $105.9 million or 9.4% increase in dental net sales, consisted of an
increase in dental consumable merchandise of $65.9 million or 7.3% and dental
equipment of $40.0 million or 18.5%. The increase in dental net sales was
primarily due to increased dental equipment sales and increased account
penetration of existing customers driven by our Privileges loyalty program.
The $111.4 million or 11.3% increase in medical net sales was primarily due to
increased sales to physicians’ office and alternate care markets. The $39.0
million or 9.8% increase in international net sales was primarily due to
increased account penetration in France, United Kingdom and Australia and
favorable exchange rates. Excluding the effect of the exchange rates, net
sales for the international market increased $18.7 million or 4.7%.

The
increase in technology net sales of $10.5 million or 18.7% was primarily due to
increased sales of value-added products including software products and related

As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses,
general and administrative expenses increased $11.0 million or 5.1% to $228.5

year period. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses
decreased to 8.1%



from 8.5% for the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primary
due to the elimination of goodwill amortization expense with the adoption of
FAS 142.

Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net decreased by $825 thousand to $6.6 million for the year
ended December 28, 2002 compared to the prior year period. The net decrease
was primarily due to the favorable settlement of a real estate transaction.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 28, 2002, our effective tax rate was 37.2%
compared to 37.0% for the comparable prior year period. The difference between our
effective tax rates and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily
relates to state income taxes.

Net Income

Net income increased $30.6 million
or 35.0% to $118.0 for the year ended
December 28, 2002 compared to the prior year. A real estate transaction gain of
$890 thousand, a restructuring
accrual reversal of $734 thousand, and the effect of the implementation
of FAS 142 at the beginning of 2002 which ceased amortization of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, of approximately $7.3 million are
included in 2002 net income.
The effect that such transactions had on
diluted earnings per share was $0.20 in 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital
needs, acquisitions, repurchases of common stock and capital expenditures
resulting from increased sales and special inventory forward buy-in
opportunities, pursuing growth opportunities and managing funding needs. Since
sales tend to be strong during the fourth quarter and special inventory forward
buy-in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year, our
working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the
third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year.

We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our
operations, revolving credit facilities, private placement loans and stock
issuances. Our principal source of cash is derived from our operations. Our
ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the
continued demand of our customers for our products and services. Given current
operating, economic and industry conditions, we believe that demand for our
products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations
was $128.8 million for the year ended December 27, 2003 compared to $134.7
million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to
increased trade receivable and inventory levels as of December 27, 2003
resulting from increased end of year sales and purchase activity for 2003
compared to 2002.

Net cash used in investing activities was $118.1 million for the year
ended December 27, 2003 compared to $142.8 million for the prior year period.
The decrease was primarily due to an
increase in net proceeds received from the sale and maturity of
marketable securities and a reduction in capital expenditures,
partially offset by an increase in cash used for acquisitions. We expect to
invest approximately between $35 million and $40 million during fiscal year
2004 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities, on computer
infrastructure systems and to integrate operations.



Net cash used in financing activities was $48.4 million for the year ended
December 27, 2003 compared to $18.7 million provided by financing activities
for the comparable prior year period. The net change was primarily due to
payments made to repurchase our common stock and a reduction in the proceeds
received from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options,
partially offset by lower principal payments on long-term debt.

On March 12, 2003, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized
the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock, which
represented approximately 4.5% of shares outstanding on the announcement date.
During the year ended December 27, 2003, we repurchased and retired 1,335,000
shares at an average price of $46.26 per share.

Debt includes bank credit lines and current and non-current portions
of long-term debt, including Senior Notes, notes and loans payable to
banks and capital lease obligations.

Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in
money market funds. These investments have staggered maturity dates, none of
which exceed three months, and have a high degree of liquidity since the
securities are traded in public markets.

Our marketable securities consist of short and long-term debt securities
classified as available for sale, including corporate bonds rated AAA by
Moody’s (or an equivalent rating) and commercial paper rated P-1 by Moody’s (or
an equivalent rating). The fair values of our marketable securities are
determined by quoted market prices.

Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital that is
susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory
purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a
function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities, new
customer build-up requirements and the desired level of investment inventory.
Working capital has increased primarily as a result of our higher sales volume.

Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 46.4 days for
the year ended December 27, 2003 from 48.2 days for the comparable prior year
period primarily due to our continued focus on actively pursuing collection of
aged receivables and tightening credit standards. Our inventory turns improved
to 6.9 turns for the year ended December 27, 2003 from 6.6 turns for the prior
year as a result of increased sales of higher turnover products. We anticipate
future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continued
sales growth.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we
issued $130.0 million and $100.0 million in Senior Notes. The $130.0 million
notes come due on June 30, 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.94% per
annum. Principal payments totaling $20.0 million are due annually starting
September 25, 2006 on the $100.0 million notes and bear interest at a fixed
rate of 6.66% per annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into agreements relating to
the $230.0 million Senior Notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for
variable interest rates. The weighted-average variable interest rate is 4.25%.
This weighted-average variable interest rate is comprised of LIBOR, plus the
spread, and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes.

We have a Revolving Credit Facility of $200.0 million that is a four-year
committed line scheduled to terminate in May 2006. There were no borrowings
under this credit facility as of December 27, 2003. As of December 27, 2003,
certain of our subsidiaries had revolving credit facilities, which had
outstanding balances of $6.1 million, against aggregate borrowing limits of
$32.6 million.

In connection with our pending acquisition of demedis and EDH for
approximately 255 million euros, as previously discussed, after making a
deposit on January 20, 2004 of 35 million euros, we will be paying
approximately 220 million euros at closing. The remaining purchase price will
be paid from existing cash resources and/or the proceeds of (i) a bridge loan
and/or (ii) the issuance or sale in a public or private placement of equity
interests or notes, debentures or other debt securities (or another debt
financing) with a maturity in excess of one year (in any case, a “Permanent
Financing”). We have obtained commitments for a $150.0 million bridge loan
facility scheduled to mature on the six-month anniversary of the closing of the
acquisition. The bridge loan will be unsecured, and will bear interest, at our
option, at LIBOR plus 0.925% or the prime rate. We intend to refinance the
bridge loan by means of a Permanent Financing or, if a Permanent Financing can
be arranged prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, we will pay the
purchase price with the proceeds of such Permanent Financing. The acquisition
is subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is
expected to close mid-year 2004.

Some holders of minority interests in entities we have acquired have the
right at certain times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that
approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price based on earnings of the
entity. Additionally, some prior owners of acquired businesses are eligible to
receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability
targets are met. We have not accrued any liabilities that may arise from these
transactions since the outcome of the contingency is not determinable beyond a
reasonable doubt.



We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12
months. Funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working
capital needs, which, on occasion may change. Consequently, we may change our
funding structure to reflect any new requirements.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments in short and
long-term marketable securities, ability to access public and private debt and
equity markets and availability of funds under our existing credit facilities
will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable
short-term and long-term capital needs.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly influences. Net
sales and operating profits are generally higher in the third and fourth
quarters due to timing of seasonal product sales, software and equipment sales,
year-end promotions and purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare
practitioners and are generally lower in the first quarter primarily due to the
increased purchases in the prior quarter.

Quarterly results also may be materially affected by a variety of other
factors, including the timing of acquisitions and related costs, timing of
sales, special promotional campaigns, fluctuations in exchange rates and
adverse weather conditions.

E-Commerce

Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are impacted
by the advancement of electronic on-line commerce solutions. Our distribution
business is characterized by rapid technological developments and is highly
competitive. The rapid advancement of on-line commerce requires us to provide
continuous improvement in performance, security, features and reliability of
Internet content and technology, particularly in response to competitive
offerings.

Through our proprietary technologically-based suite of products, we offer
customers a variety of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition
of reliable service coupled with our name recognition and large customer base
built on solid customer relationships positions us well to participate in this
growing aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways and
means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, including those
related to sales allowance provisions, as described below, volume purchase
rebates, income taxes, inventory and bad debt reserves and contingencies. We
base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and
market trends, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the
significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial
statements:

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and veterinary
consumable products, as well as dental equipment, software products and
services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to



customers,
customer returns and other adjustments are recorded based upon historical data
and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when
products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume,
low-dollar orders shipped utilizing third-party common carriers. We believe
that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the
completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment
obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the
resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when
products are delivered to customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled
deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some
equipment sales require minimal installation, which is completed at the time of
delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when
products are shipped to customers. Such software is generally installed by
customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its
design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software,
including annual support and/or training, is recognized ratably over the period
in which the services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment
repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue
is recognized or when the services are provided.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing
our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to
reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in
estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types,
credit worthiness, and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our
assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected
to affect collectability.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“FAS”) No.
141, “Business Combinations”, and No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no
longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Such impairment
tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting
units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on
valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable
information is available for using a present value technique, such as estimates
of future cash flows. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim
impairment review include the following:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets
or the strategy for our overall business; and

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has
been impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of
income. Based on our 2003 impairment review process, we have not recorded any
impairments during the year ended December 27, 2003.



Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use
of such assets. Other definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated
useful lives. Such definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of
non-compete agreements and customer relationships. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written
down to fair value. We have not
recorded any impairments during the year ended December 27, 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic
value-based method of accounting prescribed by APB No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees”. Under this method, no compensation expense is
recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted
market price of the stock at the grant date.

We make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if
the fair value-based method of accounting (the alternative method of accounting
for stock-based compensation) had been applied as required by FAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. The fair value-based method
requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk-free interest rates,
stock price volatility, dividend yield and weighted-average option life.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FAS No. 132, “Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” This statement
does not change the measurement or recognition aspects for pensions and other
postretirement benefit plans; however, it does revise employers’ disclosures to
include more information about the plan assets, obligations to pay benefits and
funding obligations. FAS 132, as revised, was effective for our 2003
consolidated financial statements. The adoption of FAS 132 did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”
FAS No. 150 clarifies the definition of a liability as currently defined in
FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, “Elements of Financial Statements,” as well as
other planned revisions. This statement requires a financial instrument that
embodies an obligation of an issuer to be classified as a liability. In
addition, the statement establishes standards for the initial and subsequent
measurement of these financial instruments and disclosure requirements. FAS
150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003. For all instruments entered into or last modified prior to May 31,
2003, FAS 150 was effective at the beginning of our third quarter of 2003. The
adoption of FAS 150 did not have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” FAS No. 149 amends FAS No. 133
for decisions made by the FASB’s Derivatives Implementation Group, other FASB
projects dealing with financial instruments, and in response to implementation
issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative.
This statement is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30,
2003. The adoption of FAS 149 did not have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and in December 2003, a revised
interpretation was issued (FIN No. 46(R)). In general, a variable



interest entity (“VIE”) is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other
legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity
investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide
sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN
46 requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is designated
as the primary beneficiary. Application of FIN 46 is required in financial
statements of public entities that have interest in structures that are
commonly referred to as special-purpose entities, or SPEs, for periods ending
after December 15, 2003. Application by public entities, other than small
business issuers, for all other types of VIEs (i.e. non-SPEs) is required in
financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of
FIN 46 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” This statement amends FAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. We adopted the disclosure provisions of this standard.

In November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus regarding EITF Issue No.
00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” EITF 00-21 addresses
accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The guidance provided
by EITF 00-21 is effective for contracts entered into on or after July 1, 2003.
The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued
 FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. FIN 45 addresses the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees. FIN 45 also
clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements in this Interpretation are
effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on
our financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities”. This Statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”. The principal difference between this
Statement and EITF 94-3 relates to the Statement’s requirements for recognition
of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. This
Statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, whereas under
EITF 94-3, a liability was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to
an exit plan. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 146 did not have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting requirements for
retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. In May
2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, 64,
Amendment to FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April
2002.” FAS 145 amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make
various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their
applicability under changed conditions. FAS 143 and 145 were effective
commencing April 1, 2003 and did not have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks, which include changes in U.S. and
international interest rates, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange
rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other. We attempt to reduce
these risks by utilizing interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency
forward and swap contracts. These hedging activities provide only limited
protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks. Factors that
could impact the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the
interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments.
All interest rate swap and currency contracts that we enter into are components
of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an
existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure, not for
speculation.

Interest Rate Swaps

We
have fixed rate Senior Notes of $130.0 million at 6.94% and $100.0
million at 6.66%. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into interest
rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest
rates payable on the $230.0 million Senior Notes. The variable rate is
comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for
the Senior Notes. As a result of these interest rate swap agreements, as well
as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements, we are exposed
to risk from changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point
increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by
approximately $2.4 million.

As of December 27, 2003, the fair value of our interest rate swap
agreements recorded in other non-current assets was approximately $700
thousand, which represented the amount that would be earned upon unwinding the
interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time. Changes
in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an
adjustment to the related assets with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying
value of the $230.0 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective.

Foreign Exchange

The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may
affect our financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or
negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and retained
earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars. Where we deem it
prudent, we engage in hedging programs, using primarily foreign currency
forward and swap contracts, aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations on earnings. We purchase short-term foreign
currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks
associated with long-term intercompany loans, due from our international
subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors. We
do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars as
we regard this as an accounting not an economic exposure.

As of December 27, 2003, we had outstanding foreign currency forward and
swap contracts aggregating $105.5 million, of which $97.0 million related to
intercompany debt and $8.5 million related to the purchase of merchandise from
foreign vendors. The contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of British
Pounds ($32.9 million), Euros ($61.7 million), Australian Dollars ($9.0
million), Swiss Francs ($1.4 million), Japanese Yen ($355 thousand), Swedish
Krona ($82 thousand) and New Zealand Dollars ($82 thousand). As of December
27, 2003, the fair value of these contracts, calculated as the gross value of
future US dollar payments and receipts determined by quoted market prices was
$114.9 million. These contracts expire through January 2005. For the year
ended December 27, 2003, we recognized a loss relating to our foreign currency
forward and swap contracts of $200 thousand.



Risk Factors

Stockholders and investors should carefully consider the risks described
below and other information in this annual report. Our business, financial
condition and operating results, and the trading price of our common stock
could be adversely affected if any of these risks materialize.

•

The healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive,
and we compete with numerous companies, including major manufacturers
and distributors that have greater financial and other resources than
us. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular
products or manufacturers could increase their efforts to sell directly
to end-users, thereby bypassing distributors like us. Consolidation
among healthcare products distributors could result in existing
competitors increasing their market position. In addition,
unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access
to products or interruptions in supply of products from manufacturers,
could adversely affect our operating results.

•

In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant
change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including the
reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance
programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and corporate health insurance
plans; trends toward managed care; consolidation of healthcare
distribution companies; electronic commerce; and collective purchasing
arrangements among office-based healthcare practitioners. If we are
unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare
industry, our operating results could be adversely affected.

•

Our technology segment, which primarily sells practice management
software and other value-added products, depends upon continued product
development, technical support and marketing. Failures in these and
related areas could adversely affect our results of operations.

•

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state,
federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the
manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices,
including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Prescription
Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and the Controlled Substances Act. There is
no assurance that current or future government regulations will not
adversely affect our business.

•

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in
the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a
defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and
other healthcare products. We have insurance policies, including
product liability insurance, and in many cases we have indemnification
rights from manufacturers with respect to the products we distribute.
There is no assurance that insurance coverage or manufacturers’
indemnity will be available in all of the pending or any future cases
brought against us, or that an unfavorable result in any such case will
not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

•

Our business is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain
qualified sales representatives, service specialists and other sales
agents. Due to the relationships developed between our field sales
representatives and their customers, upon the departure of a sales
representative we face the risk of losing the representative’s
customers, especially if the representative becomes an employee of one
of our competitors.

•

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly influences.
Net sales and operating profits are generally higher in the third and
fourth quarters due to timing of seasonal product sales, software and
equipment sales, year-end promotions and purchasing patterns of
office-based healthcare practitioners and are generally lower in the
first quarter primarily due to the increased purchases in the prior
quarter.



•

Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which
could adversely affect our operating results. These risks include
difficulties in opening and managing foreign offices and distribution
centers; difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies; longer payment cycles
of foreign customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign
jurisdictions; import/export duties and quotas; and unexpected
regulatory, economic and political changes in foreign markets.

•

Our expansion through acquisitions and/or joint ventures could result
in a loss of customers, diversion of management attention and increased
demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources.

•

We rely on third parties to ship products to our customers.
Increases in shipping rates or interruptions of service could adversely
affect our operating results.

•

Changes in e-commerce could affect our business relationships and
could require significant resources. The rapid advancement of on-line
commerce requires us to provide continuous improvement in performance,
security, features and reliability of Internet content and technology,
particularly in response to competitive offerings.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry
Schein, Inc. as of December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2003. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Henry Schein, Inc. at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 27, 2003 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 5, the Company changed its policy of accounting for
goodwill in 2002 as required by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1–Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

We distribute healthcare products and services primarily to office-based
healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets
with operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Spain, Ireland, Portugal,
Australia and New Zealand. We sell products and services to customers in
dental practices and dental laboratories, as well as physician practices,
veterinary clinics, government and other institutions.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry
Schein, Inc. and all of our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are greater than or equal to
20% and less than or equal to 50% owned, are accounted for under the equity
method. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fiscal Year

We report our operations and cash flows on a 52-53 week basis ending on
the last Saturday of December. Each of the three years ended December 27, 2003 consisted of 52 weeks.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and veterinary
consumable products, as well as dental equipment, software products and
services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers,
customer returns and other adjustments are recorded based upon historical data
and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when
products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume,
low-dollar orders shipped utilizing third-party common carriers. We believe
that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the
completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment
obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the
resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when
products are delivered to customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled
deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment
service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation,
which is completed at the time of delivery.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1– Significant Accounting Policies– (Continued)

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when
products are shipped to customers. Such software is generally installed by
customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its
design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software,
including annual support and/or training, is recognized ratably over the period
in which the services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment
repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue
is recognized or when the services are provided.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly-liquid debt instruments and other short-term
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Book overdrafts representing outstanding checks in excess of
funds on deposit, which are primarily related to payments for inventory, were
classified as accounts payable. Such amounts were $0 and $27.0 million at December
27, 2003 and December 28, 2002.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
recorded at fair value. The fair value of substantially all securities is
determined by quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses, net of
related taxes, are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation
allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be
collected. The reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for
doubtful accounts and sales returns. In addition to reviewing delinquent
accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our general
allowance, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit
worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our
assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected
to affect collectability.

Direct Shipping and Handling Costs

Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.
Direct handling costs, which represent primarily direct compensation costs of
employees who pick, pack and otherwise prepare, if necessary, merchandise for
shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative
expenses. These costs were $25.7 million, $23.2 million and $21.2 million for
each of the three years ended December 27, 2003.

Advertising and Promotional Costs

We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as
incurred. Total advertising and promotional expenses were $18.6 million, $13.9
million and $14.3 million for each of the three years ended December 27, 2003.

Inventories

Inventories consist substantially of finished goods and are valued at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO”) method.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1– Significant Accounting Policies– (Continued)

Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line
method over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation is computed
primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives:

Years

Buildings and improvements


Machinery and warehouse equipment

5-10

Furniture, fixtures and other

3-10

Computer equipment and software

3-8

Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop
software. Costs incurred during the application development stage for software
bought and further customized by outside vendors for our use and software
developed by a vendor for our proprietary use have been capitalized. Costs
incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software
development are also capitalized.

Taxes on Income

We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our
financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, we
generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes
in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates will be recognized as income or expense in the period that
includes the enactment date. We file a consolidated United States Federal
income tax return with our 80% or greater owned United States subsidiaries.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and results of operations of our foreign
subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange
rate in effect at each year end. Income statement accounts are translated at
the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to
period are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
account in
stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are included in earnings.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1– Significant Accounting Policies– (Continued)

Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments

We use
    derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in interest
    rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to manage the
    impact that interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
    could have on recognized asset and liability fair values, earnings and cash
    flows. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
    Our derivative instruments include interest rate swap agreements related to
    our long-term fixed rate debt; foreign currency forward and swap contracts
    related to intercompany loans and certain forecasted transactions with foreign
    vendors. We consider our net investments in foreign subsidiaries to be both
    long-term and strategic and consequently do not hedge such investments. Our
    risk management policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be
    effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged
    and be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.

Our interest
    rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedging instruments. The
    terms of the interest rate swap agreements are identical to the Senior Notes
    and consequently qualify for an assumption of no ineffectiveness under the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”)
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”.
    Both the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying Senior Notes are
    marked-to-market through earnings at the end of each period; however, since
    our interest rate swap agreements are deemed fully effective, these mark-to-market
    adjustments have no net impact on earnings.

Our foreign
    currency forward and exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedging
    instruments. These contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet
    and all changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) until the underlying transactions are recognized. Upon recognition,
    such gains or losses are recorded in operations as an adjustment to the carrying
    amounts of the underlying transactions in the period in which these transactions
    are recognized.

Acquisitions

The net
    assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
    date and the consolidated financial statements include their operations from
    that date. Any excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of identifiable
    net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Certain acquisitions provide
    for contingent consideration, primarily cash, to be paid in the event certain
    financial performance targets are satisfied over future periods. We have not
    accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions since the outcome
    of the contingencies are not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with FAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”, and No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill and intangible assets deemed
to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual
impairment tests. Such impairment tests require the comparison of the fair
value and carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a
reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of
sales or earnings, unless supportable information is available for using a
present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. We assess the
potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1– Significant Accounting Policies– (Continued)

Some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim
impairment review include the following:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets
or the strategy for our overall business; and

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has
been impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of
income. Based on our 2003 impairment review process, we have not recorded any
impairments during the year ended December 27, 2003.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived
    assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets,
    are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the
    estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of such assets. Other
    definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
    lives. Such definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete
    agreements and customer relationships. When an impairment exists, the related
    assets are written down to fair value. We have not recorded any impairments
    during the year ended December 27, 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock option awards under the intrinsic value-based method
of accounting prescribed by APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”. Under this method, no compensation expense is recorded provided
the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the
stock at the grant date.

We make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if
the fair value-based method of accounting (the alternative method of accounting
for stock-based compensation) had been applied as required by FAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. The fair value-based method
requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk-free interest rates,
stock price volatility, dividend yield and weighted-average option life.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1– Significant Accounting Policies– (Continued)

Under the accounting provisions of FAS 123, our net income and net income
per common share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated in
the table below. The following assumptions were used in determining the fair
values: weighted-average risk-free interest rates of 3.0%, 4.0% and 4.7% for
the years ended December 27, 2003, December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,
stock price volatility of 45.0%, dividend yield of 0.0% and weighted-average
expected option life of five years for each of the three years ended December
27, 2003.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per common share is computed similarly to basic, except it reflects,
in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under
generally accepted accounting principles, are excluded from net income as these
amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Our
comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income and foreign currency
translation adjustments, but also includes unrealized gains (losses) on hedging
activity and marketable securities and a pension adjustment loss in 2003.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FAS No. 132, “Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” This statement
does not change the measurement or recognition aspects for pensions and other
postretirement benefit plans; however, it does revise employers’ disclosures to
include more information about the plan assets, obligations to pay benefits and
funding obligations. FAS 132, as revised, was effective for our 2003
consolidated financial statements. The adoption of FAS 132 did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1– Significant Accounting Policies– (Continued)

In May 2003,
    the FASB issued FAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
    with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” FAS No. 150
    clarifies the definition of a liability as currently defined in FASB Concepts
    Statement No. 6, “Elements of Financial Statements,” as well
    as other planned revisions. This statement requires a financial instrument
    that embodies an obligation of an issuer to be classified as a liability.
    In addition, the statement establishes standards for the initial and subsequent
    measurement of these financial instruments and disclosure requirements. FAS
    150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after
    May 31, 2003. For all instruments entered into or last modified prior to May 31,
    2003, FAS 150 was effective at the beginning of our third quarter of 2003.
    The adoption of FAS 150 did not have a material effect on our financial position
    or results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” FAS No. 149 amends FAS No. 133
for decisions made by the FASB’s Derivatives Implementation Group, other FASB
projects dealing with financial instruments, and in response to implementation
issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative.
This statement is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30,
2003. The adoption of FAS 149 did not have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and in December 2003, a revised
interpretation was issued (FIN No. 46(R)). In general, a variable interest
entity (“VIE”) is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal
structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors
with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient
financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46 requires
a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is designated as the
primary beneficiary. Application of FIN 46 is required in financial statements
of public entities that have interest in structures that are commonly referred
to as special-purpose entities, or SPEs, for periods ending after December 15,
2003. Application by public entities, other than small business issuers, for
all other types of VIEs (i.e. non-SPEs) is required in financial statements for
periods ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” This statement amends FAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. We adopted the disclosure provisions of this standard.

In November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus regarding EITF Issue No.
00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” EITF 00-21 addresses
accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The guidance provided
by EITF 00-21 is effective for contracts entered into on or after July 1, 2003.
The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In November 2002,
    the FASB issued FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
    Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
    of Others.” FIN 45 addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor
    in its interim and annual



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1– Significant Accounting Policies– (Continued)

financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees. FIN 45
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements in this Interpretation are
effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on
our financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities”. This Statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”. The principal difference between this
Statement and EITF 94-3 relates to the Statement’s requirements for recognition
of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. This
Statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, whereas under
EITF 94-3, a liability was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to
an exit plan. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FAS 146 did not have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting requirements for
retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. In May
2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, 64,
Amendment to FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April
2002.” FAS 145 amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make
various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their
applicability under changed conditions. FAS 143 and 145 were effective
commencing April 1, 2003 and did not have a material effect on our financial

$22.5 million in 2002.

Note 7––Business Acquisitions and Divestiture

On January 8, 2004, we entered into agreements to purchase demedis GmbH
(“demedis”), a leading full-service distributor of dental consumables and
equipment in Germany, Austria, and the Benelux countries, and Euro Dental
Holding GmbH (“EDH”), which includes KRUGG S.p.A., Italy’s leading distributor
of dental consumable products and DentalMV GmbH (otherwise know as Muller &
Weygandt), one of Europe’s leading direct marketing distributors of dental
consumable products. Thirty-five million euros of the purchase price of
approximately 255 million euros was paid on January 20, 2004. The remainder of
the purchase price of approximately 220 million euros is payable in cash and
due at closing.

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we acquired eight healthcare
distribution businesses, which were not considered material on either an individual or aggregate
basis. On May 28, 2003, we acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of Hager Dental GmbH, a dental distributor of consumable supplies
and equipment located in Germany. On June 2, 2003, we acquired the assets of
Colonial Surgical Supply, Inc., a United States dental distributor of
consumable supplies, primarily examination gloves. On November 17, 2003 we
acquired Damer & Cartwright Pharmaceutical, Inc. and American Medical Services,
Inc., specialty pharmaceutical distributors in the United States.

The 2002 reported net sales were over $50.0 million for Hager Dental, over
$40.0 million for Colonial Surgical and over $100.0 million
for Damer & Cartwright
and American Medical Services. The acquisitions were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and have been included in our consolidated
financial statements from their respective acquisition dates.

On August 29, 2003, we sold PMA Bode GmbH, an x-ray film distribution
business located in Germany, which was a component of our healthcare
distribution business segment. PMA Bode generated annual net sales of
approximately $31.0 million. The loss recorded on the sale of PMA Bode was
approximately $2.0 million (net of $54 tax benefit) and is presented separately
as a loss on sale of discontinued operation in our statements of income. Due
to immateriality, we have not reflected the operating results of PMA Bode
separately as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.

Note 7––Business
Acquisitions and Divestiture – (Continued)

During the year ended December 28, 2002, we purchased additional interests
in three consolidated subsidiaries in Europe. These purchases were not
considered material either individually or in the aggregate.

During the year ended December 29, 2001, we completed the acquisition of
two healthcare distribution businesses, which included the purchase of the
remaining 50% interest of an affiliate. Neither of these purchases was
considered material either individually or in the aggregate. The two
transactions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and
have been included in the consolidated financial statements from their
respective acquisition dates.

Note 8––Debt

Bank Credit Lines

We have a Revolving Credit Facility of $200.0 million that is a committed
line scheduled to terminate in May 2006. The interest rate is based on LIBOR,
or prime, as defined in the agreement, which were 1.1% and 4.0% at December 27,
2003. The agreement provides, among other things, that we maintain certain
interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios, and contains restrictions
relating to annual dividends in excess of $25.0 million, guarantees of
subsidiary debt, investments in subsidiaries, mergers and acquisitions, liens,
certain changes in ownership and employee and shareholder loans. There were no
borrowings under this credit facility as of December 27, 2003.

As of December 27, 2003, certain of our subsidiaries had available various
short-term bank credit lines totaling approximately $32.6 million expiring
through October 2004. Borrowings of $6.1 million under these credit lines,
bear interest at rates ranging from 2.8% to 6.5%, and were collateralized by
accounts receivable, inventory and property and equipment with an aggregate net
book value of $73.9 million at December 27, 2003.

In connection with our pending acquisition of demedis and EDH for
approximately 255 million euros, as discussed in Note 7, we will be paying
approximately 220 million euros at closing. The remaining purchase price will
be paid from existing cash resources and/or the proceeds of (i) a bridge loan
and/or (ii) the issuance or sale in a public or private placement of equity
interests or notes, debentures or other debt securities (or another debt
financing) with a maturity in excess of one year (in any case, a “Permanent
Financing”). We have obtained commitments for a $150.0 million bridge loan
facility scheduled to mature on the six-month anniversary of the closing of the
acquisition. The bridge loan will be unsecured, and will bear interest, at our
option, at LIBOR plus 0.925% or the prime rate. We intend to refinance the
bridge loan by means of a Permanent Financing or, if a Permanent Financing can
be arranged prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, we will pay the
purchase price with the proceeds of such Permanent Financing. The acquisition
is subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is
expected to close mid-year 2004.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we
issued $130.0 million and $100.0 million in Senior Notes. The $130.0 million
notes mature on June 30, 2009 and bear interest at a rate of 6.94% per annum.
Principal payments on the $100.0 million notes totaling $20.0 million annually
are due starting September 25, 2006 and bear interest at a rate of 6.66% per
annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually.

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we entered into interest rate
swap agreements relating to our $230.0 million Senior Notes to exchange our
fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The weighted-average
variable interest rate was 4.25% as of December 27, 2003. This variable rate
is comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates of
the Senior Notes.

The agreement governing our Senior Notes provides, among other things,
that we will maintain on a consolidated basis, certain leverage and priority
debt ratios and a minimum net worth. The agreement also contains restrictions
relating to transactions with affiliates, annual dividends, mergers and
acquisitions and liens.

The net deferred tax asset is realizable as we have sufficient taxable
income in prior years to realize the tax benefit for deductible temporary
differences. The non-current deferred tax liability is included in “Other
liabilities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 27, 2003, we have domestic unconsolidated net operating
loss carry forwards of $5.0 million, which are available to offset future
federal taxable income through 2023. Foreign net operating losses totaled
$43.5 million as of December 27, 2003. Such losses can be utilized against
future foreign income and have an indefinite life.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been and will
continue to be reinvested. These earnings could become subject to additional
tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were loaned to us
or a U.S. affiliate, or if we should sell our stock in the foreign
subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax,
if any, that might be payable on the foreign earnings; however, we believe that
foreign tax credits would substantially offset any U.S. tax liabilities. As of
December 27, 2003, the cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was
approximately $9.8 million.

Note 10––Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

Cash equivalents, trade receivables and short-term investments

– Due to
the short-term maturity of such instruments, the carrying amounts are a
reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-term investments and notes receivable

– The fair value of long-term
marketable securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for those
investments. Such instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
For investments in unconsolidated affiliates and notes receivable there are no
quoted market prices available; however, we believe the carrying amounts are a
reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-term debt

– The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based
on the quoted market prices for similar issues. The fair value of our
long-term debt as of December 27, 2003 and December 28,
2002 was estimated at
$250.4 million and $245.2 million.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 10––Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk – (Continued)

Derivative instruments

– The fair value of foreign currency forward
contracts and interest rate swap agreements are estimated by obtaining quotes
from brokers. Such instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet.
The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 27,
2003 and December 28, 2002 were estimated at $114.9 million
and $78.0 million which approximated contract value.
The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 27, 2003
were estimated at $1.6 million. The fair value of interest rate swap
agreements are the estimated amounts we would pay or receive to terminate the
agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates,
market expectations for future interest rates and our current creditworthiness.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of
credit risk. These financial instruments consist primarily of cash
equivalents, trade receivables, short-term investments, long-term
investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments. In all cases, our maximum
exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial
instruments. We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses,
which have historically been within our expectations. We do not require
collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit
risk, except for long-term notes receivable.

With respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments
and derivative instruments, our credit risk is limited due to our
counter-parties being high-credit quality financial institutions. As a risk
management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by utilizing numerous
different counter-parties.

With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited
due to a relatively large customer base and its dispersion across different
types of healthcare professionals and geographic areas. We do have some
concentrations of credit risk associated with our sales to hospitals; however,
such credit risks are somewhat mitigated by our method of monitoring
credit-worthiness and collectability of larger accounts on a
customer-by-customer basis. No single customer accounted for more than 1.3% of
our net sales in 2003.

Our long-term note receivables represent strategic financing arrangements
with certain industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain
businesses. Generally, these notes are secured by
certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is
subordinate to other commercial financial institutions. While we have exposure
to credit loss in the event of non-performance by these counter-parties, we
conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and operational performance.

Note 11––Segment and Geographic Data

Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different
products and services to the same customer base. We conduct our business
through two segments: healthcare distribution and technology.

Our healthcare distribution segment, which is comprised of our dental,
medical (including veterinary) and international business groups, distributes
healthcare products (primarily consumable) and services primarily to
office-based healthcare practitioners and professionals in the United States,
Canada and

international markets. Products, which are similar for each business group,
are maintained and distributed from strategically located distribution centers.

Our technology segment consists primarily of our practice management
software business and certain other value-added products and services that are
distributed primarily to healthcare professionals in the United States and
Canada. Most of the technology business, including members of its management,
was acquired as a unit.

Note 12––Stockholders’ Equity

(a) Common Stock Purchase Rights

On November 30, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan (the “Rights Plan”), and declared a dividend under the Rights Plan of one
common stock purchase right (a “Right”) on each outstanding share of our common
stock. Until the occurrence of certain events, each share of common stock that
is issued will also have attached to it a Right. The Rights provide, in
substance, that should any person or group acquire 15% or more of our
outstanding common stock after the date of adoption of the Rights Plan, each
Right, other than Rights held by the acquiring person or group, would entitle
its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of common stock for 50% of
the then-current market value of the common stock. Unless a 15% acquisition
has occurred, we may redeem the Rights at any time prior to the termination
date of the Rights Plan. This Right to purchase the common stock at a discount
will not be triggered by a person’s or group’s acquisition of 15% or more of
the common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer which is for all
outstanding shares at a price and on terms that the Board of Directors
determines (prior to acquisition) to be adequate and in the stockholders’ best
interests. In addition, the Right will not be triggered by the positions of
existing shareholders.

Certain business combinations involving an acquiring person or its
affiliates will trigger an additional feature of the Rights. Each Right, other
than Rights held by the acquiring person or group, will entitle its holder to
purchase a certain number of shares of common stock of the acquiring person at
a price equal to 50% of the market value of such shares at the time of
exercise. Initially, the Rights will be attached to, and trade with, the
certificates representing our outstanding shares of common stock and no
separate certificates representing the Rights will be distributed. The Rights
will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires, or commences a
tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of our common stock.

The Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all but not less than
all of the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right at
any time prior to the earlier of (a) any person or group acquiring 15% or more
of our common stock or (b) the final expiration date of November 30, 2008.

(b) Stock Options

We established the 1994 Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) for the benefit of
certain employees. As amended in June 2003, pursuant to this plan we may issue
up to approximately 8,579,635 shares of our common stock. The Plan provides
for two classes of options: Class A options and Class B options. A maximum of
237,897 shares of common stock may be covered by Class A options. Both
incentive and non-qualified stock options may be issued under the Plan.

In 1995, Class A options to acquire 237,897 common shares were issued to
certain executive management at an exercise price of $4.21 per share,
substantially all of which became exercisable upon the closing of our initial
public offering which was on November 3, 1995. The exercise price of all Class
B options issued has been equal to the market price on the date of grant, and
accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized. Substantially all Class
B options vest evenly over three years from the date of grant; however shares
exercised in the second and third year after the date of grant may not be sold
until the third anniversary of the date of grant. Class B options expire on
the tenth anniversary of the date of issuance, subject to acceleration upon
termination of employment.

Note
12—Stockholders’ Equity—(Continued)

On May 8, 1996, our stockholders approved the 1996 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan. As amended in June 2003, pursuant to this plan we may grant
options to each director who is not also an officer or employee, for up to
200,000 shares of our common stock. The exercise price and term, not to exceed
10 years, of each option is determined by the plan committee at the time of the
grant. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, 50,000, 40,000 and 12,000 options, were
granted to certain non-employee directors at exercise prices equal to the
market price on the date of grant.

Additionally, in 1997 as a result of our acquisition of Sullivan Dental
Products, Inc. and Micro Bio-Medics, Inc., we assumed their respective stock
option plans (the “Assumed Plans”). Options granted under the Assumed Plans of
1,218,000 and 1,117,000, which are convertible into our common stock, are
exercisable for up to ten years from the date of grant at prices not less than
the fair market value of the respective acquirees’ common stock at the date of
grant.

A summary of the status of our stock option plans, including the Assumed
Plans, is presented below:

(c) Employee Benefit Plans

401(k) Plan

We offer qualified, fully-funded 401(k) plans to substantially all our
domestic full-time employees. As determined by our Board of Directors,
matching contributions to these plans are equal to 100% of the participants’
contributions up to 7% of their base compensation. Matching
contributions include both cash and our common stock. Forfeitures attributable to
participants whose employment terminates prior to becoming fully vested are
used to reduce our matching contributions.

Assets of the 401(k) plans are held in self-directed accounts enabling
participants to choose from various investment fund options. Matching
contributions to these plans charged to operations during 2003, 2002
and 2001 amounted to $7.6 million, $5.3 million and $4.1 million.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan
to eligible employees. This plan generally covers officers and certain
highly-compensated employees after they have reached the maximum IRS allowed
pre-tax 401(k) contribution limit. Our contributions to this plan are equal to
the 401(k) employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base
compensation for the portion of the year in which such employees are not
eligible to make pre-tax contributions to the 401(k) plan. The increases in
plan value that were charged to operations during 2003, 2002 and 2001 amounted
to $839, $707 and $426.

Litigation

Our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims
in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a
defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other
healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally obtain product
indemnification from our suppliers for manufactured products.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance,
covering risks and in amounts we consider adequate. In many cases in which we
have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the
manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be no assurance that
the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in
adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements
will provide us with adequate protection. In our opinion, all pending matters,
including those described below, are covered by insurance or will not otherwise
seriously harm our financial condition.

Note 13––Commitments and Contingencies – (Continued)

Product Liability Claims

As of December 27, 2003, we were a defendant in approximately 16 product
liability cases. Of these cases, 11 involve claims made by healthcare workers
who claim allergic reaction relating to exposure to latex gloves. In each of
these cases, we acted as a distributor of brand name and/or “Henry Schein”
private brand latex gloves, which were manufactured by third parties. To date,
discovery in these cases has generally been limited to product identification
issues. The manufacturers in these cases have withheld indemnification of us
pending product identification; however, we have impleaded or filed cross
claims against those manufacturers in each case in which we are a defendant.

As of December 27, 2003, we had accrued our best estimate of potential
losses relating to product liability claims for which we were able to determine
a reasonable estimated loss. This accrued amount was not material to our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for
determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently
enacted laws and regulations and other external factors, including potential
recoveries from third parties.

Texas Class Action

On January 27, 1998, in District Court in Travis County, Texas, we and one
of our subsidiaries were named as defendants in a matter entitled “Shelly E.
Stromboe and Jeanne Taylor, on Behalf of Themselves and all others Similarly
Situated vs. Henry Schein, Inc., Easy Dental Systems, Inc. and Dentisoft,
Inc.”, Case No. 98-00886. The petition alleges, among other things,
negligence, breach of contract, fraud, and violations of certain Texas
commercial statutes involving the sale of certain practice management software
products sold prior to 1998 under the Easy Dental® name.

In October 1999, the trial court, on motion, certified both a Windows®
sub-class and a DOS sub-class to proceed as a class action pursuant to Tex. R.
Civ. P. 42. It is estimated that approximately 5,000 Windows® customers and
approximately 10,000 DOS customers were covered by the class action that was
certified by the trial court. In November of 1999, we filed an interlocutory
appeal of the trial court’s determination to the Texas Court of Appeals on the
issue of whether this case was properly certified as a class action. On
September 14, 2000, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s
certification order. On January 5, 2001, we filed a Petition for Review in the
Texas Supreme Court asking the Court to find that it had “conflicts
jurisdiction” to permit review of the trial court’s certification order. The
Texas Supreme Court heard oral argument on February 6, 2002. On October 31,
2002, the Texas Supreme Court issued an opinion in the case holding that it had
conflicts jurisdiction to review the decision of the Court of Appeals and
the finding that the trial court’s certification of the case as a class action was
improper. The Texas Supreme Court further held that the judgment of the Court
of Appeals, which affirmed the class certification order, must be reversed in
its entirety. Upon reversal of the class certification order, the Texas
Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings
consistent with its opinion.

On January 31, 2003, counsel for the class filed a Motion for Rehearing
with the Texas Supreme Court seeking a reversal of the Supreme Court’s earlier
opinion reversing the class certification order. On May 8, 2003, the Texas
Supreme Court denied the Motion for Rehearing, letting stand its opinion dated
October 31, 2002, which decertified both sub-classes in their entirety. On
August 29, 2003, class counsel filed amended papers seeking certification of an
amended Windows® class and an amended DOS class. The only claim asserted for
class certification by the Windows® class was for the alleged breach of the
implied warranty of merchantability. The only claim asserted for class
certification by the DOS class

Note 13––Commitments and Contingencies – (Continued)

were claims for alleged violations of the Texas Unsolicited Goods Statute and
the Federal Unordered Merchandise Act. Defendants filed motions for partial
summary judgment as to the claims asserted on behalf of the Windows® Class and
the DOS Class. A hearing on Defendants’ Motions for Partial Summary Judgment
and Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Certify a Class was held on November 18-20,
2003. By Order dated December 10, 2003, the trial court (1) denied Defendants’
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Windows® Class claims; (2) granted
Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the DOS Class claims. By
granting summary judgment on the claims asserted on behalf of the DOS class,
the DOS motion for class certification became moot because certain class claims
asserted by the named class representatives for the DOS class were found to be
without merit. By Order dated January 13, 2004, the trial court denied the
amended motion for class certification filed by the Windows® Class in its
entirety. The deadline for the Windows® Class to file an interlocutory appeal
of the denial of the amended motion for class certification was February 2,
2004. No appeal was filed on or before that date. As a result of the
favorable rulings obtained in the trial court, only certain individual claims
asserted on behalf of the named plaintiffs remain pending in this case.

Purported Class Action in New Jersey

In February 2002, we were served with a summons and complaint in an action
commenced in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County,
entitled “West Morris Pediatrics, P.A. and Avenel-Iselin Medical Group, P.A.
vs. Henry Schein, Inc., doing business as Caligor”, Case No. MRS-L-421-02. The
plaintiffs’ complaint purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class, but there
has been no court determination that the case may proceed as a class action.
Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all physicians, hospitals and other
healthcare providers throughout New Jersey and across the United States. This
complaint, as amended in August 2002, alleges, among other things, breach of
oral contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, unjust enrichment, conversion
and promissory estoppel relating to sales of a vaccine product in the year
2001. We filed an answer in October 2002. Because the plaintiffs have not
specified damages, it is not possible to determine the range of damages or
other relief sought by the plaintiffs. We intend to vigorously defend
ourselves against this claim, as well as all other claims, suits and
complaints.

Employment, Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements

We have employment, consulting and non-compete agreements expiring through
2007, except for a lifetime consulting agreement with a former principal
stockholder, which provides for current compensation of $308 per year,
increasing $25 every fifth year with the next increase in 2007. The agreements
provide for varying base aggregate annual payments of approximately $2.5
million, which decrease periodically to approximately $344. In addition, some
agreements have provisions for incentive and additional compensation.

During the third quarter of 2003, we recognized a
$2.0 million loss, net of tax, from the sale of a
discontinued operation (see Note 7). The effect of this
loss on discontinued operation was $(0.04) on basic and
diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2003.

(2)

In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a $726
pre-tax ($454 after-tax) gain related to a real estate
transaction. This gain was included in the “Other, net”
line on the consolidated statements of income.

(3)

In the third quarter of 2002, we recorded a $1.4
million pre-tax ($890 after-tax) gain related to a real
estate transaction. This gain was included in the “Other,
net” line on the consolidated statements of income. In
addition, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a net
credit of $734 related to a reversal of previously accrued
merger, integration and restructuring costs.

(4)

Diluted earnings per share calculations for each
quarter include the effect of dilutive stock options,
which are added to the quarter’s weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for each period. As a result
of this dilutive adjustment, as well as changes in the
number of common shares outstanding from quarter to
quarter, the sum of the quarters does not equal the full
year diluted earnings per common share amount.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 15––Quarterly Information (Unaudited) – (Continued)

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly influences. Net
sales and operating profits are generally higher in the third and fourth
quarters due to timing of seasonal product sales, software and equipment sales,
year-end promotions and purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare
practitioners and are generally lower in the first quarter primarily due to the
increased purchases in the prior quarter.

Quarterly results also may be materially affected by a variety of other
factors, including the timing of acquisitions and related costs, timing of
sales, special promotional campaigns, fluctuations in exchange rates and
adverse weather conditions.



ITEM 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that all material
information required to be filed in this report has been made known to them in
a timely manner.

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations of the
Effectiveness of Internal Control

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal
control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal
control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.
