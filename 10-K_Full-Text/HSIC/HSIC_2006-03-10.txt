PART I

ITEM 1. Business

General

We believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to
office-based healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. We
serve more than 500,000 customers worldwide, including dental practices and laboratories, physician
practices and veterinary clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We believe that we
have a strong brand identity due to our more than 73 years of experience distributing healthcare
products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ nearly 11,000 people and have operations in
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria,
Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel, Australia and
New Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve
our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad
product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service,
enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also
allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The
healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical (including veterinary)
and international operating segments. Products distributed consist of consumable products, small
equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines,
surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves approximately 80% of the estimated 135,000 office-based dental
practices in the combined United States and Canadian dental market. Based upon an estimated $5.0
billion combined United States and Canadian dental market, we estimate our share of this market was
approximately 38% in 2005.

Our medical group serves approximately 45% of the estimated 250,000 office-based physician
practices, as well as surgical centers and other alternate-care settings throughout the United
States. We also serve over 70% of the estimated 26,000 veterinarian clinics in the United States.
Based upon an estimated $8.0 billion combined market, we estimate our share of this market was
approximately 17% in 2005.

Our international group serves approximately 230,000 practices in 17 countries outside of
North America and is what we believe to be a leading European healthcare supplier serving
office-based practices. Based upon an estimated $8.0 billion Western and Central European combined
dental, medical and veterinary market in which we operate, we estimate our share of this market was
approximately 16% in 2005.

Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to
healthcare providers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice
solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and
veterinary clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing
education services for practitioners.



Industry

The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based healthcare
practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental,
medical and veterinary markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $21 billion in
2005 in the combined North American and Western and Central European markets. The industry ranges
from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service
organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have
combined or otherwise associated their practices.

Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage
large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small
equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by
frequent, small-quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order
fulfillment. The purchasing decisions within an office-based healthcare practice are typically
made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant, and supplies and small equipment are
generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one distributor generally serving as the
primary supplier.

The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging
population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of healthcare technology and testing,
new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage. In addition, the
physician market continues to benefit from procedures and diagnostic testing shifting from
hospitals to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices. As the cosmetic surgery and
elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are increasingly performing more of these
procedures in their offices. The healthcare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth
rate of the population of elderly Americans.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of
distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine
with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth. This consolidation may also
continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current
product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Competition

The distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive.
Many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number
of suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to
market particular products. Manufacturers could also seek to sell directly to end-users, and
thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.

In the United States, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers of
dental, medical and veterinary products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line,
customer service and value-added products and services. In the sale of our dental products, our
principal national competitors are Patterson Companies, Inc. (formerly Patterson Dental Company)
and Benco Dental Supply Company. In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors
that operate on a national, regional and local level. Our principal competitors in the sale of
medical products are PSS World Medical, Inc., the General Medical division of McKesson Corp. and
the Allegiance division of Cardinal Health, Inc., which are national distributors. In the
veterinary market, our principal national competitors are Butler
Animal Health Supply, LLC, MWI Veterinary Supply Inc. and the Webster
Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc. We also
compete against a number of regional and local medical and veterinary distributors, as well as a
number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians. With regard to our
dental practice management software, we compete against numerous firms, including firms such as
PracticeWorks, Inc., a subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company, and Patterson Companies, Inc. In
the veterinary practice



management market, our primary competitor is IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. The electronic medical
records market is very fragmented and therefore we compete against numerous firms.

We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price
and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG &
Co., Planmeca Oy, Omega Pharma NV and Billericay Dental Supply Co.
Ltd., as well as a large number of dental product
distributors and manufacturers in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France,
Austria, Ireland, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain.

Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our
prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results.

Competitive Strengths

We have more than 73 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners
resulting in strong awareness of the “Henry Schein” name. Our competitive strengths include:

Direct sales and marketing expertise

. Our sales and marketing efforts are
designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal
visits by field sales representatives and frequent direct marketing contact,
emphasizing our broad product lines, competitive prices and ease of order
placement. The key elements of our direct sales and marketing efforts are:

•

Field sales consultants

. We have approximately 2,200 field sales
consultants, including equipment sales specialists, covering major
North American and international markets. These consultants
complement our direct marketing and telesales efforts and enable us to
better market, service and support the sale of more sophisticated
products and equipment.

•

Direct marketing

. During 2005, we distributed more than 34 million
pieces of direct marketing material, including catalogs, flyers, order
stuffers and other promotional materials to existing and potential
office-based healthcare customers.

•

Telesales

. We support our direct marketing effort with approximately
1,300 inbound and outbound telesales representatives, who facilitate
order processing and generate new sales through direct and frequent
contact with customers.

Broad product and service offerings at competitive prices

. We offer a broad
range of products and services to our customers, at competitive prices, in the
following categories:

•

Consumable supplies and equipment

. We offer over
70,000 Stock Keeping Units (“SKUs”) to our
customers. Of the SKUs offered, approximately 46,000 are offered to
our dental customers, approximately 34,000 to our medical customers
and approximately 23,000 to our veterinary customers. We offer over
100,000 additional SKUs to our customers in the form of special order
items.

•

Technology and other value-added products and services

. We sell
practice management software systems to our dental, medical and
veterinary customers. Our practice management software products
provide practitioners with patient treatment history, billing,
accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars,
electronic claims processing and word processing programs. As of
December 31, 2005, more than 50,000 of our Dentrix

®

, Easy Dental

®

,
Enterprise, Labnet (dental laboratory), EMR (medical) and our AVImark

®

(veterinary) software systems were installed.



•

Repair services

. We have 163 equipment sales and service centers
worldwide that provide a variety of repair services for our healthcare
customers. Our technicians provide installation and repair services
for dental handpieces; dental, medical and veterinary small equipment;
table top sterilizers; and large equipment.

•

Financial services

. We offer our customers assistance in operating
their practices by providing access to a number of financial services
and products at rates that we believe are generally lower than what
they would be able to secure independently.

Commitment to superior customer service

. We maintain a strong commitment to
providing superior customer service. We frequently monitor our customer
service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical reports. Our
customer service policy primarily focuses on:

•

Exceptional order fulfillment

. Approximately 99% of items ordered in
the United States and Canada are shipped without back ordering and are
shipped on the same business day the order is received.

•

Streamlined ordering process

. Customers may place orders 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week (“24/7”) by mail, fax, telephone,
e-mail, internet and by
using our computerized order entry systems.

Integrated management information systems

. Our information systems generally
allow for centralized management of key functions, including accounts
receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales, and order
fulfillment. These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior
customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and
monitor daily operational statistics.

Cost-Effective
purchasing

. We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to
maintaining and enhancing our position as a low-cost provider of healthcare
products. We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’
offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost.
In 2005, our top 10 healthcare distribution vendors and our single largest
vendor accounted for approximately 25% and 6% of our aggregate purchases.

Efficient distribution

. We distribute our products from our strategically
located distribution centers. We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels
in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order
fulfillment. These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid
of our management information systems. Once an order is entered, it is
electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s
location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order
fulfillment.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to continue to expand as a value-added distributor of healthcare products and
services to office-based healthcare practitioners. To accomplish this, we will apply our
competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:

•

Increase penetration of our existing customer base

. We intend to
increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position
as their primary vendor. In the North American dental market, total
consumable sales per practitioner are estimated to be approximately
$27,000, compared to our average dental customer’s sales of
approximately $10,500 (or 39%). In the U.S. medical market, total
sales per practitioner are estimated to be approximately $11,000,
compared to our average U.S. medical customer’s sales of approximately
$4,400 (or 40%). In the Western and Central European dental market,
total sales per practitioner are estimated to be approximately
$20,000, compared to our average Western and Central European dental
customer’s sales of approximately $6,400 (or 32%).

•

Increase the number of customers we serve

. This strategy includes
increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as
well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts.

•

Leverage our value-added products and services

. We intend to increase
cross-selling efforts for key



product lines. In the dental business,
we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental
practice management software users and our dental distribution
customers. In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand
our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to medical
distribution customers, as well as cross-selling core products with
these key products.

•

Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures

. Our acquisition
strategy includes acquiring entities with businesses complementary to
ours that will provide, among other things, additional sales to be
channeled through our existing distribution infrastructure, access to
additional product lines and networks of field sales consultants and
an opportunity to further expand internationally.

Markets Served

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is
increasingly using healthcare services. Between 2005 and 2015, the 45 and older population is
expected to grow by approximately 19%. Between 2005 and 2025, this age group is expected to grow
by approximately 33%. This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of 9% between
2005 and 2015 and 18% between 2005 and 2025.

In the dental industry, there is predicted to be an attendant rise in oral healthcare
expenditures as this segment of the population increases. Cosmetic dentistry is another growing
aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions patients
seek. At the same time, there is an increase in dental insurance coverage. Approximately 55% of
the U.S. population now has some form of dental coverage, up from 47% in 1995.

We
support our dental professionals through the many Stock Keeping Units we offer, as well as through
important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims
processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a
practitioner’s efficiency.

There continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’
offices, a trend that provides additional opportunities for us. There is also the continuing use
of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings. We believe we have
established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner.

We believe our international group is a leading European healthcare supplier servicing
office-based dental, medical and veterinary practices. We are in the process of replicating our
U.S. infrastructure across Europe. Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model
throughout Europe and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist. Through our
“Schein Direct” program, we have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to
practitioners in over 200 countries around the world.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed
the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of
seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products); purchasing
patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners; and year-end promotions. Net sales and
operating profits generally have been lower
in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters. Quarterly
results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:

•

costs of developing new applications and services;



Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our
stock price may decline.

Governmental Regulations

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and foreign
governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical
devices. Among the federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and the Safe
Medical Devices Act of 1990, as amended, and comparable foreign regulations.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally regulates the introduction, manufacture,
advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, marketing and distribution of, and record
keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce.

The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of
prescription drugs, including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be registered with
the Secretary of Health and Human Services and be licensed by each state in which they conduct
business, and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage, handling and record
maintenance. The Safe Medical Devices Act, which also amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, imposes certain reporting and record-keeping requirements in the event of incidents involving
serious injury, illness or death caused by a medical device distributed by us.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are
required to obtain a registration annually from the Attorney General in accordance with specified
rules and regulations and are subject to inspection by the Drug Enforcement Administration acting
on behalf of the Attorney General. We are required to maintain licenses and permits for the
distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under the laws of the states in which
we operate. Our customers are also subject to significant governmental
regulation.

Certain of our businesses are required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and
comply with operating and security standards of, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration,
United States Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, and
various state boards of



pharmacy,
state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well
as foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and
location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale. These businesses include those that
distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices, or
own pharmacy operations.

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state health care fraud and abuse,
referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Such laws
prohibit, among other things, persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any
remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering or purchasing of items or
services which are paid for by government health care programs. Certain of our businesses also
maintain contracts with the federal government and are subject to certain regulatory requirements
relating to government contractors.

Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state and local laws and
regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, handling and disposal of hazardous
or potentially hazardous substances. In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and
regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel. For example, Florida
and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by
paperwork tracing drugs back to the manufacturers. In addition, United States and international
import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the
importation and exportation of products. Certain of our businesses may also be subject to federal
and state requirements relating to the protection and privacy of health or other personal
information.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations
promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of
our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’
practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business.

Proprietary Rights

We hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein” name and logo, as well as certain other
trademarks. Pursuant to agreements executed in connection with our reorganization in 1994, both
Henry Schein, Inc., and Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. (which was acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. in 2000), a company previously engaged in the manufacture and distribution of multi-source
pharmaceutical products, are entitled to use the “Schein” name in connection with their respective
businesses, but Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. is not entitled to use the name “Henry Schein”. We
intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we employed nearly 11,000 full-time employees, including
approximately 1,300 telesales representatives, 2,200 field sales consultants, including equipment
sales specialists, 1,825 warehouse employees, 425 computer programmers and technicians, 975
management employees and 4,025 office, clerical and administrative employees. Approximately 479 or
4.4% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our
relations with our employees are good.

International Operations from 1984 to 1989 and by Gruenenthal GmbH as Manager of International
Subsidiaries from 1975 to 1984.



ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

The healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to
compete successfully.

We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.
Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow
them to compete more successfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our
customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive
rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers could
also increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and bypass distributors like us.
Industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors, the unavailability of products,
whether due to our inability to gain access to products or interruptions in supply from
manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors could also increase competition. In the future,
we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues.

The healthcare industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and
regulatory influences. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change
driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including the reduction of spending budgets by
government and private insurance programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and corporate health
insurance plans; pressures relating to potential healthcare reform; trends toward managed care;
consolidation of healthcare distribution companies; collective purchasing arrangements among
office-based healthcare practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers. If we are unable to react
effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry, our operating results could be
adversely affected. In addition, the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

We must comply with government regulations governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and
medical devices, and additional regulations could negatively affect our business.

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international
governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical
devices. Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and
the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, as amended. Such laws:

•

regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, handling, record keeping, manufacturing and advertising of drugs and
medical devices;

•

subject us to inspection by the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration;

•

regulate the transportation of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;

•

require registration with the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration;

•

require us to coordinate returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall
procedures; and

•

impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.



Applicable federal and state laws and regulations may also require us to meet various
standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing
practices, product supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy of health
or other personal information, and the importation and exportation of products. Our
business is also subject to requirements of foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our
operations abroad.

The failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws
and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations could negatively affect
our business. There can be no assurance that current or future United States or foreign government
regulations will not adversely affect our business. The costs to us associated with complying with
the various applicable federal and state statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they
may be modified, could be material. Allegations by a state or the federal government that we have
not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. If it is
determined that we have not complied with these laws, or if we enter into settlement agreements to
resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be
subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses or our ability to
participate in federal and state healthcare programs. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse impact on our businesses. We believe that the healthcare services industry will continue
to be subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state, and local levels and that we have
adequate compliance programs and controls to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud, we could suffer
penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and
regulations relating to healthcare fraud. The federal government continues to strengthen its
position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting government healthcare
programs. Our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our
business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, (i) prohibit persons
from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of
a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in
any way paid for by government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of
restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under government
healthcare programs. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with all applicable
laws, many of the regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been
interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or
judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties,
including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare
programs.

Our international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our
operating results.

International operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks that our international
operations are subject to include:

•

difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;

•

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;

•

repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;

•

regulatory requirements;



•

unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;

•

imposition of import/export duties, quotas, sanctions or penalties; and

•

unexpected regulatory, economic and political changes in foreign markets.

As a result of our acquisition of the Demedis Group and other foreign companies, our foreign
operations are significantly larger and, therefore, our exposure to the risks inherent in
international operations has become greater.

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the
expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of
seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing
patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end promotions. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the
prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other
factors, including:

•

costs of developing new applications and services;

•

costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

•

timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•

loss of sales representatives;

•

general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries;

•

timing of the release of functions of our technology-related products and services;

•

establishing or maintaining business relationships;

•

consummating the sale of our Hospital Supply Business;

•

changes in accounting principles; and

•

product availability or recalls by manufacturers.

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our
stock price may decline.

Because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are
dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.

We obtain substantially all of our products from third-party suppliers. Generally, we do not
have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us. Therefore,
suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request. Because we do not
control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by
interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control. In the event that any of
our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in
required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely
basis. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on
a timely basis, if at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products, including the
supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product, would have an



adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the
value of our common stock.

Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.

We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint
ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the
future. Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible adverse effects on our
operating results or the market price of our common stock. Some of our acquisitions and future
acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy
certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations. In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:

•

may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;

•

requires significant management attention; and

•

may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources.

There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.
Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the
following:

•

the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;

•

our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust
regulations; and

•

the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions.

We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use
of the products we sell results in injury.

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time we
are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other
healthcare products. Additionally, we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures
dental implants and we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims
relating to the manufacture of products by that entity. One of the potential risks we face in the
distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the
supply chain. In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered
hazardous materials. The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the
transportation of such materials could subject us to liability. We have insurance policies,
including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.
Additionally, in many cases we are covered by indemnification from the manufacturer of the product.
However, we cannot provide assurance that the coverage maintained by us is sufficient to cover
future claims, that it will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that
indemnification agreements will provide adequate protection for us. A successful claim brought
against us in excess of available insurance or indemnification, or any claim that results in
significant adverse publicity against us, could harm our business.

Our technology segment depends upon continued product development, technical support and successful
marketing.

Competition among companies supplying practice-management software is intense and increasing.
Our future sales of practice-management software will depend on, among other factors:

•

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;

•

our ability to enhance our products; and



•

our ability to provide ongoing technical support.

We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software or
software enhancements, or that such software will be released on time or accepted by the market.
Our software products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when
introduced or as new versions are released. We cannot be sure that future problems with
post-release software errors or bugs will not occur. Any such defective software may result in
increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the
customers using such software. We do not have any patents on our software, and rely upon
copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections. We
cannot assure you that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our
software products.

Our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers,
vendors and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with
qualified sales personnel as well as key customers, vendors and manufacturers. If we fail to
maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such
key persons in the future, our business may suffer.

Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.

Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our
existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
among others. The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our
business. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman. We do not currently have “key man”
life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for senior management is intense, and
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.

Increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our third-party shippers could harm our
business.

Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our
U.S. orders through United Parcel Service, Inc. and other delivery services, and typically bear the
cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse
effect on our operating results. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those
shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver
products on a timely basis.

We may not be able to respond to technological change effectively.

Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by
electronic online commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid
technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of online commerce will
require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to
develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our
clients on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. Our inability to
anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our
business.

We are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates.

In 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed-rate interest
rates for variable interest rates payable on our $230.0 million senior notes. Our fixed interest
rates on the senior notes were 6.94% and 6.66% for the $130.0 million and $100.0 million senior
notes, respectively. The variable rate is comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and resets on the
interest due dates for the senior notes. As a result



of these interest rate swap agreements, as well as our existing variable rate credit lines,
and loan agreements, we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates.

Our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.

We are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired, including the Demedis Group,
and assimilating the operations, services, products and personnel of each company with our
management policies, procedures and strategies. We cannot be sure that we will achieve the
benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur
unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions. To effectively
manage our expected future growth, we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these
companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, accounts receivable
and management, financial and operational controls. If we fail in any of these areas, our business
could be adversely affected.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a
significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:

•

the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;

•

changes in our industry and competitors;

•

our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;

•

any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in
connection with business acquisitions, restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;

•

the dilutive impact of convertible debt on our earnings per share;

•

general market and economic conditions; and

•

any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas we do
business.

In addition, the Nasdaq National Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations
that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on
Nasdaq. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common
stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in
the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been
instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial
costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which would harm our business.

Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may
discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders
receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.

The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for
a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids, and may limit the price that certain
investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions,
among other things:

•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a
merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and



•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to:

•

remove a director; and

•

to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.

In addition, our 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan
and 2001 Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon
a change in control, and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for
increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two
years after a change in control.

We also have a stockholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire us if our Board of Directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate
and in the stockholders’ best interest.

Tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect the Company’s net earnings and tax
liabilities.

We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and
local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative
initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no
assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In
addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.
Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable
laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not
be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

We have no unresolved comments from the staff of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2005 fiscal year.

This facility relates to our Hospital Supply Business, which was classified as a discontinued
operation in 2005.

The properties listed in the table above are our principal properties primarily used by
our healthcare distribution segment. In addition, we lease numerous other distribution, office,
showroom, manufacturing and sales space in locations including the United States, Canada, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic,
Israel, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. We also are
planning to build and occupy a new distribution center in France in 2006.

We believe that our properties are in good condition, are well maintained and are suitable and
adequate to carry on our business. We have additional operating capacity at certain distribution
center facilities.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

Our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary
course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally
obtain product indemnification from our suppliers.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in
amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate
amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate
protection. In our opinion, all pending matters, including those described below, are covered by
insurance or will not otherwise seriously harm our financial condition.

As of December 31, 2005, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we
were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not
material to our financial position, results of



operations or cash flows. Our method for
determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and
regulations and other external factors, including probable recoveries from third parties.

Product Liability Claims

As of December 31, 2005, we were a defendant in approximately 42 product liability cases. We
have obtained defense and indemnification commitments from the manufacturer in many of these cases.
The manufacturer has withheld indemnification commitments in some of these cases pending product
identification. In our opinion, these cases are covered by insurance or will not otherwise seriously harm our financial condition.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005.



PART II

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer

On January 31, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a dividend. This stock split became effective on February 28, 2005
and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in this Form 10-K.

Our common stock is quoted through the National Market tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market
(“NASDAQ”) under the symbol HSIC. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

Our current share repurchase program, announced on June 21, 2004, previously allowed us to
repurchase up to $100.0 million in shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5%
of shares outstanding at the commencement of the program. On October 31, 2005, our board
authorized an additional $100.0 million of shares in our common stock to be repurchased under this
program. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased $88.5 million or 2,518,110 shares under this
initiative, with $111.5 million remaining.

Dividend Policy

We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock during fiscal years 2005 or 2004.
We currently do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future. We intend to retain earnings to finance the expansion of our business and for general
corporate purposes, including our stock repurchase program. Any declaration of dividends will be
at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition,
capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of
dividends and other factors. The agreements governing our Senior Notes limit the distribution of
dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders (limited to $25.0 million, plus 80% of
cumulative net income, plus net proceeds from the issuance of additional capital stock.) As of
December 31, 2005, the amount of retained earnings free of restrictions was $412.3 million.

During 2004, we recorded a $13.2 million pre-tax ($8.4 million post-tax) charge related to
the Fluvirin

contract with Chiron Corporation. This charge, which represented the write-off
of a deferred expense associated with the 2005/2006 influenza season, occurred as a result of
the significant uncertainty about whether Chiron would be able to provide Fluvirin

for the
2005/2006 influenza season. The effect that this charge had on earnings per share for the
year ended December 25, 2004 was $(0.10).

In the third quarter of 2005, we reached a decision to divest our Hospital Supply business,
which is a component of our healthcare distribution business. This decision resulted in the
recording of an impairment charge of our long-lived assets of approximately $7.0 million, net
of tax, or $(0.08) per diluted share for fiscal 2005.

In the third quarter of 2003, we sold PMA Bode GmbH, an x-ray film distribution business located
in Germany, which was a component of our healthcare distribution business. This sale resulted
in a loss of $2.0 million, net of tax, or $(0.02) per diluted share. Due to immateriality, we
have not reflected the operating results, other than the loss on sale, of PMA Bode separately as
a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented. This was partially offset by the
Hospital discontinued operation discussed above.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

In accordance with the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, we provide the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors which, among
others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements,
expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. All forward-looking statements made by
us are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. These
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. These statements are identified by the use of such terms as “may,”
“could,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate” or
other comparable terms.

Risk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
current and historical results include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; changes in the
healthcare industry; changes in government regulations that affect us; financial risks associated
with our international operations; fluctuations in quarterly earnings; our dependence on third
parties for the manufacture and supply of our products; transitional challenges associated with
acquisitions; regulatory and litigation risks; the dependence on our continued product development,
technical support and successful marketing in the technology segment; our dependence upon sales
personnel and key customers; our dependence on our senior management; possible increases in the
cost of shipping our products or other service trouble with our third-party shippers; risks from
rapid technological change; risks from potential increases in variable interest rates; financial
risks associated with acquisitions; possible volatility of the market price of our common stock;
certain provisions in our governing documents that may discourage third-party acquisitions of us;
and changes in tax legislation that affect us. The order in which these factors appear should not
be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.

We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond
our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied
upon as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no duty and have no obligation to update
forward-looking statements.

Recent Developments

During the third quarter ended September 24, 2005, we reached a decision to divest our
hospital supply business (“Hospital Supply Business”) which is a component of our healthcare
distribution business. The primary reason for this decision was that the Hospital Supply Business
does not focus on our core customer, namely the office-based practitioner, and therefore provides
little or no synergies with our core operations.

We have classified the operating results of the Hospital Supply Business as a discontinued
operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. In
connection with this divestiture, we assessed our long-lived assets for impairment, which resulted
in us recording in the third quarter an impairment charge of $11.9 million ($7.0 million after-tax)
for the full write-down of all long-lived assets, including goodwill of $4.6 million.

On March 6, 2006, we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our
Hospital Supply Business, as well as our extended care business the results of which are not
material. The purchase price is $40.0 million, with $29.5 million due at closing and $10.5 million
due 90 days after closing, subject to certain post-closing contingent payments by us described below. The
closing is conditioned upon the buyer obtaining financing and our entering into a transition
services agreement with the buyer, as well as other customary closing conditions. Based on this
sale agreement, we expect to record a loss on disposal, net



of tax, of between $21.0 million and
$24.0 million or $0.24 and $0.27 per diluted share, at the time of closing, which will be presented
as part of the results from discontinued operations.

We agreed to make payments to the buyer, up to a maximum of $13.0 million,
contingent upon the collection of specified accounts receivable within one year and contingent upon
the maintenance of a specified level of aggregate sales of the Hospital Supply Business during the
two-year post-closing period. Any payments made in connection with
these contingencies will be presented as part of the results from
discontinued operations.

Executive Level Overview

We believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to
office-based healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. We
serve more than 500,000 customers worldwide, including dental practices and laboratories, physician
practices and veterinary clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We believe that we
have a strong brand identity due to our more than 73 years of experience distributing healthcare
products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ nearly 11,000 people and have operations in
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria,
Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel, Australia and
New Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve
our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad
product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service,
enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also
allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The
healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical (including veterinary)
and international operating segments. Products distributed consist of consumable products, small
equipment, laboratory products, large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals,
vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves office-based dental practices, schools and other institutions in the
combined United States and Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office-based physician
practices, surgical centers, other alternate-care settings, veterinarian clinics and other
institutions throughout the United States. Our international group serves 17 countries outside of
North America and is what we believe to be a leading European healthcare supplier serving
office-based practices.

Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to
healthcare providers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice
solutions include practice-management software systems for dental and medical practices and
veterinary clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services
for practitioners.

Industry Overview

In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment. This
trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low
prices. It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts
and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at
competitive prices, tend to favor distributors



capable of providing specialized management
information support. We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to
favorably affect demand for practice-management systems and software that can enhance the
efficiency and facilitation of practice management.

Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and
transactions we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to
address significant changes in the healthcare industry, including consolidation of healthcare
distribution companies, potential healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare
and collective purchasing arrangements.

Industry Consolidation

The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based healthcare
practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental,
medical and veterinary markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $21 billion in
2005 in the combined North American and Western and Central European markets. The industry ranges
from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service
organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have
combined or otherwise associated their practices.

Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage
large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small
equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent,
small-quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.
The purchasing decisions within an office-based healthcare practice are typically made by the
practitioner or an administrative assistant, and supplies and small equipment are generally
purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of
distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine
with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation may also continue
to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and
service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products
and services to the healthcare industry. This trend has resulted in expansion into service areas
that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with,
and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.

As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this
trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing
infrastructure. In the U.S. dental market, we estimate that there are currently more than 300
smaller distributors holding approximately 35% of the market. In the U.S. medical market, we
estimate that more than 500 smaller distributors hold approximately
50% of the market, and in the European dental market, we
estimate that more than 200 competitors hold approximately 80% of the market.

As the healthcare industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates
for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a
provider of products and services to the healthcare industry. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if
pursued. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur additional
merger and acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts
associated with any such transaction would be successful.

Aging Population and Other Market Influences

The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging
population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing,
new pharmacology



treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage. In addition, the
physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing shifting
from hospitals to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices. As the cosmetic surgery
and elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are increasingly performing more of
these procedures in their offices. The healthcare market continues to benefit from the increasing
growth rate of the population of elderly Americans.

The January 2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census estimates that the elderly population in the United
States will more than double by the year 2040. In 2000, four million Americans were aged 85 or
older, the segment of the population most in need of healthcare services. By
the year 2040, that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million. The
population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period.

As a result of these market dynamics, the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue
to increase in the United States. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published
“National Health Care Expenditures Projections: 2005 – 2015” indicating that total national
healthcare spending reached $1.9 trillion in 2004, or 16.0% of the nation’s gross domestic product.
Healthcare spending is projected to reach $4.0 trillion in 2015, an estimated 20.0% of the
nation’s gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services
in the United States.

Governmental Influences

The healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation, licensure and operating
compliance procedures. National healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative
initiatives by Congress. Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large
portion of the total cost of medical care. The Balanced Budget Act passed by Congress in 1997
significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers,
affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (the “Medicare Act”) is the
largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception, and provides participants with
voluntary prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card. The Medicare Act also
includes provisions relating to medication management programs, generic substitution and provider
reimbursement. Based upon current information, we believe the Medicare Act may create additional
volume demand and provide incentives for additional use of generic drugs, both of which have
potentially positive implications for our pharmaceutical distribution business.

Product Integrity

Certain pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers are in discussions with
legislators about the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and manufacturers’ concerns
about the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting. As a distributor of such
products, we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with
counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation.

The $737.4 million, or 18.9%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005
includes increases of 18.8% local currency growth (8.4% internally generated primarily due to
volume growth and 10.4% from acquisitions) and 0.1% related to foreign currency exchange.

The $294.2 million, or 18.4%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 31,
2005 includes increases of 17.9% local currency growth (11.3% internally generated primarily due to
increased volume and 6.6% from acquisitions) and 0.5% related to foreign currency exchange. The
17.9% local currency growth was due to dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 15.5% (9.2%
internal growth and 6.3% from acquisitions) and dental equipment and service sales growth of 25.7%
(18.2% internal growth and 7.5% from acquisitions).

The $109.8 million, or 8.6%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 31,
2005 includes increases of 8.6% local currency growth (7.6% internally generated, of which 4.1% was
due to the absence of Fluvirin

®

influenza vaccine in 2004 as previously discussed, and 1.0% from
acquisitions).

The $328.7 million, or 35.4%, increase in international net sales for the year ended December
31, 2005 includes increases of 35.7% in local currencies (30.9% from acquisitions, primarily of the
Demedis Group, and 4.8% internally generated), offset by a 0.3% decline due to foreign currency
exchange.

The $4.7 million, or 5.6%, increase in technology net sales for the year ended December 31,
2005 includes increases of 5.4% in local currency growth and 0.2% due to foreign currency exchange.
The increase was driven by growth in electronic service, financial services and

Gross profit increased $262.5 million, or 24.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the prior year period. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs
associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not
necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies. Additionally, we realize substantially
higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution
segment. These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software
products combined with the nature of the software industry, in which developers realize higher
gross margins to recover investments in research and development.

Healthcare distribution gross profit increased $257.3 million, or 25.9%, for the year ended
December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year period. Healthcare distribution gross profit margin
increased to 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 26.0% for the comparable prior year
period, primarily due to the absence of Fluvirin

®

influenza vaccine in 2004 as previously
discussed. These increases reflect a focus on



margin improvement, including the shedding of
certain lower margin pharmaceutical products by our medical business.

Technology gross profit increased $5.2 million, or 8.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the prior year period. Technology gross profit margin increased to 76.0% for the year
ended December 31, 2005 from 74.1% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a change
in sales mix reflecting a larger percentage of higher margin electronic and financial services
sales and other cost improvements, largely in support.

increased to 8.4% from 8.2% for the comparable prior year period primarily due to payroll and other expenses related to
recent acquisitions, partially offset by the absence of the 2004 $13.2 million charge related to
Fluvirin

Other expense, net increased $5.4 million to $16.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2005 from the comparable prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased
interest expense related to the costs of financing acquisitions along with increased interest
rates, partially offset by an increase in interest income.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2005, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was
36.7% compared to 37.0% for the prior year period. The difference between our effective tax rates
and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a $11.1 million loss, net of tax,
related to discontinued operations (refer to Note 6 in the accompanying financial statements for
further discussion).

Net Income

Net income increased $23.1 million, or 18.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
the prior year period. In 2005, net income includes an impairment charge related to long-lived
assets of discontinued operations of $7.0 million, net of tax. In 2004, net income includes a
charge of $8.4 million, net of tax, related to Chiron Fluvirin

The $704.5 million, or 22.1%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 25, 2004
includes increases of 19.9% local currency growth (7.9% internally generated primarily due to
volume growth and 12.0% from acquisitions) and 2.2% related to foreign currency exchange.



The $237.6 million, or 17.4%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 25,
2004 includes increases of 16.9% local currency growth (14.1% internally generated primarily due to
volume growth and 2.8% from acquisitions) and 0.5% related to foreign currency exchange. The 16.9%
local currency growth was due to dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 16.0% (13.6%
internal growth, of which 6.3% related to sales of the Colgate and Pentron product lines and 2.4%
from acquisitions) and dental equipment and service sales growth of 20.1% (16.6% internal growth
and 3.5% from acquisitions). We expect that the Colgate and Pentron product lines, introduced
through distribution agreements executed in 2004, will continue to contribute to our overall
increase in dental net sales.

The $106.0 million, or 9.0%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 25,
2004 includes increases of 1.0% internally generated and 8.0% from acquisitions (accounting for an
increase of $96.8 million). Additionally, medical sales were affected by the absence of Fluvirin

®

influenza vaccines in 2004, as previously discussed.

The $351.6 million, or 61.0%, increase in international net sales for the year ended December
25, 2004 includes increases of 50.0% in local currencies (43.5% from acquisitions and 6.5%
internally generated primarily due to volume growth) and 11.0% due to foreign currency exchange.
The increase was primarily due to our acquisition of the Demedis Group.

The $9.3 million, or 12.5%, increase in technology net sales for the year ended December 25,
2004 includes increases of 10.4% internal growth, 1.9% acquisition growth and 0.2% due to foreign
currency exchange. The increase was primarily due to growth of our value-added products, including
software products and related services.

primarily due to lower invested surplus cash balances over the year. The $592 thousand increase in
interest expense was primarily due to our convertible debt issued in 2004, partially offset by
lower interest rates in 2004 due to interest rate swap agreements entered into in late 2003.
Other, net decreased by $1.3 million, primarily due to a $726 thousand non-recurring real estate
related gain and $517 thousand of foreign currency net gains recognized in the prior year.



Income Taxes

For the year ended December 25, 2004, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was
37.0% compared to 37.4% for the prior year period. The difference between our effective tax rates
and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we recognized a $2.0 million loss on sale, net of
tax, of a discontinued operation, in addition to the presentation of our Hospital Supply Business
as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented (refer to Note 6 in the accompanying
financial statements for further discussion).

Net Income

Net income decreased $9.3 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 25, 2004 compared to
the prior year period. A charge of $8.4 million, net of tax, related to Chiron Fluvirin

®

was
included in 2004 net income. A real estate transaction gain of $454 thousand, net of tax, and a
net loss on the sale of a discontinued operation of $2.0 million are included in 2003 net income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal capital requirements include the funding of acquisitions, working capital needs,
capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock. Working capital requirements generally
result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities, and payment terms for
receivables and payables. Because sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters
and special inventory forward buy-in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the
year, our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter
to the end of the first quarter of the following year.

We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit
facilities, private placement debt and stock issuances. Our ability to generate sufficient cash
flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for, and supply by our
vendors of, our products and services. Given current operating, economic and industry conditions,
we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable
future. We do not expect the loss of cash flows from discontinued operations to have a material
impact on our future liquidity or capital resources.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $265.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2005 compared to $191.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. This net change of $74.1
million was due primarily to our increased sales and profit and our management of working capital.

Net cash used in investing activities was $162.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to $171.8 million for the comparable prior year period. The net change of $8.9 million
was primarily due to a combination of items including lower payments for business acquisitions and
net cash receipts from the settlements of foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by increased
capital expenditures and investments. We expect to invest approximately $67.0 million during
fiscal year 2006 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems
infrastructure and to integrate certain operations. Approximately $12.3 million of such expected
capital expenditures relate to a new distribution center in France.

Net cash used in financing activities was $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $26.4 million for the prior-year period.
The net change of $65.3 million was primarily due to the issuance of convertible debt in the prior
year, partially offset by repayments of debt acquired through acquisitions in the prior year, as
well as reduced repurchases of common stock in 2005.

Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to
large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.
Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in
opportunities and our desired level of inventory.

Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations improved to 41.8
days as of December 31, 2005 from 42.8 days as of December 25, 2004. Our inventory turns from
continuing operations increased to 7.0 as of December 31, 2005 from 6.8 as of December 25, 2004.
We anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continuing sales
growth.

We have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (formerly
ID Biomedical Corporation) through 2014 which require us to pay an
amount per dose based on the prevailing market price in each
respective year. Although there are uncertainties surrounding their pending FDA approval to
distribute influenza vaccine in the United States for the 2006/2007
influenza season, we have included this purchase obligation in the
above table based on current market prices.



In 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These notes are
senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to mature on
August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, which
commenced on February 15, 2005. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion
ratio of 21.58 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is the
equivalent conversion price of $46.34 per share, under the following circumstances:

•

if the last price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion
price measured over a specified number of trading days;

•

during the five business-day period following any 10 consecutive
trading-day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10
trading-day period was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes
during that period;

•

if the notes have been called for redemption; or

•

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate
transactions, as defined in the note agreement.

Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the
principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied
in shares of our common stock. We currently have sufficient availability of funds through our
$300.0 million revolving credit facility (discussed below) along with cash on hand to fully satisfy
the cash portion of our conversion obligation. We also will pay contingent interest during any
six-month interest period beginning August 20, 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is
above specified levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August 20, 2010. The
note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August 15, 2010, 2014,
2019, 2024 and 2029 or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event.

Our $130.0 million senior notes come due on June 30, 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of
6.94% per annum. Beginning September 25, 2006, principal payments totaling $20.0 million are due
annually on our $100.0 million senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.66% per annum.
Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually.

In 2003, we entered into agreements relating to our $230.0 million senior notes to exchange
their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
weighted-average variable interest rate was 6.29%. This weighted-average variable interest rate
comprises LIBOR plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for such senior notes.

On May 24, 2005, we entered into a $300.0 million revolving credit facility with a $100.0
million expansion feature. This facility, which expires in May 2010, replaced our previous
revolving credit facility of $200.0 million, which was scheduled to expire in May 2006. As of
December 31, 2005, there were $8.2 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no
borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility.

On June 21, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a common stock
repurchase program. This program previously allowed us to repurchase up to $100.0 million in
shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5% of shares outstanding on the
announcement date. On October 31, 2005, our board authorized an additional $100.0 million of
shares in our common stock to be repurchased under this program. As of December 31, 2005, we had
repurchased $88.5 million or 2,518,110 shares under this initiative, with $111.5 million remaining.



Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to
require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at a price that approximates fair
value pursuant to a formula price as defined in the agreements. Additionally, some prior owners of
such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if
certain profitability targets are met. We accrue liabilities that may arise from these
transactions when we believe the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable
doubt.

We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months. Funding
requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion,
may change. Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and
public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with
sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.

E-Commerce

Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by
electronic online commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid
technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of online commerce will
require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to
develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and
our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.

Through our proprietary, technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety
of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name
recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to
participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways and
means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical data,
when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. However, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and
uncertainties. Reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions,
judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if
different assumptions were to be applied.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with our
audit committee, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our
financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and veterinary consumable products, as
well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts,
rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon
historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.



Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped
to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the
product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and
product returns are reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is
completed at the time of delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the
services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate
of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts
receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data,
experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may
adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect
collectibility. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to
accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments,
estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

Inventory and Reserves

Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out method. In performing our lower of cost
or market valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the
inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.

From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or
other factors expected to affect salability. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or
assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments,
estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual
impairment analyses. Such impairment analyses require the comparison of the fair value to the
carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on
valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is
available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. Although we
believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable,
making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect
such impairment analyses and our financial results.

We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments (dental, medical (including
veterinary), international and technology). Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for
the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. We
assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually
and on an interim basis whenever events or



changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important, which could trigger an interim
impairment review, include:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business; and

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived
intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of
income.

Vendor Rebates

Vendor rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are
earned. The factors we consider in estimating vendor rebate accruals include forecasted inventory
purchases and sales, in conjunction with vendor rebate contract terms, which generally provide for
increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume. Although we believe our
judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to vendor rebates are reasonable, making material
changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial
results.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade
names and customer relationships. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down
to fair value. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in determining
fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions
could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results.

Stock-Based Compensation

Through December 31, 2005, we accounted for stock option awards to employees under the
intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees.” Under this method, no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price
is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date.

We make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method of accounting (the alternative method of accounting for stock-based compensation) had been
applied as required by FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” The fair
value-based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk-free interest rates,
stock price volatility, dividend yield and weighted-average option life.

As of January 1, 2006, in connection with our adoption of FAS 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,”
(discussed below) stock-based compensation is included in our results of operations. The method
and assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation under FAS 123(R) are
similar to those used under FAS 123.



Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” This Statement
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs
liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This
Statement changes the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for
share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in FAS 123 as
originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.” This
Statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2006 and applies to all outstanding and unvested
stock-based payment awards at the date of adoption.

In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”), which discussed
the SEC’s interpretation of FAS 123(R) and the related valuation of share-based compensation for
public companies. We are assessing the requirements of both FAS 123(R) and SAB 107 and the impact
that these pronouncements will have on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per
share. We anticipate the adoption of FAS 123(R) will affect our results of operations to an extent
similar to that as presented in our FAS 123 pro forma disclosure included in the accompanying
audited financial statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” FAS 154
is a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and FAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements.” This Statement requires voluntary changes in accounting
to be accounted for retrospectively and all prior periods to be restated as if the newly adopted
policy had always been used, unless impracticable. Previously, APB Opinion No. 20 required most
voluntary changes in accounting to be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change
in accounting in net income in the period of change. This Statement also requires a change in
method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for a long-lived asset be accounted for as a
change in estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. FAS 154 is effective for
us beginning January 1, 2006. When adopted, this Statement could have an impact on prior year
consolidated financial statements if we have a change in accounting.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 05-2, The Meaning of “Conventional Convertible Debt
Instrument” in EITF Issue 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.” This issue attempts to define “conventional
convertible debt instrument” to help clarify the appropriate accounting for such instruments. We
do not anticipate this issue will have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks, which include changes in interest rates, as well as changes in
foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other. We attempt to
minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap
contracts. These hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and
currency exchange risks. Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include
volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments. All
interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of
hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated
interest rate and currency exposure. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We have fixed rate senior notes of $130.0 million at 6.94% and $100.0 million at 6.66%.
During 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates
for variable interest rates. The variable rates are comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and reset
on the interest due dates for the senior notes. As a result of these interest rate swap
agreements, as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements, we are exposed
to risk from changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates
would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.4 million.

As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other
non-current liabilities was $7.4 million, which represented the amount that would be paid upon
unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time. Changes in
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to non-current
assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the $230.0 million
notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective.

Foreign Currency Agreements

The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may affect our
financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our
revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in
U.S. dollars. Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs, using primarily foreign
currency forward and swap contracts, aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on earnings. We purchase short-term (i.e., twelve months or less) foreign currency
forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long-term
intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases
to foreign vendors. We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars,
as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.

As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with
notional amounts of $395.6 million, of which $353.5 million related to intercompany debt and $42.1
million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors. The contracts hedge currency
fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar for Euros ($277.4 million), British Pounds ($38.0 million),
Australian Dollars ($8.1 million), Swiss Francs ($1.9 million), Japanese Yen ($394 thousand) and
Canadian Dollars ($8.4 million). In addition, our international business entered into hedges
against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies. The notional amount of such
contracts was $61.4 million. A hypothetical 5% change of the value of the U.S. Dollar would change
the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by $16.3 million.

As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements, which
expire through December 4, 2006, recorded in other current assets was $4.0 million, as determined
by quoted market prices. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we had realized net gains of $4
thousand and unrealized gains of $1.4 million relating to such agreements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of
December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Henry Schein, Inc. at December 31, 2005
and December 25, 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Henry Schein, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and
our report dated February 21, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1
— Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

We distribute healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare
practitioners in the combined North American and European markets, with operations in the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal,
Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel, Australia and New
Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of
our wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are
greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned, are accounted for under the
equity method. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fiscal Year

We report our operations and cash flows on a 52-53 week basis ending on the last Saturday of
December. The year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of 53 weeks and each of the years ended
December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 consisted of 52 weeks.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and veterinary consumable products, as
well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts,
rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon
historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped
to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the
product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and
product returns are reasonably estimable.

Note 1

Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is
completed at the time of delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the
services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly-liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of
funds on deposit of $47.0 million and $32.7 million, primarily related to payments for inventory,
were classified as accounts payable as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004.

Available-for-sale Securities

Our available-for-sale securities consist of short-term tax-efficient municipal auction rate
securities, which have a high degree of liquidity and are reflected at fair value.

We determine cost of investments in available-for-sale securities on a specific identification
basis. Gross realized gains and losses were immaterial in all periods presented. The securities
held on December 31, 2005 had contractual maturities of up to one year. There were no
available-for-sale securities as of December 25, 2004.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects
our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The reserve for accounts receivable
is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. In addition to reviewing
delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including
historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our
assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect
collectibility.

Inventory and Reserves

Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out method. In performing our lower of cost
or market



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory,
historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends. From time to time, we may
adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect
the value of inventory.

Direct Shipping and Handling Costs

Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales. Direct handling costs,
which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise
prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general
and administrative expenses. These costs from continuing operations were $39.4 million, $31.9
million and $24.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Advertising and Promotional Costs

We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred. Total advertising and
promotional expenses from continuing operations were $19.8 million, $21.7 million and $18.4 million
for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection
with direct marketing, including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the period which is benefited,
generally not exceeding one year. As of December
31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, we had $3.5 million and $3.4 million of deferred direct marketing
expenses included in other current assets.

Vendor Rebates

Vendor rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are
earned. The factors we consider in estimating vendor rebate accruals include forecasted inventory
purchases and sales, in conjunction with vendor rebate contract terms, which generally provide for
increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser
of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation is computed primarily under the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings and permanent improvements


Machinery and warehouse equipment

Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software. Costs incurred
during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside
vendors for our use and software developed by a vendor for our proprietary use are capitalized. Costs incurred for
our own personnel who are directly associated with software development may also be capitalized.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future
tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes
in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
will be recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined
using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in earnings.

Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to manage the impact that interest rate and
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair
values, earnings and cash flows. Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts
used as hedges be effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be
designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. We do not enter into derivative
instruments for speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments include interest rate swap agreements related to our long-term
fixed rate debt and foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans and
certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign vendors.

Our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges. The terms of our
interest rate swap agreements are identical to the Senior Notes and consequently qualify for an
assumption of no ineffectiveness under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“FAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Both
the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying Senior Notes are marked-to-market through
earnings at the end of each period; however, since our interest rate swap agreements are deemed
fully effective, these mark-to-market adjustments have no net impact on earnings.

Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans are designated
as either fair value hedges (loans expected to be repaid within the foreseeable future) or net
investment



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

hedges (loans not expected to be repaid within the foreseeable future) and our foreign currency
forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loan interest payments are designated as cash
flow hedges. Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to forecasted inventory
purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges.

For fair value hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with the translation gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded in earnings.
For net investment hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For cash flow hedges,
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is also recorded as a component of other comprehensive
income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings.

We record the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the
same category on our consolidated statement of cash flows as the cash
flows related to the hedged item.

Acquisitions

The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.
Any excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Certain acquisitions provide for contingent consideration, primarily cash, to be paid
in the event certain financial performance targets are satisfied over future periods. We have not
accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions because the outcome of the
contingencies is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual
impairment analyses. Such impairment analyses require a comparison of the fair value to the
carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on
valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is
available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. We regard
our reporting units to be our operating segments (dental, medical (including veterinary),
international and technology). Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of
preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results;



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business (e.g. decision to divest a business); or

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that indefinite-lived intangible assets
are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade
names and customer relationships. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down
to fair value.

Cost of Sales

The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product (net of purchase
discounts, vendor chargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges. Costs related
to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of
our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expense along with
other operating costs.

As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks
throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution
companies. Total distribution network costs from continuing operations were $42.5 million, $41.5
million and $31.9 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock option awards under the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” Under this method, no compensation expense is recorded, provided the exercise price is
equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date.

We make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method of accounting (the alternative method of accounting for stock-based compensation) had been
applied as required by FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” The fair
value-based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk-free interest rates, stock
price volatility, dividend yield and weighted-average option life.

Under the accounting provisions of FAS 123, our net income and earnings per share would have
been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below. The prior period pro forma
amounts have been adjusted as a result of revising our calculation of the fair value of stock-based
compensation. These adjustments were not material to pro forma net income or earnings per share.

Based on these assumptions, the estimated fair value of options granted for 2005, 2004

As of January 1, 2006, in connection with our adoption of FAS 123(R) “Share-Based Payment,”
stock-based compensation is included in our results of operations. The method and assumptions used
to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation under FAS 123(R) are similar to those used
under FAS 123. Additionally, we expect the effect of adopting FAS 123(R) on our results of
operations to approximate the effect presented in the pro forma disclosure above.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded
directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income
and foreign currency translation adjustments, but also includes unrealized gains (losses) on
hedging activity and marketable securities and pension adjustments.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” This Statement
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs
liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This
Statement changes the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for
share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in FAS 123 as
originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.” This
Statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2006 and applies to all outstanding and unvested
stock-based payment awards at the date of adoption.

In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”), which discussed
the SEC’s interpretation of FAS 123(R) and the related valuation of share-based compensation for
public companies. We are assessing the requirements of both FAS 123(R) and SAB 107 and the impact
that these pronouncements will have on our consolidated results of operation and earnings per
share. We anticipate the adoption of FAS 123(R) will affect our results of operations to an
extent similar to that as presented in our FAS 123 pro forma disclosure previously disclosed.

In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” FAS 154
is a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and FAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements.” This Statement requires voluntary changes in accounting
to be accounted for retrospectively and all prior periods to be restated as if the newly adopted
policy had always been used, unless impracticable. Previously, APB Opinion No. 20 required most
voluntary changes in accounting to be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change
in accounting in net income in the period of change. This Statement also requires a change in
method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for a long-lived asset be accounted for as a
change in estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. FAS 154 is effective for
us beginning January 1, 2006. When adopted, this Statement could have an impact on prior year
consolidated financial statements if we have a change in accounting.

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — (Continued)

In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 05-2, The Meaning of “Conventional Convertible Debt
Instrument” in EITF Issue 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.” This issue attempts to define “conventional
convertible debt instrument” to help clarify the appropriate accounting for such instruments. We do not
anticipate this issue will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Note 2 — Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Our diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to
basic earnings per share, except it reflects the effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of
stock options using the treasury stock method in periods in which they have a dilutive effect.

For the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, diluted earnings per share does
not include the effect of common shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt because
the principal is required to be settled in cash. If at any time, the debt is convertible at a
premium as a result of the conditions of the debt, the amount in excess of the principal would be
presumed settled in common shares and thereby reflected in our calculation of diluted earnings per
share.

A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share follows:

outstanding during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were excluded from each respective year’s computation of
diluted earnings per share. In each of these years, such options’ exercise prices exceeded the
average market price of our common stock, thereby causing the effect of such options to be
anti-dilutive.

Non-compete agreements represent amounts paid primarily to key employees and prior owners
of acquired businesses in exchange for placing restrictions on their ability to pose a competitive
risk to us. Such amounts are amortized, on a straight-line basis over the respective non-compete
period, which generally commences upon termination of employment or separation from us. The
weighted-average non-compete period for agreements currently being amortized was approximately 5
years as of December 31, 2005.

Trademarks, trade names and customer relationships were established through business
acquisitions. Certain trademarks and trade names, totaling $23.5 million and $25.7 million as of
December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, are deemed indefinite-lived intangible assets and are not
amortized. The remainder are deemed definite-lived and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
a weighted-average period of approximately 3 years as of December 31, 2005. Customer relationships
and lists are definite-lived intangible assets that are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
weighted-average period of approximately 10 years as of December 31, 2005.

Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
$14.9 million, $9.7 million and $2.8 million. The annual amortization expense expected for the
years 2006 through 2010 is $13.7 million, $11.6 million, $10.1 million, $9.3 million and $8.7
million.

Acquisitions

On January 11, 2005, we acquired the dental products distribution business of Ash Temple

with annual revenues of approximately $100.0 million. We recorded $16.5 million of goodwill
related to this acquisition. The operating results of Ash Temple are reflected in the accompanying
financial statements since the date of acquisition.

Ash Temple offers dental supplies, equipment, artificial teeth and repair parts, as well as
services including office design and planning, equipment lease financing and limited consulting.
Ash Temple was one of the largest diversified dental companies in Canada with 14 branches,
including five distribution centers, servicing all 10 Canadian provinces. Ash Temple operations
have been combined with Henry Schein Arcona, our Canadian dental business, which is currently operating under the new name Henry
Schein Ash Arcona.

On April 18, 2005, regulatory authorities approved our pending acquisition of our Demedis
Group’s business in Austria, which operates under the Austrodent brand. This approval was
contingent upon our divesting, at closing, a portion of Austrodent’s business, not using the
Austrodent name, as well as other restrictions. Of the total purchase price for the Demedis Group
(discussed below), $13.5 million was attributable to Austrodent, which was paid in 2004 and
recorded as an other current asset. Upon acquiring Austrodent, this amount, less approximately
$1.2 million received in exchange for the divested portion of the business, was reclassified based
on the fair value of the remaining assets and liabilities
acquired, with an increase of $8.6 million to goodwill for the excess purchase price over fair
value.

Note 6 — Business Acquisitions and Divestitures — (Continued)

In addition to the Ash Temple and Austrodent acquisitions, we completed other acquisitions in
Australia, New Zealand and the United States, which resulted in our recording approximately $11.5
million of goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations during the year ended December
31, 2005. These acquisitions were immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

On June 18, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of Demedis GmbH (excluding
its Austrian operations discussed above), which is a leading full-service distributor of dental
consumables and equipment in Germany, Austria, and the Benelux countries; and Euro Dental Holding
GmbH, which included KRUGG S.p.A., which we believe is Italy’s leading distributor of dental
consumable products, and DentalMV GmbH (otherwise known as Muller & Weygandt, or “M&W”). We refer
to these entities collectively as the “Demedis Group.”

As part of our agreement with the German regulatory authorities entered into prior to
acquiring the Demedis Group, we agreed to divest M&W shortly after the consummation of the
acquisition, effected through exercising a put option back to the previous owners. On July 16,
2004, this divestiture was completed for approximately $62.2 million, including the assumption of
debt of approximately $34.2 million, resulting in a reduction of the purchase price for the Demedis
Group.

As part of the agreement to divest M&W, we were entitled to receive 50% of the net sale
proceeds in excess of EUR 55.0 million, in the event M&W was subsequently resold before June 18,
2005. On September 24, 2004, an agreement was signed to resell M&W for an amount that resulted in our
realizing a share of the net sale proceeds equal to approximately $32.4 million, which we received
in October 2004. This amount was treated as a further reduction of the purchase price for the
Demedis Group.

In addition to the Demedis Group acquisition, we completed other acquisitions and made
earn-out payments that resulted in recording additional goodwill during 2004. These transactions
were immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we acquired eight healthcare distribution businesses,
which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

Divestitures

During the third quarter ended September 24, 2005, we reached a decision to divest our
hospital supply business (“Hospital Supply Business”) which is a component of our healthcare
distribution business. The primary reason for this decision was that the Hospital Supply Business
does not focus on our core customer, namely the office-based practitioner, and therefore provides
little or no synergies with our core operations.

We have classified the operating results of the Hospital Supply Business as a discontinued
operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. In
connection with this divestiture, we assessed our long-lived assets for impairment, which resulted
in us recording in the third quarter an impairment charge of $11.9 million ($7.0 million after-tax)
for the full write-down of all long-lived assets, including goodwill of $4.6 million.

Note 6 — Business Acquisitions and Divestitures — (Continued)

On March 6, 2006, we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our
Hospital Supply Business, as well as our extended care business the results of which are not
material. The purchase price is $40.0 million, with $29.5 million due at closing and $10.5 million
due 90 days after closing, subject to certain post-closing contingent payments by us described
below. The closing is conditioned upon the buyer obtaining financing and our entering into a
transition services agreement with the buyer, as well as other customary closing conditions. Based
on this sale agreement, we expect to record a loss on disposal, net of tax, of between $21.0
million and $24.0 million or $0.24 and $0.27 per diluted share, at the time of closing, which will
be presented as part of the results from discontinued operations.

We agreed to make payments to the buyer, up to a maximum of $13.0 million,
contingent upon the collection of specified accounts receivable within one year and contingent upon
the maintenance of a specified level of aggregate sales of the Hospital Supply Business during the
two-year post-closing period. Any payments made in connection with
these contingencies will be presented as part of the results from
discontinued operations.

Net sales generated by our Hospital Supply Business were $152.8 million, $161.8 million and
$159.8 million for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003. The carrying amounts of the major classes
of the Hospital Supply Business assets held-for-sale as of December 31, 2005 included accounts
receivable, net of reserves, of approximately $43.9 million and inventories, net of reserves, of
approximately $16.2 million.

On August 29, 2003, we sold PMA Bode GmbH, an x-ray film distribution business located in
Germany, which was a component of our healthcare distribution business. PMA Bode generated annual
net sales of approximately $31.0 million. The loss recorded on the sale of PMA Bode was
approximately $2.0 million (net of $54 tax benefit) and is included in the income (loss) from
discontinued operations in our statements of income. Due to immateriality, we have not reflected
the operating results, other than the loss on sale, of PMA Bode separately as a discontinued
operation for any of the periods presented.

Note 7 — Debt

Bank Credit Lines

We have a $300.0 million revolving credit facility with a $100.0 million expansion feature.
This facility, which expires in May 2010, replaced our previous revolving credit facility of $200.0
million, which was scheduled to expire in May 2006. The interest rate is based on USD LIBOR plus a
spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter. The agreement
provides, among other things, that we maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage
ratios, and contains restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, employee and
shareholder loans, disposal of businesses and certain changes in ownership. As of December 31,
2005, there were $8.2 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings
outstanding under this revolving credit facility.

Note 7 — Debt — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2005, we had various short-term bank credit lines available, of which
$2.1 million was outstanding. Such credit lines bear interest at rates ranging from 1.7% to 8.5%,
and were collateralized by certain assets with an aggregate net carrying value of $14.6 million at
December 31, 2005.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we issued $130.0
million and $100.0 million in Senior Notes. The $130.0 million notes mature on June 30, 2009 and
bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.94% per annum. Principal payments on the $100.0 million notes
totaling $20.0 million annually are due starting September 25, 2006 and bear interest at a fixed
rate of 6.66% per annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually.

In 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to our $230.0 million Senior
Notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The weighted-average
variable interest rate was 6.29% as of December 31, 2005. This weighted-average variable rate is
comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates of the Senior Notes. The
interest rate swap agreements are marked-to-market at each balance sheet date, with an offsetting
adjustment to the Senior Notes.

The agreement governing our Senior Notes provides, among other things, that we will maintain
on a consolidated basis, certain leverage and priority debt ratios and a minimum net worth. The
agreement also contains restrictions relating to transactions with affiliates, annual dividends,
mergers and acquisitions and liens. The agreements limit the distribution of dividends without the
prior written consent of the lenders (limited to $25.0 million, plus 80% of cumulative net income,
plus net proceeds from the issuance of additional capital stock.) As of December 31, 2005, the
amount of retained earnings free of restrictions was $412.3 million.

In 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These notes are
senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to mature on
August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year which
commenced on February 15, 2005. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion
ratio of 21.58 shares

per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is the equivalent conversion
price of $46.34 per share, under the following circumstances:

•

if the last price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion
price measured over a specified number of trading days;

•

during the five business-day period following any 10 consecutive
trading-day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10
trading-day period was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes
during that period;

•

if the notes have been called for redemption; or

•

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified
corporate transactions, as defined in the note agreement.

Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the
principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied
in shares of our common stock. We also will pay contingent interest during any six-month interest
period beginning August 15, 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is above specified
levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August 20, 2010. The note holders may
require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August 15, 2010, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029
or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event.

As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturing in each of the next
five years are as follows: 2006 — $33.0 million; 2007 — $25.9 million; 2008 — $22.8 million; 2009
- - $151.8 million; 2010 — $21.6 million.

Note 8 — Income Taxes — (Continued)

The deferred tax asset is realizable as we have sufficient taxable income in prior years
and anticipate sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the tax benefit for deductible
temporary differences.

As of December 31, 2005, we have domestic unconsolidated net operating loss carryforwards of
$15.4 million, which are available to offset future federal taxable income through 2025. Foreign
net operating losses totaled $209.0 million as of December 31, 2005. Of such losses, $4.9 million
can be utilized against future foreign income through 2012 and $204.1 million has an indefinite
life.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been, and will continue to be reinvested. These
earnings could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign
earnings were loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate, or if we should sell our stock in the foreign
subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might
be payable on the foreign earnings; however, we believe that foreign tax credits may substantially
offset any U.S. tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2005, the cumulative amount of reinvested
earnings was approximately $15.9 million.

Note 9 — Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash equivalents and trade receivables

— Due to the short-term maturity of such instruments, the
carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Available-for-sale securities

— The fair value of available-for-sale securities is estimated
based on quoted market prices for such securities.

Long-term investments and notes receivable

— There are no quoted market prices available for
investments in unconsolidated affiliates and long-term notes receivable; however, we believe the
carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 9 — Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk — (Continued)

Long-term debt

— The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market
prices for our traded debt and on market prices of similar issues for our private debt. The
fair value of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 was estimated at $518.9 million and
$540.2 million.

Derivative instruments

— The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate
swap agreements are estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers. Such instruments are carried at
fair value on the balance sheet. The fair value (liability) of our foreign currency forward contracts as
of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 was estimated at $4.0 million and $(1.2) million
which approximated contract value. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was
estimated at $(7.4) million and $(1.4) million, representing the estimated amounts we would have
paid to terminate the agreements as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004. These amounts
take into account current interest rates, market expectations for future interest rates and our
current creditworthiness.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. These
financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, trade
receivables, long-term investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments. In all cases, our
maximum exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments.
We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have historically been within
our expectations. We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk,
except for long-term notes receivable.

With respect to our cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, short-term and long-term
investments and derivative instruments, our credit risk is limited due to our counter-parties being
high-credit quality financial institutions. As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of
credit exposure by utilizing numerous different counter-parties.

With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively
large customer base and its dispersion across different types of healthcare professionals and
geographic areas. No single customer accounted for more than 1.1% of our net sales in 2005.

Our long-term notes receivable represent strategic financing arrangements with certain
industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses. Generally, these
notes are secured by certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other
commercial financial institutions. While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of
non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and
operational performance.

Note 10 — Segment and Geographic Data

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The
healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical (including veterinary)
and international operating segments. Products distributed consist of consumable products, small
equipment, laboratory

products, large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical
products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves office-based dental practices, schools and other institutions in the
combined United States and Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office-based physician
practices, as well as surgical centers and other alternate-care settings, veterinarian clinics and other
institutions throughout the United States. Our international group serves practices in 17
countries outside of North America and is what we believe to be a leading European healthcare supplier serving office-based
practices.

Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to
healthcare providers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice
solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and
veterinary clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing
education services for practitioners.

Note 11 — Stockholders’ Equity

On January 31, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a dividend. This stock split became effective on February 28, 2005
and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in the accompanying financial
statements and footnotes.

Effective May 25, 2005, we increased our authorized common shares from 120,000,000 to
240,000,000 in connection with the above stock split.

Common Stock Purchase Rights

On November 30, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the “Rights
Plan”), and declared a dividend under the Rights Plan of one common stock purchase right (a
“Right”) on each outstanding share of our common stock. Until the occurrence of certain events,
each share of common stock that is issued will also have attached to it a Right. The Rights
provide, in substance, that should any person or group acquire 15% or more of our outstanding
common stock after the date of adoption of the Rights Plan, each Right, other than Rights held by
the acquiring person or group, would entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of
common stock for 50% of the then-current market value of the common stock. Unless a 15%
acquisition has occurred, we may redeem the Rights at any time prior to the termination date of the
Rights Plan. This Right to purchase the common stock at a discount will not be triggered by a
person’s or group’s acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer which is for all outstanding shares at a price and on terms that the Board of Directors
determines (prior to acquisition) to be adequate and in the stockholders’ best interests. In
addition, the Right will not be triggered by the positions of existing shareholders.

Certain business combinations involving an acquiring person or its affiliates will trigger an
additional feature of the Rights. Each Right, other than Rights held by the acquiring person or
group, will entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring person at a price equal to 50% of the market value of such shares at the time of
exercise. Initially, the Rights will be attached to, and trade with, the certificates representing
our outstanding shares of common stock and no separate certificates representing the Rights will be
distributed. The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires, or commences a
tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of our common stock.

The Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all, but not less than all of the then
outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of (a)
any person or group acquiring 15% or more of our common stock or (b) the final expiration date of
November 30, 2008.

Note 12 — Employee Benefit Plans

Stock Options

We established the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for the benefit of certain
employees. As amended and restated effective as of April 1, 2004, pursuant to this plan we may
issue up to approximately 20,159,270 shares of our common stock. The Plan provides for two classes
of options: Class A options and Class B options. A total of 475,794 Class A options were issued to
certain executive management in 1995, all of which were exercised as of December 31, 2005. Both
incentive and non-qualified stock options may be issued under the Plan.

Note 12 — Employee Benefit Plans — (Continued)

The exercise price of all Class B options issued has been equal to the market price on the
date of grant, and accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized. Substantially all Class
B options issued prior to 2004 vest evenly over three years from the date of grant; however shares
exercised in the second and third year after the date of grant may not be sold until the third
anniversary of the date of grant. Substantially all Class B options issued in 2004 and 2005 vest
evenly over four years; however shares exercised in the second and third years may not be sold
until the third anniversary of the date of grant. Class B options expire on the tenth anniversary
of the date of issuance, subject to acceleration upon termination of employment.

401(k) Plans

We offer qualified, 401(k) plans to substantially all our domestic full-time employees. As
determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans are equal to 100% of
the participants’ contributions up to 7% of their base compensation. Matching contributions
include both cash and our common stock. Forfeitures attributable to participants whose employment
terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to reduce our matching contributions.

Assets of the 401(k) and other defined contribution plans are held in self-directed accounts
enabling participants to choose from various investment fund options. Matching contributions to
these plans charged to operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003 amounted to $12.4 million, $10.3
million and $7.4 million.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan to eligible
employees. This plan generally covers officers and certain highly-compensated employees after they
have reached the maximum IRS allowed pre-tax 401(k) contribution limit. Our contributions to this
plan are equal to the 401(k) employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base compensation
for the portion of the year in which such employees are not eligible to make pre-tax contributions
to the 401(k) plan. The amounts charged to operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003 amounted to $1.4
million, $566 and $839.

We have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals
(formerly ID Biomedical Corporation) through 2014 which require us
to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price in
each respective year. Although there are uncertainties surrounding their pending FDA
approval to distribute influenza vaccine in the United States for the 2006/2007 influenza season,
we have included this purchase obligation in the above table based on current market prices.

Litigation

Our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary
course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally
obtain product indemnification from our suppliers.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in
amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance

Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies — (Continued)

that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or
at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection.
In our
opinion, all pending matters, including those described below, are covered by insurance or will not
otherwise seriously harm our financial condition.

As of December 31, 2005, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we
were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not
material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for
determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and
regulations and other external factors,
including probable recoveries from third parties.

Product Liability Claims

As of December 31, 2005, we were a defendant in approximately 42 product liability cases. We
have obtained defense and indemnification commitments from the manufacturer in many of these cases.
The manufacturer has withheld indemnification in some of these cases pending product
identification.

Employment, Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements

We have employment, consulting and non-compete agreements expiring through 2010, except for a
lifetime consulting agreement with a former principal stockholder, which provides for current
compensation of $308 per year, increasing $25 every fifth year with the next increase in 2007. The
agreements provide for varying base aggregate annual payments of approximately $4.9 million, which
decrease periodically to approximately $386. In addition, some agreements have provisions for
incentive and additional compensation.

In the third quarter of 2005, we reached a decision to divest our Hospital Supply business,
which is a component of our healthcare distribution business. This decision resulted in the
recording of an impairment charge of our long-lived assets of approximately $7.0 million, net

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a $13.2 million pre-tax ($8.4 million
post-tax) charge, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to our
Fluvirin

®

contract with Chiron Corporation. This charge, which represented the write-off
of a deferred expense associated with the 2005/2006 influenza season, occurred as a result
of the significant uncertainty about whether Chiron would be able to provide Fluvirin

®

for
the 2005/2006 influenza season. The effect that this charge had on earnings per share for
the year ended December 25, 2004 was $(0.10).

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or
exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline.

Our business has been subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and
operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of
sales of software, equipment and seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and
software products), purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end
promotions. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter,
primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be
adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet or exceed market
expectations, our stock price may decline.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO Framework”).
Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31,
2005.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of
Directors

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Henry Schein Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also in our opinion, Henry
Schein, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of December 31,
2005 and December 25, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders’ equity,



and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005 and our report dated February 21, 2006, except for Note 6
which is as of March 6, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion
