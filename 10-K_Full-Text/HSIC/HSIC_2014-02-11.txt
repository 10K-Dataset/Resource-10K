PART I

ITEM 1.  Business

General

We believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  We serve more than 800,000 customers worldwide, including dental practitioners and laboratories, animal health clinics and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 81 years of experience distributing health care products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 16,000 people (of which more than 7,000 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 25 countries, including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mauritius, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

We offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and value-added solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care.  We operate through a centralized and automated distribution network with a selection of more than 96,000 branded products and Henry Schein private brand products in stock, as well as more than 110,000 additional products available as special order items.  We also offer our customers exclusive, innovative technology solutions, including practice management software and e-commerce solutions, as well as a broad range of financial services.

We have established over four million square feet of space in 61 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.

The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments.  This segment consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.

Our global technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners.

Industry

The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse.  This industry, which encompasses the dental, animal health and medical markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $45 billion in 2013 in the global markets.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.



Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.

Competition

The distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive.  Many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.  In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.  Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.

In North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental, animal health and medical products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services.  In the sale of our dental products, our primary competitors are the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company.  In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and local level.  In the animal health market, our primary competitors are MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  Our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., which are national distributors.  We also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians.  With regard to our dental practice management software, we compete against numerous companies, including Carestream Health, Inc. and the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  In the animal health practice management market, our primary competitors are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  The medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the NextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and athenahealth, Inc.

We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG & Co., Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy, Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., National Veterinary Services and Alcyon SA, as well as a large number of dental, animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in Australia, Austria, Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mauritius, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom.



Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices.  Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to continue to expand as a global value-added provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:

•

Increase penetration of our existing customer base

.  We have over 800,000 customers worldwide and we intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position as their primary supplier.

•

Increase the number of customers we serve

.  This strategy includes increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts in all of our operating segments.  In the dental business, we provide products and services to traditional dental practices as well as new emerging segments, such as dental service organizations and community health centers.  Leveraging our unique assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these new markets.  In the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers located in settings outside of the traditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail and occupational health settings.  As settings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners and providing them with the products and services they need.



•

Leverage our value-added products and services

.  We continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key product lines utilizing a consultative selling process.  In the dental business, we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental practice management software users and our dental distribution customers.  In the animal health business, we have opportunities to cross-sell practice management software and other products.  In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to health care practitioners, as well as cross-selling core products and electronic health record and practice management software.  Our strategy extends to providing health systems, integrated delivery networks and other large group and multi-site health care organizations, that include physician clinics, these same value added products and services.  As physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased access to opportunities for cross-marketing and selling our product and service portfolios.

•

Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures

.  Our acquisition strategy includes acquiring businesses and entering into joint ventures complementary to ours that will provide, among other things, additional sales to be channeled through our existing distribution infrastructure, access to additional product lines and field sales consultants and an opportunity to further expand into new geographic markets.

Markets Served

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using health care services.  Between 2013 and 2023, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12%.  Between 2013 and 2033, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 24%.  This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of approximately 8% between 2013 and 2023 and approximately 15% between 2013 and 2033.

In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases.  There is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates.  At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage.

We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency.

The animal health market, impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care, as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production, continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us.  We support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals, pharmaceuticals, supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development, sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software.

There continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’ offices, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us.  There also is the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings.  We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner.

Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model, our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist.  Through our “Schein Direct” program, we also have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:

•

timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•

timing of pricing changes offered by our vendors;

•

timing of the introduction of new products and services by our vendors;

•

timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;

•

changes in or availability of vendor contracts or rebate programs;

•

vendor rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;

•

changes in the way vendors introduce or deliver products to market;

•

costs of developing new applications and services;

•

our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;

•

exclusivity requirements with certain vendors may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other vendors;

•

loss of sales representatives;

•

costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

•

costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;

•

general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;

•

our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;

•

unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;

•

product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;

•

exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;

•

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our third-party shippers;

•

restructuring costs; and

•

changes in accounting principles.

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate.  If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.



Governmental Regulations

Operating, Security and Licensure Standards

Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Among the federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.  We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) generally regulates the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.  Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products.

The FDC Act also establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be licensed by each state in which they conduct business, provide certain drug pedigree information on the distribution of prescription drugs and act in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage, handling and record maintenance.  The newly enacted Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, which was signed into law by President Obama on November 27, 2013, amends the FDC Act with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and preempts state law.  The Drug Quality and Security Act provides that over the next 10 years the FDA will implement a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration permitting us to handle controlled substances.  We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.  We are subject to inspection by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.

Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale.  These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.  In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm.  Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation.

Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions.  There have also been increasing efforts by various levels of government to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system.



The Drug Quality and Security Act preempts state pedigree laws and requires certain entities in the pharmaceutical supply chain, including prescription drug wholesalers, to provide a paper or electronic pedigree beginning by January 1, 2015.  In addition, this law mandates that an interoperable electronic pedigree system be implemented within ten years of the law’s enactment.  The FDA is required to issue guidance and hold public meetings regarding the implementation of the pedigree requirements over the course of the next few years.

Until the pedigree provisions of the Drug Quality and Security Act begin to take effect in January 2015, current federal law in this area continues to be effective and preempts state law.  The FDC Act currently requires certain wholesalers to provide a drug pedigree for each wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, which pedigree must include an identifying statement that records the chain of ownership of a prescription drug.  Currently, the FDA, in the exercise of its enforcement discretion, requires these wholesalers to maintain drug pedigrees that include transaction dates, names and addresses regarding transactions going back to either the manufacturer or the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs.

The FDC Act also requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs.  These standards include any track and trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification, or RFID, and other technologies.  The FDA has continued to develop its policies in this area, such as issuing a Final Guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages, and issuing a final rule in September 2013 for a unique medical device identification system to be phased in over seven years, that will require most medical devices distributed in the United States to carry a unique device identifier.  The newly enacted Drug Quality and Security Act and its forthcoming implementing regulations may affect previously issued FDA guidance regarding standardized numerical identifiers.

Over the last several years, many states have implemented or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain.  This created a patchwork of state wholesale distributor licensing and drug pedigree (i.e., track and trace) requirements.  Bills have been proposed in Congress that more comprehensively address the security of the drug supply chain, including track and trace systems.  Title II of The Drug Quality and Security Act, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, will be phased in by the FDA over 10 years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.  The Drug Supply Chain Security Act provides specific track and trace requirements for manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers, and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs and requires manufacturers and wholesale distributors, by January 1, 2015, to have in place a system by which they can identify a product in their possession or control that is a “suspect product,” and to meet product tracing requirements.

The law also sets requirements for the licensing and operation of wholesalers and third party logistics (“3PL”) providers, and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  Wholesalers and 3PLs would also be required to submit annual reports to the FDA beginning on January 1, 2015, which would include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility, and contact information.

Significantly, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, beginning on its enactment date, also preempts similar state laws, thus apparently rendering unenforceable, in whole or in part, state drug pedigree laws that have already been implemented.  It also requires that prescription drug wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  While the Drug Supply Chain Security Act preempts state requirements in this area, the extent to which it preempts state requirements is unclear.  The FDA is expected to issue additional guidance and regulations to clarify these requirements.  In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the medical supply channel.  For example, Florida and certain other states have implemented or are implementing drug pedigree requirements that require that prescription drugs be distributed with records or information documenting the prior distribution of the drug, from distributors and potentially back to the manufacturers.  California enacted a law requiring the implementation of an electronic drug pedigree system that provides track and trace chain of custody technologies, such as RFID technologies.  The California law was to take effect on a staggered basis, commencing on January 1, 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers, and July 1, 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers.  We are in the process of analyzing the impact of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act on our business.



Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors.

Health Care Fraud

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws-referred to as “false claims laws”- prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.

The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of  “relators,” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  Under the federal False Claims Act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Also, violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the anti-kickback law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal anti-kickback law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.

The government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.  We had discussions with the government regarding certain of our marketing practices and have concluded such discussions in a manner that is not material to the Company.  In addition, under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the “Health Care Reform Law” (discussed in more detail in Health Care Reform, below), by September 30, 2014, the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations, which includes us.  This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years.

Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could adversely affect our business.



Health Care Reform

The Health Care Reform Law also included other provisions to reduce fraud and abuse and Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to increase federal oversight of private health insurance plans and to increase access to health coverage, some of which impact and further regulate some of our businesses.  In particular, a Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  On February 1, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released the final rule to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act.  Under this rule, data collection activities began on August 1, 2013, and first disclosure reports are due by March 31, 2014 for the period August 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013.  As required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, CMS will publish information from these reports, on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities, which according to CMS will be available to the public by September 30, 2014.

The final rule implementing the Physician Payment Sunshine Act is complex, ambiguous, and broad in scope.  CMS commentary on the final rule and more recent CMS communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors that take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements.  In addition, certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices.  Accordingly, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  It is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers, distributors, physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act preempts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws.  While we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, our compliance with the new final rule imposes additional costs on us.

On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a key provision in the Health Care Reform Law often referred to as the “individual mandate,” which will require most individuals to have health insurance in 2014, or to pay a penalty.  However, the decision also invalidated a provision in the Health Care Reform Law requiring states in 2014 to expand their Medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal Medicaid funding. The Court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement, but that it may not take away pre-existing Medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion.  Almost half the states have not yet accepted the Medicaid expansion, so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the Health Care Reform Law is uncertain.  Adding to this uncertainty, in responding to difficulties encountered in implementing Health Care Reform, the White House and federal agencies have instituted various temporary implementation delays, such as regarding the “employer mandate” that generally requires employers with 50 or more full time employees to provide certain health insurance to those employees or pay specified fines.

Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records

The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.

Certain of our businesses involve access to personal health, medical, financial and other information of individuals, and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, and require, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes, and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.



Failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities. As a result of the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), which was passed in 2009, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of HIPAA covered entities, such as health care providers. On January 17, 2013 the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services released a final rule implementing the HITECH Act and making certain other changes to HIPAA privacy and security requirements.  Compliance with the rule was required by September 23, 2013, and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses.

In addition, federal initiatives, including in particular the HITECH Act, are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The HITECH initiative includes providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives, if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology (“EHR”).  Also, eligible providers that fail to adopt certified EHR systems may be subject to Medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015.  Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services.  Initial (“stage one”) standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011.  CMS had also issued a final rule with more demanding “stage two” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals (including physicians and dentists).  CMS has indicated that it will delay rulemaking on more rigorous “stage three” criteria until 2014, and has stated that it will delay implementation of stage three measures until 2017.  Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria.

Also, HIPAA requires certain health care providers, such as physicians, to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions.  Commencing July 1, 2012, CMS required that, electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new HIPAA transaction standard, called Version 5010.  CMS has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission.  The new diagnostic code sets are called the ICD-10-CM. They were originally to be implemented on October 1, 2013, but CMS issued a final rule that extended the implementation date until October 1, 2014.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements, and while we believe we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to ICD-10-CM, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product.

International Transactions

In addition, United States and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products.  We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of requirements similar to those imposed in the United States.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business.  As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.

See “ITEM 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

The risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or the trading price of our common stock.  Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations.  You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.  The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.

The health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.

We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully.  Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors.  Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market.  Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.  Industry consolidation among health care products distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition.  In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues.

Because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.

We obtain substantially all of our products from third-party suppliers.  Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us.  Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request.  While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell.  Additionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements.  The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions.  In the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.  There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all.  An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high sales volume product, would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers.  If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be adversely affected.

Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.

Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, among others.  The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman.  We do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees.  Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.



We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:

•

timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•

timing of pricing changes offered by our vendors;

•

timing of the introduction of new products and services by our vendors;

•

timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;

•

changes in or availability of vendor contracts or rebate programs;

•

vendor rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;

•

changes in the way vendors introduce or deliver products to market;

•

costs of developing new applications and services;

•

our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;

•

exclusivity requirements with certain vendors may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other vendors;

•

loss of sales representatives;

•

costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

•

costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;

•

general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;

•

our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;

•

unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;

•

product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;

•

exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;

•

increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our third-party shippers;

•

restructuring costs; and

•

changes in accounting principles.

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate.  If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.



Expansion of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.

The medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers, obtain access to lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and develop relationships with provider networks and new GPOs, we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed.

Increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.

Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.  We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment.  Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.

Uncertain global macro-economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Uncertain global macro-economic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, including, among other things, sovereign debt levels, the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues, consumer confidence, unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population), interest rates, availability of capital, fuel and energy costs, tax rates, health care costs and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest, could adversely impact our customers and vendors, which could adversely affect us.  Government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall.  Additionally, recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sale.  We generally sell products to customers with payment terms.  If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us.  Likewise, for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.  Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.



The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.  A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:

•

the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;

•

changes in our industry and competitors;

•

our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;

•

stock repurchases;

•

any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;

•

general market and economic conditions; and

•

any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.

In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on NASDAQ.  Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies.  This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which would have an adverse effect on our business.

The health care industry is experiencing changes that could adversely affect our business.

The health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.  In recent years, the health care industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including: trends toward managed care; consolidation of health care distribution companies; consolidation of health care manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials.  Both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.  If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, the enactment of significant health care reforms could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

The implementation of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers.  We expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services, but other provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could affect us adversely.  Additionally, further federal and state proposals for health care reform are likely.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.

The Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold.  For example, (i) where we purchase medical devices from third-party manufacturers, the manufacturers may increase their prices to cover their payment of the excise tax and our costs to purchase such medical devices may therefore increase and (ii) where we manufacture medical devices or are the importer of record, our cost of goods sold have increased because we are subject to paying the excise tax.



The implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.

A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  On February 1, 2013, CMS released the final rule to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act.  Under this rule, data collection activities began on August 1, 2013, and first disclosure reports are due by March 31, 2014 for the period August 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013.  As required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, CMS will publish information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities, which according to CMS will be available to the public by September 30, 2014.

The final rule implementing the Physician Payment Sunshine Act is complex, ambiguous, and broad in scope.  CMS commentary on the final rule and more recent CMS communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors which take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements.  In addition, certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices.  Accordingly, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  It is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers, distributors, physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act preempts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws.  While we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, our compliance with the new final rule imposes additional costs on us.

Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business.

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products.  Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act.  Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:

•

regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices;

•

subject us to inspection by the FDA and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration;

•

regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;

•

require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;

•

require registration with the FDA and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and various state agencies;

•

require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;

•

require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the United States Drug Enforcement Agency;

•

require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and

•

impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.



Applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products.  Our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.  The FDA and United States Drug Enforcement Administration have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities.

The failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could negatively affect our business.  There can be no assurance that current government regulations will not adversely affect our business.  The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material.  Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses.  If it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution.  If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses.  Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs, and damage our reputation.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) laws and regulations relating to health care fraud.  Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing-related functionality.

The government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.  In addition, under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law, by September 30, 2014, the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations, which includes us.  This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs.

The applicable requirements have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity, over the past few years.  Also, significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by “relators,” who file complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws, and under the federal False Claims Act can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and federal anti-kickback law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal anti-kickback law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years.



Failure to comply with health care fraud laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response, could adversely affect our business.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.

State, federal and foreign laws, such as HIPAA, regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released.  These measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures, and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  These also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.  In addition, under the HITECH Act, which was passed in 2009, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal HIPAA privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because the businesses serve as “business associates” to our customers.  On January 17, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services released a final rule implementing the HITECH Act and making certain other changes to HIPAA privacy and security requirements.  Compliance with the rule was required by September 23, 2013, and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses.  Failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.

Our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results.

Global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things:

•

difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;

•

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;

•

repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;

•

regulatory requirements;

•

anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records;

•

unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;

•

imposition of import/export duties, quotas, sanctions or penalties;



•

difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;

•

limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;

•

unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;

•

civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; and

•

public health emergencies.

Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.

We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future.  Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock.  Some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:

•

may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;

•

requires significant management attention;

•

may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources; and

•

results in additional acquisition and integration expenses.

There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.  Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:

•

the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;

•

our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust regulations;

•

the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions; and

•

the liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets.

Our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.

We are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies.  We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions.  To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to successfully manage our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management, and financial and operational controls.  If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be adversely affected.



We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products.  Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products. As a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities.  One of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain.  In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials.  The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability.  We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection.  A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation.

Our technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing.

Competition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing.  Our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:

•

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;

•

our ability to enhance our products and services to satisfy customer requirements; and

•

our ability to provide ongoing technical support.

We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market.  Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released.  We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur.  Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software.  We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections.  We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.

We may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.

Traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions.  The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis.  The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business.



Cyber-security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could adversely affect our results of operations.

We rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, among other things:

•

maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;

•

receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•

manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;

•

process payments to suppliers; and

•

maintain certain of our customers’ electronic medical records.

A cyber-attack that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in adverse business impact.  Risks may include, among other things:

•

future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;

•

operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of IS systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities; and

•

negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our IS systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, cyber-attacks or fail for any extended period of time.

We develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based.  A cyber-attack that bypasses the security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could cause significant reputational harm.  Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.  Although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.

Failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive customer data in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could also expose us to claims, fines and penalties and costs for remediation.  Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cyber-security may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.

We have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.  Successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation.



Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.

The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  These provisions, among other things:

•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and

•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (i) remove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.

In addition, our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control.  These incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control.  Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case, within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.

Tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities.

We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives.  In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments

We have no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2013 fiscal year.

We believe that our properties are in good condition, are well maintained and are suitable and adequate to carry on our business.  We have additional operating capacity at certain distribution center facilities.

ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we may become a party to legal proceedings, including, without limitation, product liability claims, employment matters, commercial disputes, governmental inquiries and investigations, and other matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  In our opinion, pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

As of December 28, 2013, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss.  This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors, including probable recoveries from third parties.

ITEM 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures

Not applicable.

The following table summarizes repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during the fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2013:

Dividend Policy

We have not declared any cash or stock dividends on our common stock during fiscal years 2013 or 2012.  We currently do not anticipate declaring any cash or stock dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.  We intend to retain earnings to finance the expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes, including our share repurchase program.  Any declaration of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends and other factors.

Executive-Level Overview

We believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  We serve more than 800,000 customers worldwide, including dental practitioners and laboratories, animal health clinics and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 81 years of experience distributing health care products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 16,000 people (of which more than 7,000 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 25 countries, including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mauritius, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom.



We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: health care distribution and technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.  The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments.  This segment consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.

Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.  Our global technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners.

Industry Overview

In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.

Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the health care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.

Our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty, particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services.

Industry Consolidation

The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse.  This industry, which encompasses the dental, animal health and medical markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $45 billion in 2013 in the global markets.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.

Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.



The trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.  Health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician hospital organizations.  In many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  This trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.

As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure.  We also have invested in expanding our sales/marketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the office-based practitioner setting.

As the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.  If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.

Aging Population and Other Market Influences

The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the affects of increased unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Data Base, in 2013 there were more than six million Americans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care services.  By the year 2050, that number is projected to triple to approximately 18 million.  The population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 70% during the same time period.

As a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the United States.  Given current operating, economic and industry conditions, we believe that demand for our products and services will grow at slower rates.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS,  published “National Health Expenditure Projections 2012-2022” indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately $2.8 trillion in 2012, or 17.9% of the nation’s gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the United States.  Health care spending is projected to reach approximately $5.0 trillion in 2022, approximately 19.9% of the nation’s gross domestic product.



Government

Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and/or medical treatments or services.  Also, many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance.

Health Care Reform

For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.  The Health Care Reform Law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a key provision in the Health Care Reform Law, often referred to as the “individual mandate,” which will require most individuals to have health insurance in 2014, or pay a penalty.  However, the decision also invalidated a provision in the Health Care Reform Law requiring states in 2014 to expand their Medicaid programs or risk the complete loss of all federal Medicaid funding.  The Court held that the federal government may offer states the option of accepting the expansion requirement, but that it may not take away pre-existing Medicaid funds in order to coerce states into complying with the expansion.  Almost half the states have not yet accepted the Medicaid expansion, so the full extent of increased health care coverage under the Health Care Reform Law is uncertain.  Adding to this uncertainty, in responding to difficulties encountered in implementing Health Care Reform, the White House and federal agencies have instituted various temporary implementation delays, such as regarding the “employer mandate” that generally requires employers with 50 or more full time employees to provide certain health insurance to those employees or pay specified fines.

A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. On February 1, 2013, CMS released the final rule to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act.  Under this rule, data collection activities began on August 1, 2013, and first disclosure reports are due by March 31, 2014 for the period August 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013.  As required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, CMS will publish information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities, which according to CMS will be available to the public by September 30, 2014.

The final rule implementing the Physician Payment Sunshine Act is complex, ambiguous and broad in scope.  CMS commentary on the final rule and more recent CMS communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors which take title to such products are to be treated as “applicable manufacturers” subject to full reporting requirements.  In addition, certain of our subsidiaries manufacture drugs and devices. Accordingly, we will be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  It is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers, distributors, physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws.  While we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, our compliance with the new final rule imposes additional costs on us.



Health Care Fraud

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.

The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of  “relators,” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  Under the federal False Claims Act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Also, violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the anti-kickback law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal anti-kickback law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.

The government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.  In addition, under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law, discussed in more detail under “Health Care Reform” above, by September 30, 2014, the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations, which includes us.  This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity in recent years.

Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could adversely affect our business.

Operating and Security Standards

At the federal level, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, requires certain wholesalers to provide a drug pedigree for each wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, which includes an identifying statement that records the chain of ownership of a prescription drug.

Until the pedigree provisions of the Drug Quality and Security Act begin to take effect in January 2015, current federal law in this area continues to be effective and pre-empts state law.  Currently, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in exercise of its enforcement discretion, requires these wholesalers to maintain drug pedigrees that include transaction dates,



names and addresses regarding transactions going back to either the manufacturer or the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs.  The FDA has continued to develop its policies regarding the integrity of the supply chain, such as by issuing a Final Guidance in 2010 regarding standardized numerical identification for prescription drug packages and by issuing a final rule in 2013 for a unique medical device identification system, to be phased in over seven years, that will require most medical devices distributed in the United States to carry a unique device identifier.  The new requirements of the Drug Quality and Security Act may affect previously issued FDA guidance regarding standardized numerical identifiers.

Over the last several years, many states have implemented or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain.  This created a patchwork of state wholesale distributor licensing and drug pedigree (i.e., track and trace) requirements.  Bills have been proposed in Congress that more comprehensively address the security of the drug supply chain, including track and trace systems.  One important federal measure, The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, was signed into law by President Obama on November 27, 2013.  Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, will be phased in by the FDA over 10 years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.  The Drug Supply Chain Security Act provides specific track and trace requirements for manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers, and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs and requires manufacturers and wholesale distributers, by January 1, 2015, to have in place a system by which they can identify a product in their possession or control that is a “suspect product,” and to meet product tracing requirements.

The law also sets requirements for the licensing and operation of wholesalers and third party logistics (“3PL”) providers, and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  Wholesalers and 3PLs would also be required to submit annual reports to the FDA beginning on January 1, 2015, which would include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility, and contact information.

Significantly, under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, beginning on its enactment date, the Act pre-empts similar state laws, thus apparently rendering unenforceable, in whole or in part, state drug pedigree laws that have already been implemented.  Over the past few years there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government, including state departments of health, state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabelled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system.  A number of states have implemented pedigree requirements, including drug tracking requirements, which are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system.  A number of states, including Florida, have already implemented pedigree requirements, including drug tracking requirements, which are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system.  California has enacted a statute that, beginning in 2015, was intended to require manufacturers to identify each package of a prescription pharmaceutical with a standard, machine-readable unique numerical identifier, and to require manufacturers and distributors to participate in an electronic track-and-trace system and provide or receive an electronic pedigree for each transaction in the drug distribution chain.  The California law was to take effect on a staggered basis, commencing on January 1, 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers, and July 1, 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act to our business.

The federal Controlled Substances Act also regulates wholesale distribution of controlled substances and certain chemicals.  The Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act of 2010, which became effective in April 2011, requires retail sellers of products containing certain chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, to self-certify to the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) that they understand and agree to comply with the laws and regulations regarding such sales. The law also prohibits distributors from selling these products to retailers who are not registered with the DEA or who have not self-certified compliance with the laws and regulations.  Various states also impose restrictions on the sale of certain products containing pseudoephedrine and other chemicals.  The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010, signed by President Obama in October 2010, is intended to allow patients to deliver unused controlled substances to designated entities to more easily and safely dispose of controlled substances while reducing the chance of diversion.  The law authorizes the DEA to promulgate regulations to allow, but not require, designated entities to receive unused controlled substances.



Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records

The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has been developing policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.

Certain of our businesses involve access to personal health, medical, financial and other information of individuals, and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”).  HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes, and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities.  As a result of the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), which was enacted in 2009, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly affected by federal HIPAA privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as “business associates” of HIPAA covered entities, such as health care providers.  On January 17, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services released a final rule implementing the HITECH Act and making certain other changes to HIPAA privacy and security requirements.  Compliance with the rule was required by September 23, 2013, and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses.

In addition, federal initiatives, including in particular the HITECH Act, are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The HITECH initiative includes providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology (“EHR”).  Also, eligible providers that fail to adopt certified EHR systems may be subject to Medicare reimbursement reductions beginning in 2015.  Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services.  Initial (“stage one”) standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011.  CMS has also issued a final rule with more demanding “stage two” criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals (including physicians and dentists), and has indicated that it will delay rulemaking on more rigorous “stage three” criteria until 2014, and has stated that it will delay implementation of stage three measures until 2017.  Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and so must maintain compliance with these evolving governmental criteria.

Also, HIPAA requires certain health care providers, such as physicians, to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions.  Commencing July 1, 2012, CMS required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new HIPAA transaction standard, called Version 5010.  CMS has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission.  The new diagnostic code sets are called the ICD-10-CM.  They were originally to be implemented on October 1, 2013, but CMS recently issued a final rule that extended the implementation date until October 1, 2014.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements, and while we believe that we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to ICD-10-CM, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product.

There may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care.



E-Commerce

Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.

Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

Plans of Restructuring

During the year ended December 29, 2012, we incurred restructuring costs of approximately $15.2 million (approximately $10.5 million after taxes) consisting of employee severance pay and benefits related to the elimination of approximately 200 positions; facility closing costs, representing primarily lease terminations and asset write-off costs; and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan.  This restructuring program is complete and we do not expect any additional costs from this program.

Beginning with the first quarter of 2012, we have reported net sales and prior-year sales comparisons for each of our global dental, animal health and medical and global technology and value-added services business groups.

This sales reporting is consistent with our global business groups as realigned in 2012.  These groups were formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective, as well as global product and service offerings and best practices.

We will continue to report financial results for our health care distribution and technology and value-added services reportable segments.  The health care distribution segment comprises three global operating segments (dental, animal health and medical) and the technology and value-added services segment remains unchanged.

The $620.7 million, or 6.9%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 28, 2013 includes an increase of 6.8% local currency growth (3.6% increase in internally generated revenue and 3.2% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.1% related to foreign currency exchange.

The $223.5 million, or 4.7%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 28, 2013 includes an increase of 4.3% in local currencies (2.1% increase in internally generated revenue and 2.2% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.4% related to foreign currency exchange.  The 4.3% increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 3.6% (3.0% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.6% growth from acquisitions) and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 4.5% (1.8% increase in internally generated revenue and 2.7% growth from acquisitions).

The $278.3 million, or 12.0%, increase in animal health net sales for the year ended December 28, 2013 includes an increase of 12.3% local currency growth (5.5% increase in internally generated revenue and 6.8% growth from acquisitions) as well as a decrease of 0.3% related to foreign currency exchange.

The $82.2 million, or 5.3%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 28, 2013 includes an increase of 5.1% local currency growth (4.6% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.5% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.2% related to foreign currency exchange.

The $36.6 million, or 12.9%, increase in technology and value-added services net sales for the year ended December 28, 2013 includes an increase of 13.3% local currency growth (9.5% increase in internally generated revenue and 3.8% growth from acquisitions) as well as a decrease of 0.4% related to foreign currency exchange.

Gross profit increased $148.5 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 28, 2013 compared to the prior year period.  As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  Additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment.  These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services, as well as certain financial services. The software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development.

Within our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next.  Changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin.  For example, sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products.  Conversely, sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average.  With respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies.

Health care distribution gross profit increased $127.4 million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 28, 2013 compared to the prior year period.  Health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 26.5% for the year ended December 28, 2013 from 26.8% for the comparable prior year period.  The decrease in our health care distribution gross profit margin is primarily due to growth in sales within our animal health businesses, which typically include a greater percentage of lower-margin pharmaceutical products than our other operating units.

Technology and value-added services gross profit increased $21.1 million, or 11.5%, for the year ended December 28, 2013 compared to the prior year period.  Technology and value-added services gross profit margin decreased to 64.0% for the year ended December 28, 2013 from 64.8% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to changes in the product sales mix.

Other expense, net decreased $2.4 million to $12.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2013 from the comparable prior year period.  Interest income decreased $0.5 million primarily due to lower investment income.  Interest expense decreased $3.4 million primarily due to a reduction in borrowings under our Henry Schein Animal Health (“HSAH”) debt, partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our private placement facilities and increased borrowings based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable.  Other, net decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 28, 2013, our effective tax rate was 28.7% compared to 31.1% for the prior year period.  During the third quarter of 2013, we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the United States, which had been previously reserved, will be realized.  As a result, our provision for income taxes includes a $13.4 million reduction of the valuation allowance which is based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards.

Absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2013 would have been 30.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 28.7%.  The remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.  For 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 30%.

Loss on Sale of Equity Investment

On July 10, 2013, we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the Middle East that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors.  The divestiture resulted in a one-time loss of $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013.  Pursuant to the terms of this divestiture, we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million, which it was required to use to reduce its debt, pay certain trade payables and provide working capital.  The investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012.  There is no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture.

Net Income

Net income increased $48.1 million, or 11.4%, for the year ended December 28, 2013, compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.

Gross profit increased $89.5 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 29, 2012 compared to the prior year period.  As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.

Health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 26.8% for the year ended December 29, 2012 from 27.2% for the comparable prior year period.  The decrease in our health care distribution gross profit margin is primarily due to growth in sales within our animal health businesses, which typically include a greater percentage of lower-margin pharmaceutical products than our other operating units.

Technology and value-added services gross profit margin decreased to 64.8% for the year ended December 29, 2012 from 65.5% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to changes in the product sales mix and from higher support costs associated with our growing number of software and eServices customers.  Revenues generated from lower than average gross margins grew at a greater rate than traditional electronic services (e.g., claims processing) or software sales, which typically generate higher than average gross margins.

Other expense, net increased $1.9 million to $14.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2012 from the comparable prior year period.  Interest income decreased $2.2 million primarily due to lower investment income.  Interest expense increased $0.5 million primarily due to an increase in borrowings under our private placement facilities and our bank credit lines, partially offset by lower interest expense due to a reduction in borrowings under our HSAH debt.  Other, net increased by $0.8 million due primarily to a gain related to an increase in the fair value of an equity affiliate which is now being reported as a consolidated entity beginning in the third quarter of 2012.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 29, 2012, our effective tax was 31.1% compared to 31.7% for the prior year period.  The net reduction in our 2012 effective tax rate results from additional tax planning, settlements of tax audits and higher income from lower taxing countries.  The difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods related primarily to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.

Net Income

Net income increased $18.7 million, or 4.6%, for the year ended December 29, 2012 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions, purchases of additional noncontrolling interests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs, purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock.  Working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables.  Historically, sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy-in opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year.

We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt placements.  Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services, and access to products and services from our suppliers.

Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.  Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.  We anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements.

We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.  Funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change.  Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $664.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2013, compared to $408.1 million for the prior year.  The net change of $256.1 million was primarily attributable to net income improvements and favorable working capital changes attributable to inventory buy-ins that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 in advance of potential price increases related to the medical device excise tax.

Net cash used in investing activities was $266.6 million for the year ended December 28, 2013, compared to $269.6 million for the prior year.  The net change of $3.0 million was primarily due to decreased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions, partially offset by increased purchases of fixed assets, payments made related to a sale of an equity investment and reduced proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $336.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2013, compared to $170.6 million for the prior year.  The net change of $165.4 million was primarily due to increased net payments for long-term debt and decreased proceeds from issuance of stock upon exercise of stock options.

During the years ended December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, we wrote off approximately $8.3 million and $8.3 million, respectively, of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve.  Our inventory turns from operations decreased to 5.9 for the year ended December 28, 2013 from 6.2 for the year ended December 29, 2012.

Credit Facilities

On September 12, 2012, we entered into a new $500 million revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a $200 million expansion feature, which expires on September 12, 2017.  This credit facility replaced our then existing $400 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million expansion feature, which would have expired on September 5, 2013.  There were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility as of December 28, 2013.  The interest rate is based on the USD LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  The Credit Agreement provides, among other things, that we are required to maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios, and contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes (including mergers), dispositions and certain restrictive agreements.  As of December 28, 2013, there were $10.1 million of letters of credit provided to third parties under the credit facility.

As of December 28, 2013, we had various other short-term bank credit lines available, of which approximately $29.5 million was outstanding.  At December 28, 2013, borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 2.73%.



Private Placement Facilities

On August 10, 2010, we entered into $400 million private placement facilities with two insurance companies.  On April 30, 2012, we increased our available credit facilities by $375 million by entering into a new agreement with one insurance company and amending our existing agreements with two insurance companies.  These facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance, from time to time during a three year issuance period, through April 26, 2015.  The facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance.  The term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years (with an average life no longer than 12 years). The proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, to refinance existing indebtedness and/or to fund potential acquisitions.  The agreements provide, among other things, that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios, and contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.  These facilities contain make-whole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates.

Henry Schein Animal Health

During the first quarter of 2013, we repaid the then outstanding debt related to the HSAH transaction using our existing Credit Agreement.  As part of this transaction, we recorded a one-time interest expense charge of $6.2 million related to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs.

U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization

On April 17, 2013, we entered into a facility agreement of up to $300 million with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable.  The new facility allowed us to replace public debt (approximately $220 million), which had a higher interest rate at HSAH during February 2013 and provided funding for working capital and general corporate purposes.  The financing was structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  The borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $160.0 million as of December 28, 2013.  At December 28, 2013, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility is based on the average asset-backed commercial paper rate of 21 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 0.96%.

We are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if usage is greater than or equal to 50% of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if usage is less than 50% of the facility limit.

Borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of Long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet.



Divestiture of an Equity Affiliate

On July 10, 2013, we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the Middle East that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors.  The divestiture resulted in a one-time loss of $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013.  Pursuant to the terms of this divestiture, we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million, which it was required to use to reduce its debt, pay certain trade payables and provide working capital.  The investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012.  There is no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture.

Stock repurchases

From June 21, 2004 through December 28, 2013, we repurchased $1.1 billion, or 16,829,005 shares, under our common stock repurchase programs, with $300.0 million available as of December 28, 2013 for future common stock share repurchases.

Redeemable noncontrolling interests

Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.  ASC Topic 480-10 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements.  The components of the change in the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 are presented in the following table:

Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.

Additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  Any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income.

On December 30, 2011, we acquired all of Oak Hill Capital Partners’ (“OHCP”) remaining direct and indirect interests in Butler Animal Health Supply (“BAHS”) (including its interest in W.A. Butler Company) for $155 million in cash.  As a result of this transaction, our ownership in BAHS increased to approximately 71.7% at December 31, 2011.  The amount paid to OHCP for their remaining interests in BAHS was in excess of the previously agreed upon annual limits (see Note 9. “Business Acquisitions and Other Transaction” within our notes to our consolidated financial statements), but such limits were waived by all parties involved. At December 28, 2013, our ownership in BAHS is approximately 74.4%.



Unrecognized tax benefits

As more fully disclosed in Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, of $54.1 million as of December 28, 2013.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  However, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties.  Reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions, judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with our audit committee, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, animal health and medical consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the services are provided.

Revenue derived from multiple element arrangements, and the related deferral of such revenue (which is insignificant to our financial statements), is recognized as follows. When we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support) we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method, based upon vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, or defer it until such time as vendor-specific evidence of fair value is obtained. Multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service. Effective December 26, 2010 we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy: first VSOE, then third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price if VSOE is not available, and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable. Estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions. Each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. Revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided.



Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  The reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends.  From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

Inventories and Reserves

Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  In accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.

From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, animal health and medical) and technology and value-added services.

We test goodwill impairment under the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment” (“ASU 2011-08”), which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values.  The factors that we consider in developing our qualitative assessment included:

•

Macroeconomic conditions consisting of the overall sales growth of our business and the overall sales growth of each of our operating segments.  We also consider our growth in market share in the markets in which we compete;

•

Credit markets and our ability to access debt facilities at favorable terms;

•

Key personnel and management expertise, as well as our growth strategies for the next several years; and

•

Our expectations of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit.

Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.  Our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  For certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  We assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

•

significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or

•

significant negative industry or economic trends.



If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.

Beginning with the first quarter of 2012, we changed our reporting units from dental, animal health, medical, international and technology to global dental, global animal health, global medical and global technology and value-added services.

These groups have been formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective, as well as global product and service offerings and best practices.

In connection with this change in business groups, goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units.  Based upon this change, we felt it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment, in addition to a qualitative assessment, of goodwill impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter for the year ended December 29, 2012 in order to establish a new baseline calculation.

Based on a qualitative analysis, there were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through December 28, 2013 that impacted our analysis.  For the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments.

Supplier Rebates

Supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.

Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.   For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award.  Prior to March 2009, awards principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock (including restricted stock units).  Since March 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units, with the exception of stock options for certain pre-existing contractual obligations.

We estimated the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model which required us to make assumptions about the expected life of options, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates and dividend yields.

We issue restricted stock that vests solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting) and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting).



With respect to time-based restricted stock, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  With respect to performance-based restricted stock, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a three-year period as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock, based on our closing stock price at time of grant.  Adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures and share repurchases.  Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  The ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined.

Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to stock-based compensation are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.

ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.  We attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.  These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.  Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets.  All foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure.  We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital.

Foreign Currency Agreements

The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may affect our financial results.  Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.  Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings.  We purchase short-term (i.e., 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers.  We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.

As of December 28, 2013, the net notional value of our foreign currency exchange agreements, which expire through July 30, 2014, was $9.3 million, which includes a mark-to-market gain of $0.1 million as determined by quoted market prices.  A hypothetical 5% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would change the notional value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by an additional $0.1 million.

Short-Term Investments

We limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counter-parties to such financial instruments.  As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties.

(in thousands, except per share data)

Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

We distribute health care products and services primarily to office-based health care practitioners with operations or affiliates in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Mauritius, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of our controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned or investments in unconsolidated affiliates of less than 20% in which we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method.  See Note 6 for accounting treatment of Redeemable noncontrolling interests.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fiscal Year

We report our results of operations and cash flows on a 52-53 week basis ending on the last Saturday of December.  The years ended December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 consisted of 52 weeks and the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, animal health and medical consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Due to the short-term maturity of such investments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.  Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $39.6 million and $59.4 million, primarily related to payments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  The reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends.  From time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.

Direct Shipping and Handling Costs

Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.  Direct handling costs, which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Direct shipping and handling costs were $69.1 million, $64.5 million and $62.5 million for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Advertising and Promotional Costs

We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.  Total advertising and promotional expenses were $12.2 million, $10.4 million and $13.1 million for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection with direct marketing, including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period which is benefited, generally not exceeding one year.  As of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, we had $3.9 million and $3.9 million of deferred direct marketing expenses included in other current assets.

Supplier Rebates

Supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.  Depreciation is computed primarily under the straight-line method (see Note 2 - Property and Equipment, Net for estimated useful lives).  Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the lease term.

Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software.  Costs incurred during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside suppliers for our use and software developed by a supplier for our proprietary use are capitalized.  Costs incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software development are capitalized.

Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies – (Continued)

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.  In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates will be recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end.  Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.  Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.

Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our objective is to manage the impact that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair values, earnings and cash flows.  Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.  We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  Our derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related to certain intercompany loans and certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign suppliers.

Our foreign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges.  Our foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency balance sheet exposure provide economic hedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

For agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative, along with the transaction gain or loss on the hedged item, are recorded in earnings.  For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

We classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our consolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related to the hedged item.

Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies – (Continued)

Acquisitions

The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.  Any excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  The major classes of assets and liabilities that we generally allocate purchase price to, excluding goodwill, include identifiable intangible assets (i.e., trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and lists and non-compete agreements), property, plant and equipment, deferred taxes and other current and long-term assets and liabilities.  The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on critical estimates, judgments and assumptions derived from: analysis of market conditions; discount rate; discounted cash flows; customer retention rates; and estimated useful lives.  Some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  For the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, there were no material adjustments recorded in our consolidated statement of income relating to changes in estimated contingent purchase price liabilities.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.  Their interests in these subsidiaries are classified outside permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are carried at the estimated redemption amounts.  The redemption amounts have been estimated based on expected future earnings and cash flow and, if such earnings and cash flow are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.  Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are reflected at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, animal health and medical) and technology and value-added services.

We test goodwill for impairment under the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment” (“ASU 2011-08”), which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values.  The factors that we consider in developing our qualitative assessment included:

•

Macroeconomic conditions consisting of the overall sales growth of our business and the overall sales growth of each of our operating segments.  We also consider our growth in market share in the markets in which we compete;

•

Credit markets and our ability to access debt facilities at favorable terms;

•

Key personnel and management expertise, as well as our growth strategies for the next several years; and

•

Our expectations of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(in thousands, except per share data)

Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies – (Continued)

Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.  Our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  For certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  We assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:

•

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

•

significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or

•

significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.

Beginning with the first quarter of 2012, we changed our reporting units from dental, medical, animal health, international and technology to global dental, global animal health, global medical and global technology and value-added services.

These groups have been formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective, as well as global product and service offerings and best practices.

In connection with this change in business groups, goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units.  Based upon this change, we felt it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment, in addition to a qualitative assessment, of goodwill impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter for the year ended December 29, 2012 in order to establish a new baseline calculation.

Based on a qualitative analysis, there were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through December 28, 2013 that impacted our analysis.  For the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.

Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.  For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.

Cost of Sales

The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product (net of purchase discounts, supplier chargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges.  Costs related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expenses along with other operating costs.

As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  Total distribution network costs were $62.2 million, $59.5 million and $59.1 million for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity.  Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on hedging and investment activity and pension adjustments.

Non-compete agreements represent amounts paid primarily to key employees and prior owners of acquired businesses, as well as certain sales persons, in exchange for placing restrictions on their ability to pose a competitive risk to us.  Such amounts are amortized, on a straight-line basis over the respective non-compete period, which generally commences upon termination of employment or separation from us.  The weighted-average non-compete period for agreements currently being amortized was approximately 5.6 years as of December 28, 2013.

Trademarks, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships were established through business acquisitions.  Definite-lived trademarks and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 8.5 years as of December 28, 2013.  Customer relationships and customer lists are definite-lived intangible assets that are amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 11.0 years as of December 28, 2013.

Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $69.2 million, $68.5 million and $58.8 million.  The annual amortization expense expected for the years 2014 through 2018 is $62.6 million, $57.3 million, $51.6 million, $47.9 million and $42.4 million.

Credit Facilities

On September 12, 2012, we entered into a new $500 million revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a $200 million expansion feature, which expires on September 12, 2017.  This credit facility replaced our then existing $400 million revolving credit facility with a $100 million expansion feature, which would have expired on September 5, 2013.  There were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility as of December 28, 2013.  The interest rate is based on USD LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  The Credit Agreement provides, among other things, that we are required to maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios, and contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes (including mergers), dispositions and certain restrictive agreements.  As of December 28, 2013, there were $10.1 million of letters of credit provided to third parties under the credit facility.

As of December 28, 2013, we had various other short-term bank credit lines available, of which approximately $29.5 million was outstanding.  At December 28, 2013, borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 2.73%.

Private Placement Facilities

On August 10, 2010, we entered into $400 million private placement facilities with two insurance companies.  On April 30, 2012, we increased our available credit facilities by $375 million by entering into a new agreement with one insurance company and amending our existing agreements with two insurance companies.  These facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance, from time to time during a three year issuance period, through April 26, 2015.  The facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance.  The term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years (with an average life no longer than 12 years). The proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, to refinance existing indebtedness and/or to fund potential acquisitions.  The agreements provide, among other things, that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios, and contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.  These facilities contain make-whole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates.

The components of our private placement facility borrowings as of December 28, 2013 are presented in the following table:

Henry Schein Animal Health

During the first quarter of 2013, we repaid the then outstanding debt related to the Henry Schein Animal Health (“HSAH”), formerly Butler Schein Animal Health, transaction using our existing Credit Agreement.  As part of this transaction, we recorded a one-time interest expense charge of $6.2 million related to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs.

U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization

On April 17, 2013, we entered into a facility agreement of up to $300 million with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable.  The new facility allowed us to replace public debt (approximately $220 million), which had a higher interest rate at HSAH during February 2013 and provided funding for working capital and general corporate purposes.  The financing was structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  The borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $160 million as of December 28, 2013.  At December 28, 2013, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility is based on the average asset-backed commercial paper rate of 21 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 0.96%.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC Topic 820”) provides a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles.

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).

The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:

•

Level 1— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.

•

Level 2— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

•

Level 3— Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.

The following section describes the valuation methodologies that we used to measure different financial instruments at fair value.

Investments and notes receivable

There are no quoted market prices available for investments in unconsolidated affiliates and notes receivable; however, we believe the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Debt

The fair value of our debt as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012 was estimated at $485.2 million and $533.3 million, respectively.  Factors that we considered when estimating the fair value of our debt include market conditions, prepayment and make-whole provisions, liquidity levels in the private placement market, variability in pricing from multiple lenders and term of debt.

Derivative contracts

Derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable and unobservable inputs.  We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related to intercompany loans and certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with suppliers.

The fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts are obtained by comparing our contract rate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which is based on market rates for comparable transactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Redeemable noncontrolling interests

Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on third-party valuations.  The primary factor affecting the future value of redeemable noncontrolling interests is expected earnings and, if such earnings are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.  The noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted to their estimated redemption amounts each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.  The values for Redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The details of the changes in Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented in Note 6.

The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012:

Business Acquisitions, Divestiture and Other Transaction

Acquisitions

The operating results of all acquisitions are reflected in our financial statements from their respective acquisition dates.

We completed certain acquisitions during the year ended December 28, 2013, which were immaterial to our financial statements individually and in the aggregate and resulted in the recording of approximately $14.7 million of initial goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations.  Total acquisition transaction costs incurred in the year ended December 28, 2013 were immaterial to our financial results.

We completed certain acquisitions during the year ended December 29, 2012, which were immaterial to our financial statements individually and in the aggregate and resulted in the recording of approximately $128.0 million of initial goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations.

On December 31, 2010, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Provet Holdings Limited (ASX: PVT), an Australasian distributor of veterinary products with sales in its 2010 fiscal year of approximately $278 million, for approximately $91 million, in a cash-for-stock exchange.  As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $27.0 million of goodwill.

In addition to the Provet Holdings Limited acquisition, we completed other acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2011, the operating results of which are reflected in our financial statements from their respective acquisition dates.  These other acquisitions individually and in the aggregate had an immaterial impact on our reported operating results and resulted in the recording of approximately $38.8 million of initial goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations.

Subsequent Acquisitions

On December 30, 2013, we completed the acquisition of an approximately 60% equity investment in BioHorizons, Inc., a U.S.-based manufacturer of advanced dental implants with annual revenues of approximately $115 million.  Prior to completion of the acquisition, we funded BioHorizons, Inc. $145 million, which is recorded as a long-term loan included in Investments and Other within our consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2013.  This long-term loan was subsequently recorded as an intercompany loan upon completion of the acquisition and will be eliminated from our consolidated balance sheet in future reporting periods.

On January 6, 2014, we announced that we will acquire 100% ownership of five businesses in three European countries from Arseus NV.  The businesses combine for annual sales of approximately $97 million and include a dental practice management software company in France and distributors of dental products in France, the Netherlands and Belgium.  This transaction was completed during the first quarter of 2014.

Note 9 – Business Acquisitions, Divestiture and Other Transaction – (Continued)

Divestiture of an Equity Affiliate

On July 10, 2013, we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the Middle East that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors.  The divestiture resulted in a one-time loss, which is recorded in a separate line item, “Loss on sale of equity investment” within our consolidated statements of income and within the cash flows from operating activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows, of $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013.  Pursuant to the terms of this divestiture, we made cash payments, which are recorded in a separate line item, “Payments related to sale of equity investment”, within the cash flows from investing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows, to this distributor in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million, which it was required to use to reduce its debt, pay certain trade payables and provide working capital.  The investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012.  There is no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture.

Loan and Investment Agreement

On December 12, 2008, we converted $10.4 million of loan receivables and related accrued interest into an equity interest of 15.33% in D4D Technologies, LLC (“D4D”).  Since that date, we have accounted for our equity interest in D4D under the equity method of accounting.

On August 3, 2009, we entered into an amendment whereby we paid certain of D4D’s members approximately $8.0 million.  Such payment is included in Investments and other in our consolidated financial statements and is being amortized over a period of 15 years.  On September 30, 2013, we purchased additional equity in D4D, increasing our ownership to 21.4%.

Note 10 – Plans of Restructuring

During the year ended December 29, 2012, we incurred restructuring costs of approximately $15.2 million (approximately $10.5 million after taxes) consisting of employee severance pay and benefits related to the elimination of approximately 200 positions; facility closing costs, representing primarily lease terminations and property and equipment write-off costs; and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan.  This restructuring program is complete and we do not expect any additional costs from this program.

The costs associated with this restructuring are included in a separate line item, “Restructuring costs” within our consolidated statements of income.

The following table shows the amounts expensed and paid for restructuring costs that were incurred during our 2013, 2012 and 2011 fiscal years and the remaining accrued balance of restructuring costs as of December 28, 2013, which is included in Accrued expenses: Other and Other liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet:

Note 11 – Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Our diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to basic earnings per share, except that it reflects the effect of common shares issuable for presently unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units and upon exercise of stock options, using the treasury stock method in periods in which they have a dilutive effect.

A reconciliation of shares used in calculating earnings per basic and diluted share follows:

Weighted-average options to purchase 8 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $69.45 per share that were outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2011 were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the average market price of our common stock during the year, thereby causing the effect of such options to be anti-dilutive.

of such valuation allowances will be reflected as a reduction of income tax expense in accordance with the provisions of

ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations.”

The assessment of the amount of value assigned to our deferred tax assets under the applicable accounting rules is judgmental.  We are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating the likelihood that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future.  Such evidence includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent operations.  Since this evaluation requires consideration of events that may occur some years into the future, there is an element of judgment involved.  Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods.  We believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow us to recover substantially all of the value assigned to our deferred tax assets.  However, if future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover all of the value assigned to our deferred tax assets, we will be required to adjust our valuation allowance accordingly.

For the year ended December 28, 2013, our effective tax rate was 28.7% compared to 31.1% for the prior year period.  During the third quarter of 2013, we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the United States, which had been previously reserved, will be realized.  As a result, our provision for income taxes includes a $13.4 million reduction of the valuation allowance which is based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards.

Absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 28, 2013 would have been 30.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 28.7%.  The remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been, and will continue to be reinvested.  These earnings could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate, or if we should sell, transfer or dispose of our stock in the foreign subsidiaries.  It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be payable on the foreign earnings because if we were to repatriate these earnings, we believe there would be various methods available to us, each with different U.S. tax consequences.  As of December 28, 2013, the cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was approximately $694.2 million.

ASC Topic 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with other provisions contained within this guidance.  This topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement.  In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities.  Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect to certain tax matters.

Note 12 – Income Taxes – (Continued)

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2013 was approximately $54.1 million, of which $40.3 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.  It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect the change to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The total amounts of interest and penalties, which are classified as a component of the provision for income taxes, were approximately $10.9 million and $0, respectively, as of December 28, 2013.

The tax years subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions include the years 2009 and forward by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the years 2000 and forward for certain states and the years 2005 and forward for certain foreign jurisdictions.

Note 13 – Concentrations of Risk

Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk.  These financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments.  In all cases, our maximum exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments.  We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have been within our expectations.  We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable.

We limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative instruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counter-parties to such financial instruments.  As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties.

With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively large customer base and its dispersion across different types of health care professionals and geographic areas.  No single customer accounted for more than 0.8% of our net sales in 2013.  With respect to our sources of supply, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 37% and 8%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2013.

Our long-term notes receivable primarily represent strategic financing arrangements with certain industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses.  Generally, these notes are secured by certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other commercial financial institutions.  While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and operational performance.

Note 14 –

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.  We attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.  These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.  Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets.  All foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure.  We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital.

Fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.  Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings.  We purchase short-term (i.e., 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to our foreign suppliers.  We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.  Our hedging activities have historically not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, additional disclosures related to derivatives and hedging activities required by ASC Topic 815 have been omitted.

Segment

and Geographic Data

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: health care distribution and technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.  The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments.  This segment consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.

Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.  Our global dental, animal health and medical groups serve practitioners in 25 countries worldwide.

Our global technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services and continuing education services for practitioners.

Beginning with the first quarter of 2012, we have reported net sales and prior-year sales comparisons for each of our global dental, animal health and medical and global technology and value-added services business groups.

This sales reporting is consistent with our global business groups as realigned in 2012.  These groups have been formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective, as well as global product and service offerings and best practices.

We will continue to report financial results for our health care distribution and technology and value-added services reportable segments.  The health care distribution segment comprises three global operating segments (dental, animal health and medical) and the technology and value-added services segment remains unchanged.

In connection with this change in business groups, goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units.  We reviewed the newly allocated goodwill and determined that there was no impairment.

Note 16 – Employee Benefit Plans

Stock-based Compensation

Our accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect pre-tax share-based compensation expense of $35.5 million ($24.6 million after-tax), $37.3 million ($25.7 million after-tax) and $36.9 million ($25.2 million after-tax) for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows present our stock-based compensation expense as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented.  In the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, we presented $8.1 million, $17.8 million and $8.8 million of benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation as a cash inflow from financing activities for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors.  We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Our stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.

Stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the terms of our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and our 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (together, the “Plans”).  The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Prior to March 2009, awards under the Plans principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock (including restricted stock units).  Since March 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units, with the exception of stock options for certain pre-existing contractual obligations.  As of December 28, 2013, there were 31,229 shares authorized and 6,583 shares available to be granted under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 800 shares authorized and 93 shares available to be granted under the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed price.  Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to our closing stock price on the date of grant.  These awards, which generally vest 25% per year based on the recipient’s continued service subject to the terms and conditions of the Plans, are fully vested four years from the grant date and have a contractual term of ten years from the grant date.  Additionally, recipients may not sell any shares that they acquire through exercising their stock options until the third anniversary of the date of grant of such options.  We estimated the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Note 16 – Employee Benefit Plans – (Continued)

Grants of restricted stock are common stock awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.  We issue restricted stock that vests solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting) and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting).

With respect to time-based restricted stock, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  With respect to performance-based restricted stock, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a three-year period as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock based on our closing stock price at time of grant.

The Plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock targets for significant events such as acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures and share repurchases.  Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  The ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the Plans.

Restricted stock units are awards that we grant to certain employees that entitle the recipient to shares of common stock upon vesting.  We grant restricted stock units with the same time-based and performance-based vesting that we use for restricted stock.  The fair value of restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant, based on our closing stock price.

We record deferred income tax assets for awards that will result in future deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction.  Differences between the deferred income tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax return are recorded in additional paid-in capital (if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred income tax asset) or in earnings (if the deferred income tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid-in capital exists from previous awards).

Stock-based compensation grants for the three years ended December 28, 2013 primarily consisted of restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants.  Certain stock-based compensation granted may require us to settle in the form of a cash payment.  During the year ended December 28, 2013, we recorded a liability of $0.5 million relating to the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation to be settled in cash, as well as an expense of $0.6 million relating to the change in the fair value of these grants.  The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-based awards granted before forfeitures was $89.97, $73.42 and $68.25 per share during the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards as of December 28, 2013 was $69.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years.

Expected life of options (years)

4.75

During the years ended December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, we did not grant any stock options.

We have not declared cash or stock dividends on our stock in the past and we do not anticipate declaring cash or stock dividends in the foreseeable future.  The expected stock price volatility was based on the evaluation of implied volatilities from traded call options on our stock and from call options embedded in our convertible debt, historical volatility of our stock and other factors.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant in conjunction with considering the expected life of options.  The expected life of options represented the approximate period of time that granted options were expected to be outstanding and was based on historical data, including, among other things, option exercises, forfeitures and cancellations.  Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by recipients of stock options, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us.

The total cash received as a result of stock option exercises for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was approximately $35.6 million, $72.5 million and $34.5 million.  In connection with these exercises, the tax benefits that we realized for the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were $18.4 million, $31.6 million and $7.2 million.  We settle employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares.

The total intrinsic value per share of restricted stock (including restricted stock units) that vested was $98.99, $75.98 and $66.78 during the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  The following table summarizes the status of our non-vested restricted shares/units for the year ended December 28, 2013:

401(k) Plans

We offer qualified 401(k) plans to substantially all our domestic full-time employees.  As determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans generally do not exceed 100% of the participants’ contributions up to 7% of their base compensation, subject to applicable legal limits.  Matching contributions consist of cash and were allocated entirely to the participants’ investment elections on file, subject to a 20% allocation limit to the Henry Schein Stock Fund.  Forfeitures attributable to participants whose employment terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to reduce our matching contributions and offset administrative expenses of the 401(k) plans.

Assets of the 401(k) and other defined contribution plans are held in self-directed accounts enabling participants to choose from various investment fund options.  Matching contributions and administrative expenses related to these plans charged to operations during the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 amounted to $25.3 million, $23.8 million and $23.0 million.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan to eligible employees.  This plan generally covers officers and certain highly-compensated employees after they have reached the maximum IRS allowed pre-tax 401(k) contribution limit.  Our contributions to this plan are equal to the 401(k) employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base compensation for the portion of the year in which such employees are not eligible to make pre-tax contributions to the 401(k) plan.  The amounts charged to operations during the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 amounted to $4.1 million, $2.1 million and $0.7 million.

Deferred Compensation Plan

During 2011, we began to offer a deferred compensation plan to a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company and certain associated companies. This plan allows for the elective deferral of base salary, bonus and/or commission compensation by eligible employees.  The amounts charged to operations during the years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 were approximately $1.1 million, $0.3 million and $0, respectively.

Litigation

From time to time, we may become a party to legal proceedings, including, without limitation, product liability claims, employment matters, commercial disputes, governmental inquiries and investigations, and other matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  In our opinion, pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

As of December 28, 2013, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss.  This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other external factors, including probable recoveries from third parties.

Employment, Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements

We have definite-lived employment, consulting and non-compete agreements that have varying base aggregate annual payments for the years 2014 through 2018 and thereafter of approximately $13.0 million, $2.7 million, $2.1 million, $2.5 million, $0.2 million and $2.2 million.  We also have lifetime consulting agreements that provide for current compensation of $0.5 million per year, increasing $25 every fifth year with the next increase in 2017.  In addition, some agreements have provisions for additional incentives and compensation.

Note 18 – Quarterly Information (Unaudited) – (Continued)

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results also may be adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:

•  timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•  timing of pricing changes offered by our vendors;

•  timing of the introduction of new products and services by our vendors;

•  timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;

•  changes in or availability of vendor contracts or rebate programs;

•  vendor rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;

•  changes in the way vendors introduce or deliver products to market;

•  costs of developing new applications and services;

•  our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;

•  exclusivity requirements with certain vendors may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other vendors;

•  loss of sales representatives;

•  costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

•  costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;

•  general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;

•  our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;

•  unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;

•  product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;

•  exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;

•  increases in the cost of shipping or service issues with our third-party shippers;

•  restructuring costs; and

•  changes in accounting principles.

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate.  If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.

ITEM 9A.  Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 28, 2013 to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 28, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework. Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 28, 2013.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013 has been independently audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their attestation is included herein.

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited Henry Schein, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Henry Schein, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Henry Schein, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2013 and our report dated February 11, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
