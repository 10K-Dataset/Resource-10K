PART I

ITEM 1. Business

General

We are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office-based
healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. We serve more than
475,000 customers worldwide, including dental practices and laboratories, physician practices and
veterinary clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We believe that we have a strong
brand identity due to our more than 72 years of experience distributing healthcare products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ nearly 10,000 people and have operations in
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria,
Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Australia and New
Zealand. We also have affiliates in Iceland and Israel.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve
our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad
product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service,
enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also
allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two segments: healthcare distribution and technology. These
segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The healthcare
distribution segment consists of our dental, medical (including veterinary) and international
groups. Products distributed consist of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products,
large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products,
diagnostic tests, infection control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves approximately 80% of the estimated 135,000 office-based dental
practices in the combined United States and Canadian dental market. Based upon an estimated $4.7
billion combined United States and Canadian dental market, we estimate our share of this market was
approximately 34% in 2004.

Our medical group serves approximately 50% of the estimated 250,000 office-based physician
practices, as well as surgical centers and other alternate-care settings throughout the United
States. We also serve over 70% of the estimated 27,000 veterinarian clinics in the United States.
Based upon an estimated $7.4 billion combined market, we estimate our share of this market was
approximately 19% in 2004.

Our international group serves approximately 210,000 practices in 17 countries outside of
North America and is what we believe to be a leading Pan-European healthcare supplier serving
office-based dental, medical, and veterinary practices. Based upon an estimated $7.4 billion
Western and Central European combined dental, medical and veterinary market in which we operate, we
estimate our share of this market was approximately 12% in 2004.

Our technology group provides software, technology, and other value-added services to
healthcare providers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice
solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and
veterinary clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing
education services for practitioners.



Industry

The healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to office-based healthcare
practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental,
medical and veterinary markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $19.5 billion in
2004 in the combined North American and Western and Central European markets. The industry ranges
from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service
organizations comprising anywhere from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who
have combined or otherwise associated their practices.

Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage
large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small
equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by
frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order
fulfillment. The purchasing decisions within an office-based healthcare practice are typically
made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant, and supplies and small equipment are
generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one distributor generally serving as the
primary supplier.

The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging
population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing,
new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage. In addition, the
physician market continues to benefit from procedures and diagnostic testing shifting from
hospitals to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices. As the cosmetic surgery and
elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are increasingly performing more of these
procedures in their offices.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of
distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine
with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth. This consolidation may also
continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current
product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Competition

The distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive.
Many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number
of suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to
market particular products. Manufacturers could also seek to sell directly to end-users, and
thereby eliminate or reduce the role of distributors, like us.

In the United States, we compete with other distributors, as well as several major
manufacturers of dental, medical and veterinary products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth
of product line, customer service and value-added products and services. In the sale of our dental
products, our principal national competitor is Patterson Companies, Inc. (formerly Patterson Dental
Company). In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a
national, regional and local level. Our principal competitors in the sale of medical products are
PSS World Medical, Inc., the General Medical division of McKesson Corp. and the Allegiance division
of Cardinal Health, Inc., which are national distributors. In the veterinary market, our two
principal national competitors include The Butler Company and Burns Veterinary Supply, Inc. We
also compete against a number of regional and local medical and veterinary distributors, as well as
a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians and veterinarians. With regard to our
practice management software, we compete against numerous other firms, including firms such as
PracticeWorks, Inc., a subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company, which primarily targets dental
practices, and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., which serves veterinary practices. We compete in Canada
substantially on the same basis as in the United States.



We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price
and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG &
Co., Planmeca Oy, Omega Pharma NV and Bilricay, as well as a large number of dental product
distributors and manufacturers in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France,
Austria, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.

Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our
prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect operating results.

Competitive Strengths

We have more than 72 years of experience in distributing products to healthcare practitioners
resulting in strong awareness of the “Henry Schein” name. Our competitive strengths include:

Direct sales and marketing expertise

. Our sales and marketing efforts are
designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal
visits by field sales representatives and frequent direct marketing contact,
emphasizing our broad product lines, competitive prices and ease of order
placement. The key elements of our direct sales and marketing efforts are:

•

Field sales consultants

. We have approximately 2,000 field sales
consultants, including equipment sales specialists, covering major
North American and international markets. These consultants
complement our direct marketing and telesales efforts and enable us to
better market, service and support the sale of more sophisticated
products and equipment.

•

Direct marketing

. During 2004, we distributed more than 34 million
pieces of direct marketing material, including catalogs, flyers, order
stuffers and other promotional materials to existing and potential
office-based healthcare customers.

•

Telesales

. We support our direct marketing effort with approximately
1,200 inbound and outbound telesales representatives, who facilitate
order processing and generate new sales through direct and frequent
contact with customers.

Broad product and service offerings at competitive prices

. We offer a broad
range of products and services to our customers, at competitive prices, in the
following categories:

•

Consumable supplies and equipment

. We offer approximately 160,000
SKUs (including items not typically stocked) to our customers in North
America. Of the SKUs offered in North America, approximately 70,000
are offered to our dental customers, approximately 90,000 to our
medical customers and approximately 40,000 to our veterinary
customers. We offer approximately 110,000 SKUs (including items not typically stocked) to our customers outside of North America.

•

Technology and other value-added products and services

. We sell
practice management software systems to our dental, medical and
veterinary customers. Our practice management software products
provide practitioners with patient treatment history, billing,
accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars,
electronic claims processing and word processing programs. As of
December 25, 2004, more than 50,000 of our Dentrix®, Easy Dental® and
our AVImark® (veterinary) software systems have been installed.

•

Repair services

. We have 158 equipment sales and service centers
worldwide that provide a variety of repair services for our healthcare
customers. Our technicians provide installation and repair services
for dental handpieces; dental, medical and veterinary small equipment;
table top sterilizers; and large equipment.



•

Financial services

. We offer our customers assistance in operating
their practices by providing access to a number of financial services
and products at rates that we believe are generally lower than what
they would be able to secure independently.

Commitment to superior customer service

. We maintain a strong commitment to
providing superior customer service. We frequently monitor our customer service
through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical reports. Our customer
service policy primarily focuses on:

•

Exceptional order fulfillment

. We estimate that approximately 99% of
items ordered in the United States and Canada are shipped without back
ordering and are shipped on the same business day the order is
received.

•

Streamlined ordering process

. Customers may place orders 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week (“24/7”) by mail, fax, telephone, e-mail and by
using our computerized order entry systems, our 24/7 automated phone
service and our Internet sites.

Integrated management information systems

. Our information systems generally
allow for centralized management of key functions, including accounts
receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales, and order
fulfillment. These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior
customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and
monitor daily operational statistics.

Effective purchasing

. We believe that effective purchasing is a key element to
maintaining and enhancing our position as a low-cost provider of healthcare
products. We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’
offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the best possible cost. In
2004, our top 10 healthcare distribution vendors and our single largest vendor
accounted for approximately 26% and 5% of our aggregate purchases.

Efficient distribution

. We distribute our products from our strategically
located distribution centers. We maintain optimal inventory levels in order to
satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment.
These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our
management information systems. Once an order is entered, it is electronically
transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s location and a
packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to continue to expand as a value-added distributor of healthcare products and
services to office-based healthcare practitioners. To accomplish this, we will apply our
competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:

•

Increase penetration of our existing customer base

. We intend to
increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position
as their primary vendor. In the North American dental market, total
consumable sales per practitioner are estimated to be approximately
$25,000, of which our average dental customer’s sales are
approximately $8,500 (or 34%) of those sales. In the U.S. medical
market, total sales per practitioner are estimated to be approximately
$12,000, of which our average U.S. medical customer’s sales are
approximately $4,000 (or 33%) of those sales. In the Western and
Central European dental market, total sales per practitioner are
estimated to be approximately $26,000, of which our average Western
and Central European dental customer’s sales are approximately $7,500
(or 29%) of those sales.

•

Increase the number of customers we serve

. This strategy includes
increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as
well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts.



•

Leverage our value-added products and services

. We intend to increase
cross-selling efforts for key product lines. In the dental business,
we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental
practice management software users and our dental distribution
customers. In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand
our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to medical
distribution customers, as well as cross-selling core products with
these key products.

•

Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures

. Since the beginning
of 1999, we have acquired more than 25 companies engaged in businesses
that are complementary to ours. Our acquisition strategy includes
acquiring entities that will provide additional sales that will be
channeled through our existing infrastructure, acquiring access to
additional product lines, acquiring regional distributors with
networks of field sales consultants and expanding internationally.

Markets Served

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is
increasingly using healthcare services. Between 2003 and 2010, the 45 and older population is
expected to grow by approximately 16% and between 2003 and 2020, the 45 and older population is
expected to grow by approximately 32%. This compares with expected total U.S. population growth
rates of 7% between 2003 and 2010 and 16% between 2003 and 2020.

In the dental industry, there is predicted to be an attendant rise in oral healthcare
expenditures as this segment of the population increases. Cosmetic dentistry is another growing
aspect of dental practices as new technologies allow dentists to offer cosmetic solutions patients
seek. At the same time, there is an increase in dental insurance coverage. Approximately 57% of
the U.S. population now has some form of dental coverage, up from 47% in 1995.

We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs we offer, as well as through
important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims
processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a
practitioner’s efficiency and profitability.

We believe our medical group is the fastest growing distributor among the major competitors in
the physician and alternate-care markets. There continues to be a migration of procedures from
acute-care settings to physicians’ offices, a trend that may provide additional opportunity for us.
There is also the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in
alternate-care settings. We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier
to the office-based medical practitioner.

We believe our international group is a leading Pan-European healthcare supplier servicing
office-based dental and medical practices. We are in the process of attempting to replicate our
U.S. infrastructure in Europe. Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model
throughout Europe and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist. Through our
“Schein Direct” program, we can provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in 125
countries around the world.

On June 18, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of Demedis GmbH (excluding
its Austrian operations), which we believe to be a leading full-service distributor of dental
consumables and equipment in Germany, Austria, and the Benelux countries; and Euro Dental Holding
GmbH, which included KRUGG S.p.A., Italy’s leading distributor of dental consumable products, and
DentalMV GmbH (otherwise known as Muller & Weygandt, or “M&W”). We refer to these entities
collectively as the “Demedis Group.”

As part of our agreement with the German regulatory authorities, we agreed to divest M&W
shortly after the consummation of the acquisition effected through exercising a put option back to
the previous owners. On July 16, 2004, this divestiture was completed for EUR 50.0 million (or
$62.2 million), including the



assumption of debt of approximately EUR 27.5 million (or $34.2 million), resulting in a
reduction of the purchase price for the Demedis Group.

As part of the agreement to divest M&W, we were entitled to receive 50% of the net sale
proceeds in excess of EUR 55.0 million in the event M&W was subsequently resold before June 18,
2005. On September 24, 2004, an agreement was signed to resell M&W for an amount that resulted in
our realizing a share of the net sales proceeds equal to EUR 26.4 million (or $32.4 million), which
we received in October 2004. This amount was treated as a further reduction of the purchase price
for the Demedis Group.

The regulatory authorities are continuing their review of our pending acquisition of the
Demedis Group’s business in Austria, which operates under the Austrodent brand. Of the total
purchase price for the Demedis Group, EUR 11.0 million (or $13.5 million) was attributable to
Austrodent, which was included in other current assets as of December 25, 2004. In the event that
we receive regulatory approval to acquire Austrodent, this amount will be reclassified based on the
fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired through a purchase price allocation, with an
increase to goodwill for any excess of purchase price over fair value. In the event that we do not
receive regulatory approval to acquire Austrodent, we are entitled to receive the proceeds through
a sale of Austrodent, net of selling costs, up to EUR 11.0 million. Any shortfall between the EUR
11.0 million and the proceeds received upon a subsequent sale of Austrodent will be recorded as an
addition to goodwill of the Demedis Group.

We financed the acquisition of the Demedis Group primarily with cash on hand, with borrowings
under our existing revolving credit facility and with proceeds from a bridge loan in the amount of
$150.0 million. These borrowings were repaid in full with the net proceeds from the issuance of
$240.0 million of long-term convertible debt on August 9, 2004.

The operating results of the Demedis Group, including M&W (which was accounted for using the
equity method through the date of the divestiture) and excluding Austrodent, are included in the
accompanying financial statements since the acquisition date of June 18, 2004.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed
the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of
seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products); purchasing
patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners; and year-end promotions. Net sales and
operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales
in the prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other
factors, including:



Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our
stock price may decline.

E-Commerce

Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by
electronic on-line commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid
technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of on-line commerce will
require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to
develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our
customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.

Through our proprietary technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety
of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, coupled with our
name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, positions us well
to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways
and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities.

Governmental Regulations

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and foreign
governmental laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals
and medical devices. Among the federal laws applicable to us are the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and the Controlled Substances Act.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally regulates the introduction, manufacture,
advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, marketing and distribution of, and record
keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce.

The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, establishes certain requirements applicable to the wholesale distribution of
prescription drugs, including the requirement that wholesale drug distributors be registered with
the Secretary of Health and Human Services and be licensed by each state in which they conduct
business in accordance with federally established guidelines on storage, handling and record
maintenance.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are
required to obtain a registration annually from the Attorney General in accordance with specified
rules and regulations and are subject to inspection by the Drug Enforcement Administration acting
on behalf of the Attorney General. We are required to maintain licenses and permits for the
distribution of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under the laws of the states in which
we operate. In addition, our dentist and physician customers are subject to significant
governmental regulation. There can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or
customers’ practices will not have a material adverse impact on our business.

We believe that we are in compliance with the foregoing laws and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our
business.



Proprietary Rights

We hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein” name and logo, as well as certain other
trademarks. Pursuant to agreements executed in connection with our reorganization in 1994, both
Henry Schein, Inc., and Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. (which was acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. in 2000), a company engaged in the manufacture and distribution of multi-source pharmaceutical
products, are entitled to use the “Schein” name in connection with their respective businesses, but
Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. is not entitled to use the name “Henry Schein”. We intend to protect
our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.

Employees

As of December 25, 2004, we had approximately 9,600 full-time employees, including
approximately 1,200 telesales representatives, 2,000 field sales consultants, including equipment
sales specialists, 1,625 warehouse employees, 375 computer programmers and technicians, 925
management employees and 3,475 office, clerical and administrative employees. Approximately 310 or
3% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our
relations with our employees are good.

We are subletting 66,500 square feet of this facility through July 2007.

The properties listed in the table above are our principal properties primarily used in
our healthcare distribution segment. We also lease distribution, office, showroom and sales space
in other locations including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Australia and New
Zealand.

We believe that our properties are in good condition, are well maintained and are suitable and
adequate to carry on our business. We have additional operating capacity at certain distribution
center facilities.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

Our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary
course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally
obtain product indemnification from our suppliers for manufactured products.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in
amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate
amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate
protection. In our opinion, all pending matters, including those described below, are covered by
insurance or will not otherwise seriously harm our financial condition.

As of December 25, 2004, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability, class action and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and
for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related
expenses, was not material to our



financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for determining estimated
losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other
external factors, including probable recoveries from third parties. In addition, we believe that
no amount of losses in excess of this accrued amount were reasonably estimable or reasonably
possible to result in a liability.

Product Liability Claims

As of December 25, 2004, we were a defendant in approximately 38 product liability cases. Of
these cases, three involve claims made by healthcare workers and/or their families who claim
allergic reaction relating to exposure to latex gloves. In each of these cases, we acted as a
distributor of brand name and/or “Henry Schein” private brand latex gloves, which were manufactured
by third parties. To date, discovery in these cases has generally been limited to product
identification issues. The manufacturers in these cases generally withhold indemnification of us
pending product identification; however, we have impleaded or filed cross claims against those
manufacturers in such cases.

Texas Class Action

On January 27, 1998, in District Court in Travis County, Texas, we and one of our subsidiaries
were named as defendants in a matter entitled “Shelly E. Stromboe and Jeanne Taylor, on Behalf of
Themselves and all others Similarly Situated vs. Henry Schein, Inc., Easy Dental Systems, Inc. and
Dentisoft, Inc.,” Case No. 98-00886. The petition alleges, among other things, negligence, breach
of contract, fraud, and violations of certain Texas commercial statutes involving the sale of
certain practice management software products sold prior to 1998 under the Easy Dental® name.

In October 1999, the trial court, on motion, certified both a Windows® sub-class and a DOS
sub-class to proceed as a class action pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 42. On October 31, 2002, the
Texas Supreme Court, on appeal, found that the trial court’s certification of the case as a class
action was improper. The Texas Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for further
proceedings consistent with its opinion.

The trial court ruled in our favor on remand. As a result, only certain individual claims
asserted on behalf of the named plaintiffs remained pending in the
case as of the end of 2004. Such claims were resolved in January 2005.

Purported Class Action in New Jersey

In February 2002, we were served with a summons and complaint in an action commenced in the
Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County, entitled “West Morris Pediatrics, P.A.
and Avenel-Iselin Medical Group, P.A. vs. Henry Schein, Inc., doing business as Caligor,” Case No.
MRS-L-421-02. The plaintiffs’ complaint purported to be on behalf of a nationwide class of all
physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers throughout New Jersey and across the United
States. The complaint, as amended in August 2002, alleged breach of oral contract, breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act,
unjust enrichment, conversion and promissory estoppel relating to sales of a vaccine product in the
year 2001. In September 2004, the court denied class certification. As a result, only certain
individual claims asserted on behalf of the two named plaintiffs remained pending in the case as of
the end of 2004. Such claims were settled in January 2005.

(2)

On March 12, 2003, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of
up to four million shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 4.5% of shares
outstanding on the announcement date. Through the close of the second quarter of 2004, we had
completed the repurchase of the entire four million shares under this initiative.

(3)

On June 21, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a second share
repurchase program. The new program allows us to repurchase up to $100 million in shares of
our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5% of shares outstanding on the
announcement date. Through the close of the fourth quarter of 2004, we had repurchased
1,168,810 shares under this initiative. The maximum number of shares that may yet be
purchased under this program is determined at the end of each month based on the then closing
price of our stock.

Dividend Policy

We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock during fiscal years 2004 or 2003.
We currently do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future. We intend to retain earnings to finance the expansion of our business and for general
corporate purposes, including our stock repurchase programs. Any declaration of dividends will be
at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition,
capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of
dividends and other factors. Our revolving credit agreement, as well as the agreements governing
our senior notes, limits the distribution of dividends without the prior written consent of the
lenders. Additionally, we are restricted as to the amounts of annual dividends
(limited to the greater of $25.0 million or 40% of net income.)

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

In accordance with the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, we provide the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors which, among
others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements,
expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. All forward-looking statements made by
us are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. These
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. These statements are identified by the use of such terms as “may,”
“could,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate” or
other comparable terms.

Risk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
current and historical results include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; changes in the
healthcare industry; changes in government regulations that affect us; financial risks associated
with our international operations; fluctuations in quarterly earnings; transitional challenges
associated with acquisitions; regulatory and litigation risks; the dependence on our continued
product development, technical support and successful marketing in the technology segment; our
dependence upon sales personnel and key customers; our dependence on our senior management; our
dependence on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products; possible increases in
the cost of shipping our products or other service trouble with our third-party shippers; risks
from rapid technological change; and risks from potential increases in variable interest rates.
The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative
importance or priority.

We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these
factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements
should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no duty and have no
obligation to update forward-looking statements.

Recent Developments

On October 5, 2004, Chiron Corporation announced that it would not supply Fluvirin® influenza
vaccine to the U.S. market for the current influenza season as a result of action by the U.K.
regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), to temporarily
suspend its license to manufacture Fluvirin® influenza vaccine in Chiron’s Liverpool, U.K.
facility. On October 15, 2004, based on the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration’s (FDA) evaluation and inspection of
Chiron’s Liverpool, U.K. manufacturing facility, the FDA announced that none of the influenza vaccine manufactured by Chiron for the U.S.
Market was safe for use. We are the primary distributor of Fluvirin® to the U.S. market and Chiron is currently
our primary supplier of the influenza vaccine.

On
December 2, 2004, we entered into a multi-year agreement terminating in 2014
with ID Biomedical Corporation to distribute ID Biomedical’s
Fluviral® influenza vaccine.
The agreement will commence upon approval of Fluviral® by the FDA, which could be as early as 2005 if the FDA provides expedited approval of the ID Biomedical application, and will
terminate in 2014.  Once Fluviral® is approved by the FDA, ID Biomedical plans to manufacture
up to an estimated 15 million doses for the U.S. market in 2005, and increase production to
approximately 38 million doses by 2007.  Similarly, we will increase the number of Fluviral®
doses we purchase over that time, and by 2007 will have approximately 19 million doses per year
available for distribution to our customers.

On
March 2, 2005, Chiron announced that it received notice from the
MHRA that the agency
has lifted the license suspension for Chiron’s Liverpool, U.K. manufacturing facility. The
 decision is conditioned on the understanding that Chiron’s level of commitment to the completion
 of its remediation plan and ongoing improvements must continue. Chiron is required to provide the MHRA
with regular weekly updates to ensure that progress on its various
projects proceeds satisfactorily and
the MHRA may conduct further inspections.

On
March 2, 2005, the FDA announced that it has been working closely with the MHRA,
 including during inspections, as the agency evaluates Chiron’s progress in correcting their
manufacturing problems. The FDA plans to conduct a comprehensive inspection of Chiron’s Liverpool,
 U.K. manufacturing facility to ensure that Chiron can produce a safe and effective vaccine once
all critical stages of manufacturing are fully operational and needed corrective actions can be fully
 evaluated.

Given the significant uncertainty about
whether Fluvirin® will be available for the 2005/2006 influenza season, in the fourth quarter of
2004, we recorded a pre-tax one-time charge of approximately $13.2 million related to our Fluvirin®
contract. This charge represented the write-off of a deferred expense associated with the
2005/2006 influenza season.

Executive-Level Overview

We are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office-based
healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. We serve more than
475,000 customers worldwide, including dental practices and laboratories, physician practices and
veterinary clinics,



as well as government and other institutions. We believe that we have a strong brand identity
due to our more than 72 years of experience distributing healthcare products.

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ nearly 10,000 people and have operations in
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria,
Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Australia and New
Zealand. We also have affiliates in Iceland and Israel.

We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve
our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad
product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service,
enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also
allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

We conduct our business through two segments: healthcare distribution and technology. These
segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The healthcare
distribution segment consists of our dental, medical (including veterinary) and international
groups. Products distributed consist of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products,
large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products,
diagnostic tests, infection control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves office-based dental practices in the combined United States and
Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office-based physician practices, as well as
surgical centers and other alternate-care settings and veterinarian clinics throughout the United
States. Our international group serves practices in 17 countries outside of North America and is
what we believe to be a leading Pan-European healthcare supplier serving office-based dental,
medical and veterinary practices.

Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to
healthcare providers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice
solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and
veterinary clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing
education services for practitioners.

Industry Overview

In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment. This
trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low
prices. This trend has also accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care
accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products
at low prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information
support. We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably impact
demand for practice management systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and
facilitation of practice management.

Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and
transactions we undertook to expand our business, both domestically and internationally, in part,
to address significant changes in the healthcare industry, including consolidation of healthcare
distribution companies, potential healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare
and collective purchasing arrangements.

Industry Consolidation

The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based healthcare
practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental,
medical, and veterinary markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $19.5 billion
in 2004 in the combined North American and European markets. The industry ranges from sole
practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations
comprising anywhere from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined
or otherwise associated their practices.



Due in part to the inability of office-based healthcare practitioners to store and manage
large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small
equipment to office-based healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by
frequent, small-quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order
fulfillment. The purchasing decision within an office-based healthcare practice is typically made
by the practitioner or an administrative assistant, and supplies and small equipment are generally
purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of
distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine
with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth. This consolidation may also
continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current
product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products
and services to the healthcare industry. This trend has resulted in expansion into service areas,
which complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies
with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.

On June 18, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of the Demedis Group,
excluding its Austrian operations. This acquisition approximately doubled the net sales of our
international operations. Additionally,
since the beginning of 1999, we have completed more than 25 acquisitions.

As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this
trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing
infrastructure. In the U.S. dental market, we estimate that there are currently more than 300
smaller distributors holding approximately 40% of the market. In the U.S. medical market, we
estimate that more than 500 smaller distributors hold approximately 50% of the market, and in the
European dental market, we estimate that more than 200 competitors hold approximately 80% of the
market.

As the healthcare industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates
for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a
provider of products and services to the healthcare industry. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if
pursued. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur additional
merger and acquisition related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts
associated with any such transaction would be successful.

Aging Population and Other Market Influences

The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging
population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing,
new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage. In addition, the
physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing in
hospitals to the alternate-care site, particularly physicians’ offices. As the cosmetic surgery and
elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are increasingly performing more of these
procedures in their offices. The elder-care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth
rate of the population of elderly Americans.

The January 2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census estimates that the elderly population in America
will more than double by the year 2040. In 2000, four million Americans were age 85 years and
older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care services. By
the year 2040, that number is



projected to more than triple
to over 14 million. The population segment age 65 to 84 years is
projected to more than double in the same time period.

As a result of these market dynamics, the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue
to increase in the United States. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), Office of
the Actuary published “Health Spending Projections Through 2013” in 2004, indicating that total
national healthcare spending reached $1.6 trillion in 2002, or 14.9% of the nation’s gross domestic
product. Healthcare spending is projected to reach $3.4 trillion in 2013, an estimated 18.4% of
the gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in
the United States.

Governmental Influences

The healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation, licensure and operating
compliance procedures. National healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative
initiatives by Congress. Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large
portion of the total cost of medical care. The Balanced Budget Act passed by Congress in 1997
significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers,
affecting spending levels and overall financial viability of these institutions.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (the “Medicare Act”) is the
largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception and provides participants with
voluntary prescription drug benefits effective in 2006 with an interim drug discount card. The
Medicare Act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs, generic
substitution and provider reimbursement. Based upon current information, we believe the Medicare
Act may create additional volume demand and provide incentives for additional utilization of
generic drugs, both of which have potentially positive implications for the pharmaceutical
distribution portion of our business.

Product Integrity

Certain pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers are in discussions with
legislators about the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and manufacturers’ concerns
regarding the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting. As a distributor of such
products, we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with
counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation.

Reflects a $13.2 million pre-tax ($8.4 million post-tax) one-time charge, recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2004, related to our Fluvirin® contract with Chiron Corporation. This
charge, which represented the write-off of a deferred expense associated with the 2005/2006
influenza season, occurred as a result of the significant uncertainty about whether Chiron
will be able to provide Fluvirin® for the 2005/2006 influenza season. The effect that this
charge had on earnings per share for the year ended December 25, 2004 was $(0.10).

The $706.5 million, or 21.1%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 25, 2004
includes increases of 19.0% local currency growth (7.5% internally
generated primarily due to volume growth and 11.5% from
acquisitions, net of a divestiture) and 2.1% related to foreign currency exchange.

The $237.6 million, or 17.4%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 25,
2004 includes increases of 16.9% local currency growth (14.1%
internally generated primarily due to volume growth and 2.8% from
acquisitions) and 0.5% related to foreign currency exchange. The 16.9% local currency growth was
due to dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 16.0% (13.6% internal growth, of which 6.3%
related to sales of the Colgate and Pentron product lines) and dental equipment and service sales
growth of 20.1% (16.6% internal growth). We expect that the Colgate and Pentron product lines,
introduced through distribution agreements executed in 2004, will continue to contribute to our
overall increase in dental net sales.

The $108.0 million, or 8.1%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 25,
2004 includes increases of 1.0% internally generated and 7.1% from acquisitions (accounting for an increase of $96.8 million). Additionally, medical sales were affected by the absence of Fluvirin® influenza
vaccines in 2004, as previously discussed.

The $351.6 million, or 61.0%, increase in international net sales for the year ended December
25, 2004 includes increases of 50.0% in local currencies (43.5% from acquisitions, net of a
divestiture and 6.5% internally generated primarily due to volume growth) and 11.0% due to foreign currency exchange. The increase
was primarily due to our acquisition of the Demedis Group.

The $9.3 million, or 12.5%, increase in technology net sales for the year ended December 25,
2004 includes increases of 10.4% internal growth, 1.9% acquisition growth and 0.2% due to foreign
currency exchange. The increase was primarily due to growth of our value-added products, including
software products and related services.

Gross profit increased $149.2 million, or 16.1%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended December
25, 2004 compared to the prior year period. As a result of different practices of categorizing
costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not
necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies. Additionally, we realize substantially
higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution
segment. These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software
products combined with the nature of the software industry, in which developers realize higher
gross margins to recover investments in research and development.

Healthcare distribution gross profit increased $144.0 million, or 16.5%, to $1.0 billion for
the year ended December 25, 2004 compared to the prior year period. Healthcare distribution gross
profit margin decreased to 25.5% for the year ended December 25, 2004 from 26.5% for the comparable
prior year period, primarily due to the absence of Fluvirin® influenza vaccine in 2004 as
previously discussed.



Technology gross profit increased $5.2 million, or 9.2%, to $61.9 million for the year ended
December 25, 2004 compared to the prior year period. Technology gross profit margin decreased to
74.1% for the year ended December 25, 2004 from 76.3% for the comparable prior year period,
primarily due to changes in sales mix and increased investment in support services.

sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 21.3% from 20.7% for the
comparable prior year period. This increase of 0.6% was due to a $13.2 million charge related to
Fluvirin®, as previously discussed (which accounted for 0.4% of the increase) and the overall
growth in our business (which accounted for 0.2% of the increase).

As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, selling expenses
increased $95.8 million, or 21.9%, to $533.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2004 from
$437.5 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll
expenses as a percentage of our net sales. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses
increased to 13.1% from 13.0% for the comparable prior year period.

As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, general and
administrative expenses increased $74.0 million, or 28.9%, to $330.0 million for the year ended

Other expense, net increased $1.8 million to $9.7 million for the year ended December 25, 2004
from the comparable prior year period. The $712 thousand decrease in interest income was primarily
due to lower



invested surplus cash balances over the year. The $196 thousand decrease in interest expense
was primarily due to a $5.0 million decrease related to the effect of interest rate swaps entered
into during the fourth quarter of 2003, partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in interest
expense (of which $3.5 million related to our financing of the Demedis Group acquisition) due to
higher outstanding debt. Other, net decreased by $1.3 million,
primarily due to a $726 thousand non-recurring
real estate related gain and $517 thousand of foreign currency net
gains recognized in the prior year.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 25, 2004, our effective tax rate was 37.1% compared to 37.4% for
the prior year period. The difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory
rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes.

Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operation

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we recognized a $2.0 million loss, net of tax, on the
sale of a discontinued operation (See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).

Net Income

Net income decreased $9.3 million, or 6.8%, to $128.2 million for the year ended December 25,

Chiron Fluvirin® was included in 2004 net income. A post-tax real estate transaction gain of $454
thousand and a net loss on sale of a discontinued operation of $2.0 million are included in 2003
net income. The effect that such transactions had on earnings per share was $(0.10) in 2004 and
$(0.02) in 2003.

Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operation

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we recognized a $2.0 million loss, net of tax, on the
sale of a discontinued operation (See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).

Net Income

Net income increased $19.5 million, or 16.5%, to $137.5 million for the year ended December
27, 2003 compared to the prior year period. A post-tax real estate transaction gain of $454
thousand and a net loss on the sale of a discontinued operation of $2.0 million are included in
2003 net income. A post-tax real estate transaction gain of $890 thousand and a restructuring
accrual reversal of $734 thousand are included in 2002 net income. The effect that such
transactions had on earnings per share was $(0.02) in 2003 and $0.02 in 2002.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal capital requirements include the funding of acquisitions and repayments of debt
assumed in acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, working capital needs and capital
expenditures. Working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special
inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables. Because
sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy-in
opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year, our working capital requirements
have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the
following year.

We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit
facilities, private placement loans and stock issuances. Our principal sources of cash are from
our operations and short-term and long-term debt financings. Our ability to generate sufficient
cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for, and supply by
our vendors of, our products and services. Given current operating, economic and industry
conditions, we believe that demand for our products and services will
be consistent in the
foreseeable future.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $191.0 million for the year ended December
25, 2004 compared to $128.8 million for the prior-year period. This net change of $62.2 million
was due primarily to changes in the timing of cash receipts from customers and cash payments to
vendors (accounting for an increase of $52.8 million).

Net cash used in investing activities was $172.6 million for the year ended December 25, 2004
compared to $118.1 million for the prior year period. The net change of $54.5 million was
primarily due to payments for completed and pending business acquisitions, which accounted for
$31.6 million. The remaining change was primarily due to a decrease of $26.1 million related to
proceeds received from sales of marketable securities. We expect to invest approximately $50
million during fiscal year 2005 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and
computer systems infrastructure and to integrate certain operations.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $26.4 million for the year ended
December 25, 2004 compared to $(48.4) million for the prior-year period. The net change of $74.8
million was primarily due to our issuance of long-term debt (accounting for an increase of $234.2
million, net of issuance costs), partially offset by repayments of the debt assumed in business
acquisitions (accounting for a decrease of $135.7 million) and increased payments to repurchase our
common stock (accounting for a decrease of $20.5 million).

Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to
large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.
Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in
opportunities and our desired level of inventory.

Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 46.0 days as of December 25, 2004
from 46.4 days as of December 27, 2003. Our inventory turns remained constant at 6.9 turns for the
year ended December 25, 2004 compared to the prior year. We anticipate future increases in our
working capital requirements as a result of continued sales growth.

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate
long-term debt, including interest (assuming an average long-term variable rate of interest of
6.0%), as well as lease obligations and inventory purchase
commitments as of December 25, 2004.

As
previously discussed in the ‘Recent Developments’ section,
we have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from Chiron
Corporation and ID Biomedical Corporation. Given the uncertainties
surrounding the pending FDA approval for both companies to
distribute influenza vaccine in the U.S. for the 2005/2006 influenza
season, we have excluded these purchase obligations from the above
table.

Our
purchase commitment under our agreement with Chiron Corporation would
require us to pay $122.5 million in 2005 if they are able to
meet their obligations under the agreement. Our
purchase commitment under our agreement with ID Biomedical which
terminates in 2014 would
require us to pay an amount per dose based each year on the market price then prevailing. Under current market prices, this commitment would aggregate to approximately $45.0 million for
2005, increasing to approximately $113.0 million in 2007 and each
year thereafter.

On August 9, 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These
notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to
mature on August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each
year, which commenced on February 15, 2005. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a
conversion ratio of 21.58 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is
the equivalent conversion price of $46.34 per share. Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy
our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted, in
cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock. We currently have
sufficient availability of funds through our $200.0 million revolving credit facility along with
cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we issued $130.0
million and $100.0 million in senior notes. The $130.0 million notes come due on June 30, 2009 and
bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.94% per annum. Principal payments totaling $20.0 million are
due annually starting September 25, 2006 on the $100.0 million notes and bear interest at a fixed
rate of 6.66% per annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into agreements relating to the $230.0 million
senior notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. For the year ended
December 25, 2004, the weighted-average variable interest rate
was 5.05%. This weighted-average
variable interest rate comprises LIBOR, plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for the
senior notes.



We have a revolving credit facility of $200.0 million that is a four-year committed line
scheduled to expire in May 2006. We financed our acquisition of the Demedis Group with cash on
hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with proceeds from a bridge loan in the
amount of $150.0 million. These borrowings were repaid in full as of December 25, 2004 with the
net proceeds from our $240.0 million convertible debt issuance on August 9, 2004. As of December
25, 2004, there were $8.0 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings
outstanding under this revolving credit facility.

As of December 25, 2004, we had available various short-term bank credit lines of which $6.0
million was outstanding. Such credit lines bear interest at rates
ranging from 3.0% to 6.25%, and
were collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory and property and equipment with an aggregate
net carrying value of $25.3 million at December 25, 2004.

On June 21, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a second common
stock repurchase program. The new program allows us to repurchase up to $100 million in shares of
our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5% of shares outstanding on the announcement
date. As of December 25, 2004, we had repurchased $36.2 million or 1,168,810 shares under this
initiative.

Some holders of minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain
times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that approximates fair value pursuant to a
formula price as defined in the agreements. Additionally, some prior owners of such acquired
subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain
profitability targets are met. We have not accrued any liabilities that may arise from these
transactions because the outcome of the contingency is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.

We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months. Funding
requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which, on occasion,
may change. Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, ability to access public and private debt
markets and public equity markets, and available funds under existing credit facilities provide us
with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical data,
when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. However, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and
uncertainties. Reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions,
judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if
different assumptions were to be applied.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with our
audit committee, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our
financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and veterinary consumable products, as
well as dental equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for
discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded
based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are
recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped
to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of



the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed
and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are
reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is
completed at the time of delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which
the services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate
of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts
receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data,
experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may
adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect
collectibility. Although making changes to our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions would
affect our financial results, we believe the effect would not likely be material.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are
subject to annual impairment tests. Such impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value
and carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based
on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is
available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. Although
making changes to our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions would affect our financial results,
we believe the effect would not likely be material.

We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important, which could trigger an
interim impairment review, include:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business; and

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived
intangible assets have been impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement
of income. Based on our impairment review process, we have not recorded any material impairments
during 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily



consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names and customer relationships. When
an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value. We have not recorded any
material impairments during 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value-based method of
accounting prescribed by APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under this
method, no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than
the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date.

We make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method of accounting (the alternative method of accounting for stock-based compensation) had been
applied as required by FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” The fair
value-based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk-free interest rates,
stock price volatility, dividend yield and weighted-average option life. If different assumptions
were applied, the results would be different, however, such results would not affect our financial
statements as this is a disclosure-only requirement.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, in connection with our adoption of FAS 123(R)
(discussed below) stock-based compensation will be included in our results of operations. The
method and assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation under FAS
123(R) will be similar to those used under FAS 123. If different assumptions were applied, the
results would be different; however, we believe such results would not have a material effect on
our results of operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” This Statement
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs
liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This
Statement changes the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for
share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in FAS 123 as
originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.” This
Statement is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and applies to
all outstanding and unvested stock-based payment awards at the date of adoption. We anticipate the
adoption of FAS 123(R) will affect our results of operations to an extent similar to that as
presented in our FAS 123 pro forma disclosure included in the accompanying audited financial
statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4.” This Statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). This Statement requires that such items be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so
abnormal.” In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This
Statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. The provisions of FAS 151 must be applied prospectively. We do not anticipate the adoption
of FAS 151 to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 109-2 “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”),
provides guidance under FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” with respect to recording the
potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
“Jobs Act”) on enterprises’ income tax



expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2
states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to
evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign
earnings for purposes of applying FAS No. 109. We have not yet completed evaluating the impact of
the repatriation provisions. Accordingly, as provided for in FSP 109-2, we have not adjusted our
tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks, which include changes in interest rates, as well as changes in
foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other. We attempt to
minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap
contracts. These hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and
currency exchange risks. Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include
volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments. All
interest rate swap and currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and
are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and
currency exposure, not for speculation.

Interest Rate Swaps

We have fixed rate senior notes of $130.0 million at 6.94% and $100.0 million at 6.66%.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our
fixed interest rates for variable interest rates payable on the $230.0 million senior notes. The
variable rate is comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the
senior notes. As a result of these interest rate swap agreements, as well as our existing variable
rate credit lines and loan agreements, we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates. A
hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense
by approximately $2.8 million.

As of December 25, 2004, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other
non-current liabilities was $1.4 million, which represented the amount that would be paid upon
unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time. Changes in
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to non-current
assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the $230.0 million
notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective.

Foreign Exchange

The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may affect our
financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our
revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in
U.S. dollars. Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs, using primarily foreign
currency forward and swap contracts, aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on earnings. We purchase short-term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to
protect against currency exchange risks associated with long-term intercompany loans due from our
international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors. We do not
hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an
accounting not an economic exposure.



As of December 25, 2004, we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts
aggregating $447.2 million, of which $440.2 million related to intercompany debt and $7.0 million
related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors. The contracts hedge against currency
fluctuations of Euros ($371.5 million), British Pounds ($57.0 million), Australian Dollars ($11.1
million), Swedish Krona ($4.0 million), Swiss Francs ($2.8 million), Japanese Yen ($590.0 thousand)
and New Zealand Dollars ($265 thousand). As of December 25,
2004, the gross amount of these
contracts, calculated as the aggregate value of future U.S. dollar payments and receipts,
determined by quoted market prices, was $448.4 million. These contracts expire through June 2005.
For the year ended December 25, 2004, we recognized a loss relating to our foreign currency forward
and swap contracts of $892 thousand.

Risk Factors

The healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to
compete successfully.

We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.
Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow
them to compete more successfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our
customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive
rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers could
also increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and by-pass distributors like us.
Industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors, the unavailability of products,
whether due to our inability to gain access to products or interruptions in supply from
manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors could also increase competition. In the
future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues.

The healthcare industry is experiencing changes which could adversely affect our business.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and
regulatory influences. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change
driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including the reduction of spending budgets by
government and private insurance programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and corporate health
insurance plans; pressures relating to potential healthcare reform, trends toward managed care;
consolidation of healthcare distribution companies; collective purchasing arrangements among
office-based healthcare practitioners; and reimbursements to customers. If we are unable to react
effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry, our operating results could be
adversely affected. In addition, the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

We must comply with government regulations governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and
medical devices and additional regulations could negatively affect our business.

Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international
governmental laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals
and medical devices. Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled
Substances Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including the Prescription Drug
Marketing Act of 1987 and the Safe Medical Devices Act. Such laws:

•

regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, handling, record keeping, manufacturing and advertising of drugs and
medical devices;

•

subject us to inspection by the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration;

•

regulate the transportation of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;



•

require registration with the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration;

•

require us to coordinate returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall
procedures; and

•

impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.

Our business is also subject to requirements of foreign governmental laws and regulations
affecting our operations abroad.

The failure to comply with any of these regulations or the imposition of any additional
regulations could negatively affect our business. There can be no assurance that current or future
U.S. or foreign government regulations will not adversely affect our business.

Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which could adversely affect our
operating results.

International operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks that our international
operations are subject to include:

•

difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;

•

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;

•

repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;

•

cumbersome regulatory requirements;

•

unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;

•

imposition of import/export duties, quotas, sanctions or penalties; and

•

unexpected regulatory, economic and political changes in foreign markets.

As a result of our acquisition of the Demedis Group, our foreign operations are significantly
larger and, therefore, our exposure to the risks inherent in international operations has become
greater.

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the
expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of
seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing
patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end promotions. Net sales and operating
profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the
prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other
factors, including:



•

costs of developing new applications and services;

•

costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses;

•

the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•

general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries;

•

the timing of the release of functions of our technology-related products and services; and

•

our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships.

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet market expectations, our
stock price may decline.

Because we do not manufacture the products we distribute, we are dependent upon third parties for
the manufacture and supply of our products.

We obtain substantially all of our products from third-party suppliers. Generally, we do not
have long-term contracts with our suppliers, committing them to supply products to us. Therefore,
suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request. Because we do not
control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by
interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control. In the event that any of
our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in
required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely
basis. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on
a timely basis, if at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products, including the
supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product, would have an adverse
effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our
common stock.

Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves several risks.

We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint
ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the
future. Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible adverse effects on our
operating results or the market price of our common stock. Some of our acquisitions and future
acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy
certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations. In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:

•

may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;

•

requires significant management attention; and

•

may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources.

There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.
Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the
following:

•

the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;

•

our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to national or international
antitrust regulations; and

•

the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions.



We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use
of the products we sell results in injury.

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time we
are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other
healthcare products. Additionally, we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures
dental implants and we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims
relating to the manufacture of products by that entity. One of the potential risks we face in the
distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the
supply chain. In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered
hazardous materials. The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the
transportation of such materials could subject us to liability. We have insurance policies,
including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts we consider adequate.
Additionally, in many cases we are covered by indemnification from the manufacturer of the product.
However, we cannot assure you that the coverage maintained by us is sufficient to cover future
claims, that it will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that
indemnification agreements will provide adequate protection for us. A successful claim brought
against us in excess of available insurance or indemnification, or any claim that results in
significant adverse publicity against us, could harm our business.

Our technology segment depends upon continued product development, technical support and successful
marketing.

Competition among companies supplying practice management software is intense and increasing.
Our future sales of practice management software will depend on, among other factors:

•

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;

•

our ability to enhance our products; and

•

our ability to provide ongoing technical support.

We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software or
software enhancements, or that such software will be released on time or accepted by the market.
Our software products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when
introduced or as new versions are released. We cannot be sure that future problems with
post-release software errors or bugs will not occur. Any such defective software may result in
increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the
customers using such software. We do not have any patents on our software, and rely upon
copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections. We
cannot assure you that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our
software products.

Our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers,
vendors and manufacturers of the products we distribute.

Our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with
qualified sales personnel as well as key customers, vendors and manufacturers. If we fail to
maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such
key persons in the future, our business may suffer.

Our future performance is materially dependent upon our senior management.

Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our
existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
President, among others. The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse
effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman. We do not currently
have “key man” life insurance



policies on any of our employees. Competition for senior management is intense, and we may
not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.

Increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our third- party shippers could harm our
business.

Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our
U.S. orders by United Parcel Service, Inc. and other delivery services, and typically bear the cost
of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect
on our operating results. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers
could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on
a timely basis.

We may not be able to respond to technological change effectively.

Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by
electronic on-line commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid
technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of on-line commerce will
require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to
develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our
clients on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. Our inability to
anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our
business.

We are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange
our fixed rate interest rates for variable interest rates payable on our $230 million senior notes.
Our fixed interest rates on the senior notes were 6.94% and 6.66% for the $130 million and $100
million senior notes, respectively. The variable rate is comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and
resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes. As a result of these interest rate swap
agreements, as well as our existing variable rate credit lines, and loan agreements, we are exposed
to risk from fluctuations in interest rates. For example, a hypothetical 100 basis points increase
in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.8 million.

Our acquisition of the Demedis Group may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.

On June 18, 2004, we acquired the Demedis Group. We are in the process of integrating these
companies and assimilating the operations, services, products and personnel of each company with
our management policies, procedures and strategies. We cannot be sure that we will achieve the
benefits of revenue growth that we expect from this acquisition or that we will not incur
unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with this acquisition. To effectively manage
our expected future growth, we must continue to successfully manage our integration of the Demedis
Group and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, accounts receivable and
management, financial and operational controls. If we fail in any of these areas, our business
could be adversely affected.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a
significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including:

•

the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;

•

changes in our industry and competitors;

•

our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;



•

any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in
connection with business acquisitions and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;

•

general market and economic conditions; and

•

any outbreak or escalation of hostilities.

In addition, the Nasdaq National Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations
that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on
Nasdaq. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common
stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in
the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been
instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial
costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which would harm our business.

Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may
discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders
receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.

The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for
a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids, and may limit the price that certain
investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions,
among other things:

•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a
merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and

•

require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to:

•

remove a director; and

•

to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.

In addition, the Henry Schein, Inc. 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, the Henry Schein, Inc. 1996
Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan and the Henry Schein, Inc. 2001 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control, and
certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments
if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two years after a change in
control.

We also have a stockholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire us if our Board of Directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate
and in the stockholders’ best interest.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of
December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25,
2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Henry Schein, Inc. at December 25, 2004
and December 27, 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Henry Schein, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 25, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and
our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion.

HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

We distribute healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare
practitioners in the combined North American and European markets, with operations in the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Spain, the
Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand. We
also have affiliates in Iceland and Israel. We sell products and services to customers in dental
practices and dental laboratories, as well as physician practices, veterinary clinics, government
and other institutions.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of
our wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are
greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned, are accounted for under the
equity method. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fiscal Year

We report our operations and cash flows on a 52-53 week basis ending on the last Saturday of
December. Each of the three years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002
consisted of 52 weeks.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and veterinary consumable products, as
well as dental equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for
discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded
based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are
recognized.

Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped
to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the
product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and
product returns are reasonably estimable.

Revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1— Significant Accounting Policies— (Continued)

service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is completed at the
time of delivery.

Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which
the services are provided.

Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly-liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Book overdrafts of $32.7
million, representing outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit primarily related to
payments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 25, 2004.

Accounts Receivable and Reserves

The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects
our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The reserve for accounts receivable
is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. In addition to reviewing
delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our general allowance,
including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From
time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other
factors expected to affect collectibility.

Direct Shipping and Handling Costs

Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales. Direct handling costs,
which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise
prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general
and administrative expenses. These costs were $35.5 million, $25.7 million and $23.2 million for
2004, 2003 and 2002.

Advertising and Promotional Costs

We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred. Total advertising and
promotional expenses were $21.9 million, $18.6 million and $13.9 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002.
Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection with direct marketing,
including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period which is benefited, generally one year. As of December 25, 2004 and December
27, 2003, we had $3.4 million and $2.2 million of deferred direct marketing expenses included in
other current assets.

Inventories

Inventories consist substantially of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out method.

Note 1— Significant Accounting Policies— (Continued)

Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful
life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation is computed primarily under the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives:

Years

Buildings
and permanent improvements


Machinery and warehouse equipment

5-10

Furniture, fixtures and other

3-10

Computer equipment and software

3-10

Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software. Costs incurred
during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside
vendors for our use and software developed by a vendor for our proprietary use are capitalized.
Costs incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software development may also
be capitalized.

Taxes on Income

We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future
tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes
in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
will be recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined
using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in earnings.

Note 1— Significant Accounting Policies— (Continued)

Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to manage the impact that interest rate and
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair
values, earnings and cash flows. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative
purposes. Our derivative instruments include interest rate swap agreements related to our
long-term fixed rate debt and foreign currency forward and swap contracts related to intercompany
loans and certain forecasted transactions with foreign vendors. We consider our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries to be both long-term and strategic and consequently do not hedge such
investments. Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be
effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be designated as a
hedge at the inception of the contract.

Our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedging instruments. The terms
of our interest rate swap agreements are identical to the Senior Notes and consequently qualify for
an assumption of no ineffectiveness under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“FAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Both
the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying Senior Notes are marked-to-market through
earnings at the end of each period; however, since our interest rate swap agreements are deemed
fully effective, these mark-to-market adjustments have no net impact on earnings.

Our foreign currency forward and exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedging
instruments. These contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and all changes in
fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions
are recognized. Upon recognition, such gains or losses are recorded in operations as an adjustment
to the carrying amounts of the underlying transactions in the period in which these transactions
are recognized.

Acquisitions

The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.
Any excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Certain acquisitions provide for contingent consideration, primarily cash, to be paid
in the event certain financial performance targets are satisfied over future periods. We have not
accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions because the outcome of the
contingencies is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are
subject to annual impairment tests. Such impairment tests require a comparison of the fair value
and carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based
on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is
available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. We assess
the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and on
an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable.



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1— Significant Accounting Policies— (Continued)

Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business; and

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends.

If we determine through the impairment review process that indefinite-lived intangible assets
have been impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income. Based
on our impairment review process, we have not recorded any impairments during 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade
names and customer relationships. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down
to fair value. We have not recorded any material impairments during 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Cost of Sales

The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product (net of purchase
discounts, vendor chargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges. Costs related
to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of
our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expense along with
other operating costs.

As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks
throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution
companies. Total distribution network costs were $58.3
million, $32.2 million and $28.1
million for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock option awards under the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under this method, no
compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted
market price of the stock at the grant date.

We make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method of accounting (the alternative method of accounting for stock-based compensation) had been
applied as required by FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” The fair
value-based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk-free interest rates,
stock price volatility, dividend yield and weighted-average option life.

Note 1— Significant Accounting Policies— (Continued)

Under the accounting provisions of FAS 123, our net income and earnings per share would have
been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below. The following assumptions
were used in determining the fair values: weighted-average risk-free interest rates of 3.0%, 3.0%
and 4.0% for 2004, 2003 and 2002; stock price volatility of 30.0% for 2004 and 45.0% for 2003 and
2002; dividend yield of 0% and weighted-average expected option life of 5 years for 2004, 2003 and
2002.

Beginning
in the third quarter of 2005, in connection with our adoption of FAS
123(R);
“Share-Based Payment” (discussed below in ‘New Accounting Pronouncements’), stock-based
compensation will be included in our results of operations. The method and assumptions used to
determine the fair value of stock-based compensation under FAS 123(R) will be similar to those used
under FAS 123.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded
directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised
of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments, but also includes unrealized gains
(losses) on hedging activity and marketable securities and a pension adjustment loss in 2003.

Stock Split

On January 31, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a dividend. This stock split became effective on February 28, 2005
and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in the accompanying financial
statements and footnotes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” This Statement
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs
liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This
Statement changes the accounting for



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1— Significant Accounting Policies— (Continued)

transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.
This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with
parties other than employees provided in FAS 123 as originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18,
“Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.” This Statement is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and applies to all outstanding and unvested stock-based
payment awards at the date of adoption. We anticipate the adoption of
FAS 123(R) will affect our
results of operations to an extent similar to that as presented in our FAS 123 pro forma disclosure
above.

In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4.” This Statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). This Statement requires that such items
be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so
abnormal.” In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This
Statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. The provisions of FAS 151 must be applied prospectively. We do not anticipate the adoption
of FAS 151 to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 109-2 “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”),
provides guidance under FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” with respect to recording the
potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the
“Jobs Act”) on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was
enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the
financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for
reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FAS No. 109. We have not
yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions. Accordingly, as provided for
in FSP 109-2, we have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the
repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act.

Note 2—Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to
basic, except it reflects the effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options using
the treasury stock method in periods in which they have a dilutive
effect. The dilutive effect of our convertible debt will be reflected
in diluted earnings per share by application of the
‘if converted’ method. For the year ended
December 25, 2004, diluted earnings per share does not include the effect of common shares issuable
upon conversion of our convertible debt because the principal is required to be repaid in cash. If
at any time, the debt is convertible at a premium as a result of the conditions of the debt, the
amount in excess of the principal will be repaid in common shares.

A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share follows:

outstanding during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
share. In each of these periods, the options’ exercise prices exceeded the average market price of
our common stock, thereby causing the effect of such options to be anti-dilutive.

Non-compete agreements represent amounts paid primarily to key employees and prior owners of
acquired businesses in exchange for placing restrictions on their ability to pose a competitive
risk to us. Such amounts are amortized, on a straight-line basis over the
respective non-compete period, which generally commences upon termination of employment or
separation from us. The weighted-average non-compete period for agreements currently being
amortized was approximately 11 years as of December 25, 2004.

Trademarks, trade names and customer relationships were established through business
acquisitions. Certain trademarks and trade names, totaling $25.7 million and $8.1 million as of
December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, are deemed indefinite-lived intangible assets and are not
amortized. The remainder are deemed definite-lived and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
a weighted-average period of approximately 2 years as of December 25, 2004. Customer relationships
are definite-lived intangible assets that are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
weighted-average period of approximately 10 years as of December 25, 2004.

Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $10.1 million,
$3.2 million and $1.1 million. The annual amortization expense expected for the years 2005 through
2009 is $11.2 million, $10.5 million, $9.0 million, $7.1 million and $6.4 million.

Note 7—Business Acquisitions and Divestiture

On June 18, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of Demedis GmbH (excluding
its Austrian operations), which we believe is a leading full-service distributor of dental
consumables and equipment in Germany, Austria, and the Benelux countries; and Euro Dental Holding
GmbH, which included KRUGG S.p.A., which we believe is Italy’s leading distributor of dental
consumable products, and DentalMV GmbH (otherwise known as Muller & Weygandt, or “M&W”). We refer
to these entities collectively as the “Demedis Group.”

As part of our agreement with the German regulatory authorities, we agreed to divest M&W
shortly after the consummation of the acquisition, effected through exercising a put option back to the
previous owners. On July 16, 2004, this divestiture was completed for EUR 50.0 million (or $62.2
million), including the assumption of debt of approximately EUR 27.5 million (or $34.2 million),
resulting in a reduction of the purchase price for the Demedis Group.

As part of the agreement to divest M&W, we were entitled to receive 50% of the net sale
proceeds in excess of EUR 55.0 million, in the event M&W was subsequently resold before June 18,
2005. On September 24, 2004, an agreement was signed to resell M&W for an amount that resulted in
our realizing a share of the net sale proceeds equal to EUR 26.4 million (or $32.4 million), which
we received in October 2004. This amount was treated as a further reduction of the purchase price
for the Demedis Group.

The regulatory authorities are continuing their review of our pending acquisition of the
Demedis Group’s business in Austria, which operates under the Austrodent brand. Of the total
purchase price for the Demedis Group, EUR 11.0 million (or $13.5 million) was attributable to
Austrodent, which was included in other current assets as of December 25, 2004. In the event that
we receive regulatory approval to acquire Austrodent, this amount will be reclassified based on the
fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired through a purchase price allocation, with an
increase to goodwill for any excess of



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note 7—Business Acquisitions and Divestiture — (Continued)

purchase price over fair value. In the event that we do not receive regulatory approval to acquire
Austrodent, we are entitled to receive the proceeds through a sale of Austrodent, net of selling
costs, up to EUR 11.0 million. Any shortfall between the EUR 11.0 million and the proceeds received upon a
subsequent sale of Austrodent will be recorded as an addition to goodwill of the Demedis Group.

Excluding its Austrian operations and giving effect to the proceeds received from the
divestiture and subsequent resale of M&W as discussed above, the cash paid for the Demedis Group
was approximately EUR 51.8 million (or $62.9 million), including transaction costs. The following
table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
including goodwill established, at the date of acquisition. The amounts were based on our best
estimates and third-party valuations (with respect to intangible assets):

Of the $59.8 million of acquired intangible assets, $43.2 million was assigned to customer
relationships (with a weighted-average useful life of 10 years), $4.1 million was assigned to
registered trademarks and trade names (with a weighted-average useful life of 2 years) and $12.5
million was assigned to registered trademarks and trade names that are not subject to amortization.
Of the total amount of $137.3 million assigned to goodwill, none is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes.

We financed the acquisition of the Demedis Group primarily with cash on hand, borrowings under
our existing revolving credit facility and with proceeds from a bridge loan in the amount of $150.0
million. These borrowings were repaid in full with the net proceeds from the issuance of $240.0
million of long-term convertible debt on August 9, 2004 as discussed in Note 8.

The operating results of the Demedis Group, including M&W (which was accounted for using the
equity method through the date of the divestiture) and excluding Austrodent, are included in the
accompanying financial statements since the acquisition date of June 18, 2004.
Assuming the acquisition of the Demedis Group occurred at the beginning of our fiscal year
ended December 27, 2003, excluding the results of Austrodent and M&W, our pro forma net sales would
have been approximately $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion for 2004 and 2003. These unaudited net sales
amounts do not purport to be indicative of what our net sales would have been had the above
transaction been completed at the beginning of our fiscal year ended December 27, 2003. The pro
forma effect of the acquisition of the Demedis Group on our net income and earnings per share was
not material.

Note 7—Business Acquisitions and Divestiture  — (Continued)

In addition to the Demedis Group acquisition, we completed other acquisitions and made
earn-out payments that resulted in recording additional goodwill during 2004. None of these
transactions were material individually or in the aggregate. During the year ended December 27,
2003, we acquired eight healthcare distribution businesses, which were not considered material on either an individual or
aggregate basis.

On August 29, 2003, we sold PMA Bode GmbH, an x-ray film distribution business located in
Germany, which was a component of our healthcare distribution business segment. PMA Bode generated
annual net sales of approximately $31.0 million. The loss recorded on the sale of PMA Bode was
approximately $2.0 million (net of $54 tax benefit) and is presented separately as a loss on sale
of discontinued operation, net of tax, in our statements of income. Due to immateriality, we have
not reflected the operating results of PMA Bode separately as a discontinued operation for any of
the periods presented.

Note 8—Debt

Bank Credit Lines

We have a Revolving Credit Facility of $200.0 million that is a committed line scheduled to
terminate in May 2006. The interest rate is based on LIBOR plus 0.625%, which represents our
spread based on our covenants at December 25, 2004. The agreement provides, among other things,
that we maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios, and contains restrictions
relating to annual dividends in excess of $25.0 million, guarantees of subsidiary debt, investments
in subsidiaries, mergers and acquisitions, liens, certain changes in ownership and employee and
shareholder loans. As of December 25, 2004, there were $8.3 million of letters of credit provided
to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.

As of December 25, 2004, we had available various short-term bank credit lines of which $6.0
million was outstanding. Such credit lines bear interest at rates
ranging from 3.0% to 6.25%, and
were collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory and property and equipment with an aggregate
net carrying value of $25.3 million at December 25, 2004.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we issued $130.0
million and $100.0 million in Senior Notes. The $130.0 million notes mature on June 30, 2009 and
bear interest at a rate of 6.94% per annum. Principal payments on the $100.0 million notes
totaling $20.0 million annually are due starting September 25, 2006 and bear interest at a rate of
6.66% per annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually.

The agreement governing our Senior Notes provides, among other things, that we will maintain
on a consolidated basis, certain leverage and priority debt ratios and a minimum net worth. The
agreement also contains restrictions relating to transactions with affiliates, annual dividends
(limited to the greater of $25.0 million or 40% of net income), mergers and acquisitions and liens.

During the year ended December 27, 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements
relating to our $230.0 million Senior Notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable
interest rates. The weighted-average variable interest rate was 5.05% as of December 25, 2004.
This variable rate is comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates of the
Senior Notes.

On August 9, 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These
notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to
mature on August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each
year, beginning on February 15, 2005. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a
conversion ratio of 21.58 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is
the equivalent conversion price of $46.34 per share, under the following circumstances:

•

if the last price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion
price measured over a specified number of trading days;

•

during the five business-day period following any 10 consecutive
trading-day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10
trading-day period was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes
during that period;

Note 8—Debt — (Continued)

•

if the notes have been called for redemption; or

•

upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified
corporate transactions, as defined in the note agreement.

Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the
principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied
in shares of our common stock. We will also pay contingent interest during any six-month interest
period beginning August 15, 2010 if the average trading price of the notes is above specified
levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August 20, 2010. The note holders may
require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August 15, 2010, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029
or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event.

As of December 25, 2004, the aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturing in each of the next
five years are as follows: 2005 — $3.9 million; 2006 —
$24.8 million; 2007 — $22.3 million; 2008 —
$21.9 million; 2009 — $160.4 million.

carryforwards of $10.3 million, which are available to offset future federal taxable income through
2024. Foreign net operating losses totaled $220.6 million as of December 25, 2004. Of such
losses, $1.9 million can be utilized against future foreign income through 2011 and $218.7 million

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries, which have been, and will continue to be reinvested. These earnings could
become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were
loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate, or if we should sell our stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It
is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be payable on the
foreign earnings; however, we believe that



HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 9—Taxes on Income—(Continued)

foreign tax credits may substantially offset any U.S. tax liabilities. As of December 25, 2004,
the cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was approximately $21.4 million.

Note 10—Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash equivalents and trade receivables

— Due to the short-term maturity of such instruments, the
carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-term investments and notes receivable

— The fair value of long-term marketable securities is
estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments. Such instruments are carried at
fair value on the balance sheet. There are no quoted market prices available for investments in
unconsolidated affiliates and notes receivable; however, we believe the carrying amounts are a
reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-term debt

— The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices
for our traded debt and on market prices of similar issues for our private debt. The fair value of
our long-term debt as of December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 was estimated at $540.2 million
and $247.1 million.

Derivative instruments

— The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate
swap agreements are estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers. Such instruments are carried at
fair value on the balance sheet. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts as of
December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 was estimated at $(1.2) million and $(9.4) million which
approximated contract value. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was estimated at
$(1.4) million, representing the estimated amount we would pay to terminate the agreements as of
December 25, 2004, which takes into account current interest rates, market expectations for future
interest rates and our current creditworthiness.

Note 10—Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk — (Continued)

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. These
financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term
investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments. In all cases, our maximum exposure to
loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments. We continuously
assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have historically been within our expectations.
We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit
risk, except for long-term notes receivable.

With respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative
instruments, our credit risk is limited due to our counter-parties being high-credit quality
financial institutions. As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by
utilizing numerous different counter-parties.

With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively
large customer base and its dispersion across different types of healthcare professionals and
geographic areas. We do have some concentrations of credit risk associated with our sales to
hospitals; however, such credit risks are somewhat mitigated by our method of monitoring
credit-worthiness and collectibility of larger accounts on a customer-by-customer basis. No single
customer accounted for more than 1.1% of our net sales in 2004.

Our long-term note receivables represent strategic financing arrangements with certain
industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses. Generally, these
notes are secured by certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other
commercial financial institutions. While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of
non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and
operational performance.

Note 11—Segment and Geographic Data

We conduct our business through two segments: healthcare distribution and technology. These
segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The healthcare
distribution segment consists of our dental, medical (including veterinary) and international
groups. Products distributed consist of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products,
large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products,
diagnostic tests, infection control products and vitamins.

Our dental group serves office-based dental practices in the combined United States and
Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office-based physician practices, as well as
surgical centers and other alternate-care settings and veterinarian clinics throughout the United
States. Our international group serves practices in 17 countries outside of North America and we
believe it is a leading Pan-European healthcare supplier serving office-based dental, medical and
veterinary practices.

Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to healthcare
providers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value-added practice solutions include
practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and veterinary clinics. Our
technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for
practitioners.

Note 12—Stockholders’ Equity

(a) Common Stock Purchase Rights

On November 30, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the “Rights
Plan”), and declared a dividend under the Rights Plan of one common stock purchase right (a
“Right”) on each outstanding share of our common stock. Until the occurrence of certain events,
each share of common stock that is issued will also have attached to it a Right. The Rights
provide, in substance, that should any person or group acquire 15% or more of our outstanding
common stock after the date of adoption of the Rights Plan, each Right, other than Rights held by
the acquiring person or group, would entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of
common stock for 50% of the then-current market value of the common stock. Unless a 15%
acquisition has occurred, we may redeem the Rights at any time prior to the termination date of the
Rights Plan. This Right to purchase the common stock at a discount will not be triggered by a
person’s or group’s acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer which is for all outstanding shares at a price and on terms that the Board of Directors
determines (prior to acquisition) to be adequate and in the stockholders’ best interests. In
addition, the Right will not be triggered by the positions of existing shareholders.

Certain business combinations involving an acquiring person or its affiliates will trigger an
additional feature of the Rights. Each Right, other than Rights held by the acquiring person or
group, will entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring person at a price equal to 50% of the market value of such shares at the time of
exercise. Initially, the Rights will be attached to, and trade with, the certificates representing
our outstanding shares of common stock and no separate certificates representing the Rights will be
distributed. The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires, or commences a
tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of our common stock.

The Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all, but not less than all of the then
outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of (a)
any person or group acquiring 15% or more of our common stock or (b) the final expiration date of
November 30, 2008.

(b) Stock Options

As previously discussed, on January 31, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a dividend. This stock split became
effective on February 28, 2005 and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in
the accompanying financial statements and footnotes.

We established the 1994 Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) for the benefit of certain employees.
As amended in May 2004, pursuant to this plan we may issue up to approximately 20,159,270 shares of
our common stock. The Plan provides for two classes of options: Class A options and Class B
options. A maximum of 475,794 shares of common stock may be covered by Class A options. Both
incentive and non-qualified stock options may be issued under the Plan.

In 1995, Class A options to acquire 475,794 common shares were issued to certain executive
management at an exercise price of $2.11 per share, substantially all of which became exercisable
upon the closing of our initial public offering, which was on November 3, 1995. The exercise price
of all Class B options issued has been equal to the market price on the date of grant, and
accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized. Substantially all Class B options issued
prior to 2004 vest evenly over three years from the date of grant; however shares exercised in the
second and third year after the

date of grant may not be sold until the third anniversary of the date of grant. Substantially all
Class B options issued in 2004 vest evenly over four years; however shares exercised in the second

tenth anniversary of the date of issuance, subject to acceleration upon termination of employment.

On May 8, 1996, our stockholders approved the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan.
As amended in May 2004, pursuant to this plan we may grant options to each director who is not also
an officer or employee, for up to 800,000 shares of our common stock. The exercise price and term,
not to exceed 10 years, of each option is determined by the plan committee at the time of the
grant. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, 90,000, 100,000 and 80,000 options, were granted to certain
non-employee directors at exercise prices equal to the market price on the date of grant.

Additionally, in 1997 as a result of our acquisition of Sullivan Dental Products, Inc. and
Micro Bio-Medics, Inc., we assumed their respective stock option plans (the “Assumed Plans”).
Options granted under the Assumed Plans of 2,436,000 and 2,234,000, which are convertible into our
common stock, are exercisable for up to ten years from the date of grant at prices not less than
the fair market value of the respective acquirees’ common stock at the date of grant.

A summary of the status of our stock option plans, including the Assumed Plans, is presented

(c) Employee Benefit Plans

401(k) Plan

We offer qualified, 401(k) plans to substantially all our domestic full-time employees. As
determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans are equal to 100% of
the participants’ contributions up to 7% of their base compensation. Matching contributions
include both cash and our common stock. Forfeitures attributable to participants whose employment
terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to reduce our matching contributions.

Assets of the 401(k) plans are held in self-directed accounts enabling participants to choose
from various investment fund options. Matching contributions to these plans charged to operations
during 2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $10.3 million, $7.6 million and $5.3 million.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan to eligible
employees. This plan generally covers officers and certain highly-compensated employees after they
have reached the maximum IRS allowed pre-tax 401(k) contribution limit. Our contributions to this
plan are equal to the 401(k) employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base compensation
for the portion of the year in which such employees are not eligible to make pre-tax contributions
to the 401(k) plan. The amounts charged to operations during 2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $566,
$839 and $707.

We have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from Chiron
Corporation and ID Biomedical Corporation. Given the uncertainties
surrounding the pending FDA approval for both companies to
distribute influenza vaccine in the U.S. for the 2005/2006 influenza
season, we have excluded these purchase obligations from the above
table.

Our
purchase commitment under our agreement with Chiron Corporation would
require us to pay $122.5 million in 2005 if they are able to
meet their obligations under the agreement. Our
purchase commitment under our agreement with ID Biomedical which
terminates in 2014 would
require us to pay an amount per dose based each year on the market price then prevailing. Under current market prices, this commitment would aggregate to approximately $45.0 million for
2005, increasing to approximately $113.0 million in 2007 and each
year thereafter.

Litigation

Our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary
course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally
obtain product indemnification from our suppliers for manufactured products.

We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and
in amounts we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance that the coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts
or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate
protection. In our opinion, all pending matters, including those described below, are covered by
insurance or will not otherwise seriously harm our financial condition.

As of December 25, 2004, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability, class action and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and
for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related
expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our
method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws
and regulations and other external factors, including probable recoveries from third parties. In
addition, we believe that no amount of losses in excess of this accrued amount were reasonably
estimable or reasonably possible to result in a liability.

Product Liability Claims

As of December 25, 2004, we were a defendant in approximately 38 product liability cases. Of
these cases, three involve claims made by healthcare workers and/or their families who claim allergic
reaction relating to exposure to latex gloves. In each of these cases, we acted as a distributor
of brand name and/or

Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies — (Continued)

“Henry Schein” private brand latex gloves, which were manufactured by third parties. To date,
discovery in these cases has generally been limited to product identification issues. The
manufacturers in these cases generally withhold indemnification of us pending product
identification; however, we have impleaded or filed cross claims against those manufacturers in
such cases.

Texas Class Action

On January 27, 1998, in District Court in Travis County, Texas, we and one of our subsidiaries
were named as defendants in a matter entitled “Shelly E. Stromboe and Jeanne Taylor, on Behalf of
Themselves and all others Similarly Situated vs. Henry Schein, Inc., Easy Dental Systems, Inc. and
Dentisoft, Inc.,” Case No. 98-00886. The petition alleges, among other things, negligence, breach
of contract, fraud, and violations of certain Texas commercial statutes involving the sale of
certain practice management software products sold prior to 1998 under the Easy Dental® name.

In October 1999, the trial court, on motion, certified both a Windows® sub-class and a DOS
sub-class to proceed as a class action pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 42. On October 31, 2002, the
Texas Supreme Court, on appeal, found that the trial court’s certification of the case as a class
action was improper. The Texas Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for further
proceedings consistent with its opinion.

The trial court ruled in our favor on remand. As a result, only certain individual claims
asserted on behalf of the named plaintiffs remained pending in the case as of the end of 2004. We
settled such claims in January 2005 for an immaterial amount which we accrued as a liability as of
December 25, 2004.

Purported Class Action in New Jersey

In February 2002, we were served with a summons and complaint in an action commenced in the
Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County, entitled “West Morris Pediatrics, P.A.
and Avenel-Iselin Medical Group, P.A. vs. Henry Schein, Inc., doing business as Caligor,” Case No.
MRS-L-421-02. The plaintiffs’ complaint purported to be on behalf of a nationwide class of all
physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers throughout New Jersey and across the United
States. The complaint, as amended in August 2002, alleged breach of oral contract, breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act,
unjust enrichment, conversion and promissory estoppel relating to sales of a vaccine product in the
year 2001. In September 2004, the court denied class certification. As a result, only certain
individual claims asserted on behalf of the two named plaintiffs remained pending in the case as of
the end of 2004. We settled such claims in January 2005 for an immaterial amount which we accrued
as a liability as of December 25, 2004.

Employment, Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements

We
have employment, consulting and non-compete agreements expiring through 2009, except for a
lifetime consulting agreement with a former principal stockholder, which provides for current
compensation of $308 per year, increasing $25 every fifth year with the next increase in 2007. The
agreements provide for varying base aggregate annual payments of
approximately $5.8 million,
which decrease periodically to approximately $831. In addition, some agreements have provisions
for incentive and additional compensation.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a $13.2 million pre-tax ($8.4 million
post-tax) one-time charge, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to
our Fluvirin® contract with Chiron Corporation. This charge, which represented the
write-off of a deferred expense associated with the 2005/2006 influenza season,
occurred as a result of the significant uncertainty about whether Chiron will be able
to provide Fluvirin® for the 2005/2006 influenza season. The effect that this charge had on earnings per
share for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 25, 2004 was $(0.10).

In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a $726 pre-tax ($454

included in the “Other, net” line on the consolidated statements of income.
The effect that this gain had on earnings per share for the first quarter
2003 and year ended December 27, 2003 was $0.01.

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or
exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline.

Our business has been subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and
operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of
sales of software, equipment and seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products),
purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end promotions. Net sales
and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased
sales in the prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of
other factors, including:

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet or exceed market
expectations, our stock price may decline.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO Framework”).
Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 25, 2004.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 25, 2004 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered
certified public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors

Henry Schein, Inc.

Melville, New York

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

,

that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Henry Schein Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also in our opinion, Henry
Schein, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 25, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).



We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of December 25,
2004 and December 27, 2003 and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 25, 2004, and our report dated February
28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
