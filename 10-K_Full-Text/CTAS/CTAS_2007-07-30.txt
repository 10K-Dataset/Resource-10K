Part
      I

Item
      1.  Business

Cintas
      Corporation (Cintas), a Washington corporation, provides highly specialized
      products and services to businesses of all types throughout the United States
      and Canada.  Cintas’ products and services are designed to enhance its
      customers’ images and brand identification as well as provide a safe and
      efficient work place.  Cintas was founded in 1968 by Richard T.
      Farmer, Chairman of the Board, when he left his family’s industrial laundry
      business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new
      fabric.  In the early 1970’s, Cintas acquired the family industrial
      laundry business.  Over the years, Cintas developed additional
      products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened
      the scope of products and services available to our customers.

The
      products and services provided by Cintas are as follows:

·

Uniforms
                and Apparel

·

Mats,
                Mops and Towels

·

Restroom
                and Hygiene Service

·

                Aid

·

Safety

·

Fire
                Protection

·

Branded
                Promotional Products

·

                Shredding and Storage

·

Cleanroom
                Resources

·

Flame
                Resistant Clothing

These
      products and services are provided to approximately 800,000 businesses of all
      types – from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations
      that employ thousands of people.  This diversity in customer base
      results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of
      Cintas’ total revenues.  As a result, the loss of one account would
      not have a significant financial impact on Cintas.

Cintas
      classifies its business into two operating segments, Rentals and Other Services,
      based on the similar economic and organizational characteristics of the products
      and services within each segment. The Rentals segment reflects the rental and
      servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops and shop
      towels.  In addition to these rental items, we also provide restroom
      and hygiene products and services within this segment.  The Other
      Services segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items,
      first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management
      services and branded promotional products.

The
      following table sets forth the revenues derived from each operating segment
      provided by Cintas:

See
      Note
      13 entitled Segment Information in “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.”

The
      primary markets served by both Cintas operating segments are local in nature
      and
      highly fragmented.  Cintas competes with national, regional and local
      providers, and the level of competition varies at each of Cintas’
locations.  Product, design, price, quality, service and convenience
      to the customer are the competitive elements in both operating
      segments.

Within
      the Rentals segment, Cintas provides its products and services to customers
      via
      local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and
      branches.  Within the Other Services segment,


Cintas
      provides its products and services via its distribution network and local
      delivery routes or local representatives.  In total, Cintas has
      approximately 7,300 local delivery routes, 407 operations and 7 distribution
      centers.

Cintas
      sources finished products from many outside suppliers.  In addition,
      Cintas operates eleven manufacturing facilities which provide for a substantial
      amount of its standard uniform needs.  Cintas purchases fabric, used
      in its manufacturing process, from several suppliers.  Cintas is not
      aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to continue obtaining
      these materials.

Cintas
      is
      subject to various environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies
      in
      the uniform rental industry.  While environmental compliance is not a
      material component of our costs, Cintas must incur capital expenditures and
      associated operating costs, primarily for water treatment and waste removal,
      on
      a regular basis.  Environmental spending related to water treatment
      and waste removal was approximately $16 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal
      2006.  Capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances
      were approximately $2 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.  These
      expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems,
      which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years.  Cintas does
      not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a
      percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material non-compliance with
      environmental laws.

At
      May
      31, 2007, Cintas employed approximately 34,000 employees of which approximately
      400 were represented by labor unions.  Since January 2003, Cintas has
      been the target of a corporate unionization campaign by Unite Here and the
      Teamsters unions.  These unions are attempting to pressure Cintas into
      surrendering its employees’ rights to a government-supervised election and
      unilaterally accept union representation.  This is
      unacceptable.  Cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is
      straightforward:  We believe that employees have the right to say yes
      to union representation and the freedom to say no.  This campaign
      could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely
      affect results of operations.  We will continue to vigorously oppose
      this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights.  Cintas considers
      its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory.

Cintas
      files annual and quarterly reports and proxy materials with the Securities
      and
      Exchange Commission (SEC).  The public may copy these materials at the
      SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580 Washington,
      D.C.  20549 and may obtain further information concerning the
      operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (800)
      SEC-0330.  The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains the same
      information regarding Cintas that is filed electronically with the
      SEC.  The address of that site is:
      http://www.sec.gov.  Cintas’ Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly
      Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those
      reports are available free of charge as posted on its website, www.cintas.com,
      as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing with the
      SEC.  Cintas is not including the other information contained on its
      website as part of or incorporating it by reference into this Annual Report
      on
      Form 10-K.


Item
      1A.  Risk Factors

The
      statements in this section, as well as statements described elsewhere in this
      Form 10-K, or in other SEC filings, describe risks that could materially and
      adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,
      and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could
      decline.  These risks are not the only risks that we
      face.  Our business, financial condition and results of operations
      could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to
      us
      or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.

In
      addition, this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary
      statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
      1995.

Forward-Looking
      Statements

The
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from
      civil litigation for forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking
      statements may be identified by words such as “estimates,” “anticipates,”
“predicts,” “projects,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “target,” “forecast,”
“believes,” “seeks,” “could,” “should,” “may” and “will” or the negative
      versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are
      used.  Such statements are based upon current expectations of Cintas and
      speak only as of the date made.  We cannot guarantee that any
      forward-looking statement will be realized.  These statements are
      subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause
      actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this Annual
      Report.  Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not
      limited to, the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs
      including energy costs, lower sales volumes, loss of customers due to
      outsourcing trends, the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions,
      fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs,
      costs and possible effects of union organizing activities, failure to comply
      with government regulations concerning employment discrimination, employee
      pay
      and benefits and employee health and safety, uncertainties regarding any
      existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental
      compliance and remediation, the cost, results and ongoing assessment of internal
      controls for financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
      the
      initiation or outcome of litigation, higher assumed sourcing or distribution
      costs of products, the disruption of operations from catastrophic events,
      changes in federal and state tax laws and the reactions of competitors in terms
      of price and service.  Cintas undertakes no obligation to update any
      forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect
      events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are
      made.  You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we
      make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q and 8-K reports to the
      SEC.

Also
      note
      that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties
      and
      possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses. These are factors
      that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results
      to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors
      for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
      of
      1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify
      all
      such factors.  The risks and uncertainties described herein are not
      the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties presently not
      known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our
      business.

Consequently,
      you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all
      potential risks or uncertainties.

General
      economic factors may adversely affect our financial
      performance.

General
      economic conditions, in North America and globally, may adversely affect our
      financial performance.  Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, tax
      rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely
      affect the demand for Cintas products and services.  Increases in
      labor costs including healthcare and insurance costs, labor shortages or
      shortages of skilled labor, higher material costs for items such as fabrics
      and
      textiles, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher interest rates, inflation,
      higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could
      increase our costs of rentals and other services and selling and administrative
      expenses and could adversely affect our results of operations.


Increased
      competition could adversely affect our financial performance.

We
      operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national, regional
      and
      local providers.  Product, design, price, quality, service and
      convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these
      industries.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain
      market share by reducing prices, Cintas may be required to lower prices, which
      would hurt our results of operations. Cintas’ competitors also generally compete
      with Cintas for acquisition candidates, which can increase the price for
      acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition
      candidates.  In addition, our customers and prospects may decide to
      perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing these services to
      Cintas.  These competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales
      and results of operations.

Risks
      associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely
      affect our results of operations.

The
      products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international
      suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important
      factor in our financial performance.  We require all of our suppliers
      to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and
      otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct.
      Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access
      products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially
      with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States.
      Political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers
      are
      located, the financial stability of suppliers, suppliers’ failure to meet our
      supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the
      availability of raw materials to suppliers, currency exchange rates, transport
      availability and cost, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers
      and
      the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition,
      United States and Canadian foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions
      on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation
      on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain
      materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade
      are
      beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our
      access to products could adversely affect our results of
      operations.

An
      inability to open new, cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect
      our expansion efforts.

We
      plan
      to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets.  The
      opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required
      for this expansion.  Our ability to open new operating facilities
      depends on our ability to identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or
      real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, identify and obtain
      adequate utility and water sources, and comply with environmental regulations,
      zoning laws and other similar factors.  Any inability to effectively
      identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts,
      and,
      consequently, adversely affect our financial performance.

Unionization
      campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations.

Cintas
      continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by several
      unions.  These unions are attempting to pressure Cintas into
      surrendering our employees' rights to a government-supervised election by
      unilaterally accepting union representation.  We continue to
      vigorously oppose this campaign and defend our employees' rights to a
      government-supervised election.  This campaign could be materially
      disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect our results
      of
      operations.

Within
      our Document Management business, we handle customers’ confidential
      information.  Our failure to protect our customers’ confidential
      information against security breaches could damage our reputation, harm our
      business and adversely impact our results of operations.

Our Document
      Management business includes both document destruction and document storage
      services.  These services involve the handling of our customers’
confidential information and the subsequent shredding or storage of this
      information.  Any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of
      customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to
      risk of liability, which could harm our business and adversely impact our
      results of operations.


Compliance
      with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that
      adversely affect our results of operations.

Our
      operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating
      to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including
      those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management
      and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated
      sites. The operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws
      and regulations. We could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs,
      fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal
      injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and
      regulations. We are currently involved in a limited number of remedial
      investigations and actions at various locations.  While, based on
      information currently known to us, we believe that we maintain adequate reserves
      with respect to these matters, our liability could exceed forecasted amounts,
      and the imposition of additional clean-up obligations or the discovery of
      additional contamination at these or other sites could result in additional
      costs. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required
      to
      comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that
      may
      be adopted or imposed in the future.

Under
      environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to
      pay
      the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating
      from property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible
      for the presence of such hazardous materials.  While Cintas regularly
      engages in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions, we
      can
      give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been
      operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior
      periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these
      laws or expose us to third-party actions including tort suits.

We
      are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial
      condition and results of operations.

We
      are
      party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.  Certain of
      these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or
      settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial condition
      and
      results of operations.  We discuss these lawsuits and other litigation
      to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “Item 3. Legal
      Proceedings” and in Note 12 entitled Litigation and Other Contingencies of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Failure
      to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
      Administration and other state and local agencies that oversee safety compliance
      could adversely affect our results of operations.

The
      Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or “OSHA”, establishes
      certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free
      of
      recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with
      standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
      and
      various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various OSHA
      standards may apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue
      to
      incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course
      of our business in complying with OSHA and other state and local laws and
      regulations.  The failure to comply with these regulations could
      result in fines by government authorities, payment of damages to private
      litigants and affect our ability to service our customers.

Risks
      associated with our acquisition policy could adversely affect our results of
      operations.

Historically,
      a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions.  We continue to
      evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal
      growth.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
      locate and purchase suitable acquisitions.  In addition, the success
      of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired
      company.  The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve
      unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our
      management’s attention and our financial and other
      resources.  Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to
      each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover all material
      liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a
      successor owner or operator.  The failure to successfully integrate
      these acquired businesses or to discover such liabilities could adversely affect
      our results of operations.


We
      may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel
      in
      key positions.

We
      believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture which
      has
      been imparted by management throughout our corporate
      organization.  This factor, along with our entire operation, depends
      on our ability to attract and retain key employees.  Competitive
      pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and
      expensive for us to attract and retain key employees.

Unexpected
      events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of
      operations.

Unexpected
      events, including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters such
      as
      hurricanes and tornados, war or terrorist activities, unplanned outages, supply
      disruptions, failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws and/or
      regulations impacting our business, could adversely affect our results of
      operations.   These events could result in customer disruption,
      physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure
      of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of
      information systems.

Failure
      to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect
      our
      business and stock price.

Effective
      internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial
      reports.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
      have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined
      to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
      statement preparation and presentation.  While we continue to evaluate
      our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure
      that
      we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and
      reporting in the future.  If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our
      internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting
      firm
      were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, as such standards
      are modified, supplemented or amended, we may not be able to ensure that we
      can
      conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over
      financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
      Act of 2002.  Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal
      control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial
      reports or prevent fraud.  This may cause investors to lose confidence
      in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse
      effect on our stock price.

      2.  Properties

Cintas
      occupies 414 facilities located in 280 cities.  Cintas leases 210 of
      these facilities for various terms ranging from monthly to the year
      2016.  Cintas expects that it will be able to renew its leases on
      satisfactory terms.  Of the eleven manufacturing facilities listed
      below, Cintas controls the operations of three of these manufacturing
      facilities, but does not own or lease the real estate related to these
      operations.  All other facilities are owned.  The corporate
      office provides centrally located administrative functions including accounting,
      finance, marketing and computer system development and support. Cintas operates
      rental processing plants that house administrative, sales and service personnel
      and the necessary equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and bulk items,
      such as entrance mats and shop towels.  Branch operations provide
      administrative, sales and service functions. Cintas operates seven distribution
      centers and eleven manufacturing facilities.  Cintas also operates
      first aid, safety and fire protection and document management facilities and
      direct sales offices.  Cintas considers the facilities it operates to
      be adequate for their intended use. Cintas owns or leases

      Information

Cintas’
      Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol

“CTAS”.  The
      following table shows the high and low closing prices of shares of Cintas’
Common Stock by quarter during the last two fiscal years:

Holders

At
      May
      31, 2007, there were approximately 2,500 shareholders of record of Cintas’
Common Stock.  Cintas believes that this represents approximately
      65,000 beneficial owners.

Dividends

Dividends
      on the outstanding Common Stock have been paid annually and amounted to $0.39
      per share, $0.35 per share and $0.32 per share in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006
      and
      fiscal 2005, respectively.

Stock
      Performance Graph

The
      following graph summarizes the cumulative return on $100 invested in Cintas’
Common Stock, the S&P 500 Stock Index and the common stocks of a selected
      peer group of companies.  Prior to fiscal 2007, Cintas compared its
      common stock returns to the three largest publicly traded companies engaged
      primarily in the uniform related industry determined by net assets at year
      end
      (Old Peer Group).  The companies included in the Old Peer Group were
      Aramark Corporation, G & K Services, Inc. and UniFirst
      Corporation.  On or about January 26, 2007, Aramark Corporation ceased
      being listed on a public stock exchange.  As a result, Cintas made the
      change to a new peer group (New Peer Group).  Because our products and
      services are diverse, Cintas does not believe that any single published industry
      index is appropriate for comparing shareholder return.  Therefore, the
      New Peer Group used in the performance graph combines four publicly traded
      companies in the business services industry that have similar characteristics
      as
      Cintas, such as route based delivery of products and services.  The
      companies included in the New Peer Group are G & K Services, Inc., UniFirst
      Corporation, ABM Industries and Ecolab, Inc.


Total
      shareholder return was based on the increase in the price of the stock and
      assumed reinvestment of all dividends.  Further, total return was
      weighted according to market capitalization of each company.  The
      companies in the New Peer Group are not the same as those considered by the
      Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

On
      May 2,
      2005, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million
      stock buyback program at market prices.  In July 2006, Cintas
      announced that the Board of Directors approved the expansion of its share
      buyback program by an additional $500 million.  The Board of Directors
      did not specify an expiration date for the stock buyback program.

During
      fiscal 2007, Cintas purchased 4.8 million shares of Cintas stock at an average
      price of $41.38 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $199
      million.

In
      fiscal
      2007, Cintas also acquired 95,616 shares as payment received from employees
      upon
      the exercise of options under the stock option plan.

From
      the
      inception of the stock buyback program through July 27, 2007, Cintas has
      purchased a total of approximately 14.2 million shares of Cintas stock at an
      average price of $40.89 per share for a total purchase price of approximately
      $580.6 million.  The maximum approximate dollar value of shares that
      may yet be purchased under the plan as of July 27, 2007, is $419.4
      million.

      7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis

of
      Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business
      Strategy

Cintas
      provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types
      throughout the United States and Canada.  We refer to ourselves as
“The Service Professionals.”  We bring value to our customers by
      helping them provide a cleaner, safer, more pleasant atmosphere for their
      customers and employees.  Our products and services are designed to
      improve our customers’ image.  We also help our customers protect
      their employees and their company by enhancing workplace safety and helping
      to
      ensure legal compliance in key areas of their business.

We
      are
      North America's leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental
      and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business
      services, including entrance mats, restroom products and services, first aid,
      safety and fire protection products and services, document management services
      and branded promotional products.

Our
      business strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and
      services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening
      our customer base to include business segments to which Cintas has not
      historically served.  We will also continue to identify additional
      product and service opportunities for our current and future
      customers.  Our long-term goal is to provide a product or service to
      every business in North America.

To
      pursue
      the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse
      team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular
      basis.  This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop
      close personal relationships.  The combination of our distribution
      system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which
      we
      launch additional products and services.

We
      pursue
      the strategy of broadening our customer base in a few ways.  Cintas
      has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services
      to prospects in all business segments.  Our ever expanding range of
      products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of
      business a prospect.  We also broaden our customer base through
      geographic expansion, especially in our emerging businesses of first aid and
      safety, fire protection and document management.  Finally, we will
      continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.

Continuous
      cost containment and product and process innovation are considered hallmarks
      of
      our organization.  In order to sustain these efforts, we employ a Six
      Sigma effort within Cintas.  Six Sigma is an analytical process that
      assists companies in improving quality and customer satisfaction while reducing
      cycle time and operating costs.  We are pleased with our progress in
      this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this
      process will continue to yield to Cintas.

Results
      of Operations

Fiscal
      2007 marked the 38

th

consecutive
      year
      of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for Cintas.  In addition
      to achieving this milestone, Cintas increased its diluted earnings per share
      by
      8.9% and its dividends paid to shareholders by 11.4%.  During fiscal
      2007, we reorganzied our sales efforts to become more efficient and
      productive.  This reorganization effort has taken longer and been more
      costly in fiscal 2007 than anticipated.  However, Cintas continues to
      believe that this reorganization will benefit revenue growth results in the
      long-term.

Cintas
      classifies its businesses into two operating segments, Rentals and Other
      Services, based on the similar economic and organizational characteristics
      of
      the products and services within each segment. The Rentals segment reflects
      the
      rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops and shop
      towels.  In addition to these rental items, we also provide our
      restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment.  The
      Other Services segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related
      items, first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document
      management services and branded promotional products.  Both segments
      provide these products and services throughout the United States and Canada
      to
      businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to
      major corporations that employ thousands of people.


The
      following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as
      a
      percentage of revenue by segment and in total for the periods
      indicated:

*
      Restated to reflect the adoption of FAS 123(R) using the modified-retrospective
      method.  See Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies in “Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements."

As
      evidenced above, our revenue growth continues to be higher in the Other Services
      segment versus the Rentals segment, resulting in a moderate shift in the
      percentage of revenue between our segments.  This shift was mainly
      driven by the acquisitions of first aid, safety and fire protection businesses
      and document management businesses.  Information related to
      acquisitions is discussed in Note 8 entitled Acquisitions of “Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Fiscal
      2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Fiscal
      2007 total revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 8.9% over fiscal
      2006.  Internal growth was 5.3% in fiscal 2007, compared to 7.8% in
      fiscal 2006.  This decline in internal growth is due to economic
      pressure experienced throughout the year from the continued off-shoring of
      manufacturing jobs as well as the ripple effect felt at other customers that
      serve these manufacturing businesses.  In addition, the reorganization
      of our sales force has taken longer in the current year than we
      anticipated.

Our
      internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the sale of uniform
      rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary
      products to our existing customer base.  The remaining growth in total
      revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental, first aid,
      safety and fire protection service businesses and document management
      businesses.  Information related to acquisitions is discussed in Note
      8 entitled Acquisitions of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.”

Rentals
      segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental
      of
      corporate identity uniforms and other garments, and the rental and/or sale
      of
      mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental
      services.  Revenue from the Rentals segment increased 6.5% over fiscal
      2006.  Internal growth for the Rentals segment was 4.2% in fiscal
      2007.  The increase in the Rentals segment revenue was primarily due
      to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary
      products into our existing customer base.  New business remained the
      main driver of our internal growth as we continued to sell rental programs
      to
      new customers.  We also continued to expand our rental market, with
      over half of our new business being


comprised
      of customers who were first time users of uniform rental
      programs.  The remaining growth of 2.3% in fiscal 2007 resulted from
      the acquisition of rental volume.

Other
      Services segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design, manufacture
      and direct sale of uniforms and related items, first aid, safety and fire
      protection products and services, document management services and branded
      promotional products.  The Other Services segment revenue increased
      16.5% over fiscal 2006.  Internal growth in the Other Services segment
      was 8.6% in fiscal 2007.  This internal growth was mainly due to an
      increase in the customer base and through further penetration of first aid,
      safety and fire protection products and services and document management
      services into our existing customer base.  The remaining revenue
      growth of 7.9% was generated through the acquisitions of first aid, safety
      and
      fire protection businesses and document management businesses.

Cost
      of
      rentals increased 7.7% over fiscal 2006.  Cost of rentals consists
      primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of
      in
      service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other rental
      items.  The cost increase over fiscal 2006 was primarily driven by the
      growth in Rentals segment revenues.  In addition, delivery labor
      increased $34.1 million due to increased Rentals segment revenue and the
      introduction of our restroom cleaning service.  As a result, cost of
      rentals as a percent of Rentals segment revenues increased to 55.4% in fiscal
      2007 compared to 54.8% in fiscal 2006.

Cost
      of
      other services increased 12.6% over fiscal 2006.  Cost of other
      services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and
      first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses.  The
      increase over fiscal 2006 was due to the growth in Other Services revenue,
      derived through a combination of internal growth and
      acquisitions.  Gross margin within this segment may fluctuate
      depending on the type of product or service sold, as more cost efficient
      sourcing is employed and as products which require additional services or
      specialization generate higher gross margins.  For example, tailored
      garments that incorporate high levels of design and customization tend to
      generate higher gross margins than work wear and standard catalog
      items.  The gross margin for fiscal 2007 is 37.2%.  The
      gross margin for the Other Services segment has historically been in the 30%
      to
      35% range.  However, a combination of economies of scale at growing
      operations, Six Sigma, sourcing improvements and other cost containment
      initiatives have allowed us to exceed this historical range.  Due to
      the success of these initiatives and our continued efforts, we believe the
      future gross margins will be in the 35% to 40% range.

Selling
      and administrative expenses increased 10.1% over fiscal 2006.  Selling
      and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling
      expenses.  In fiscal 2007, we reorganized our sales efforts to become
      more efficient and productive in the long-term.  This reorganization,
      as well as increased marketing plans and sales promotions, combined to increase
      our selling costs by $32.6 million over the prior fiscal year.  The
      cost of providing medical and retirement benefits to our employees increased
      $21.8 million, representing a 15.7% increase over the prior year.  In
      addition, administrative expenses increased by $7.1 million due to the
      amortization of intangibles generated by new acquisitions and $6.2 million
      as a
      result of an increase in professional services relating to legal and the
      outsourcing of certain human resource functions.  We also terminated a
      cash settled forward starting interest rate swap (forward starting swap)
      resulting in a $6.2 million reduction of administrative
      expenses.  This forward starting swap is explained in more detail in
      the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below.

Net
      interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased $18.8 million
      from the prior fiscal year.  This increase was primarily a result of
      increased interest expense from higher debt outstanding as a result of our
      share
      buybacks.

Income
      before income tax was $533.6 million, a 3.0% increase over fiscal
      2006.  Income before income tax from the Rentals segment decreased
      0.1% over the prior year due to higher selling expenses associated with the
      reorganization of the sales force and higher delivery labor primarily as a
      result of our restroom cleaning service.  Income before income tax for
      the Other Services segment increased 45.7% from the prior year mainly due to
      increased revenue and cost containment initiatives.

Cintas'
      effective tax rate was 37.3% for fiscal 2007, as compared to 37.6% for fiscal
      2006 (see also Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements”).

Net
      income for fiscal 2007 of $334.5 million was a 3.4% increase over fiscal 2006,
      and diluted earnings per share of $2.09 was an 8.9% increase over fiscal
      2006.  The increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the
      increase in net income due to the impact of the share buyback program, which
      is
      discussed in more detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section
      below.  Return on average equity was 15.7% in fiscal 2007 and 15.4% in
      fiscal 2006.  Return on average equity is computed as net income
      divided by the average of shareholders’ equity.


We
      believe that this calculation gives management and shareholders a good
      indication of Cintas’ historical performance.

, using the modified-retrospective method.  See the
      Stock-based compensation section below within Critical Accounting Policies
      for
      further information.

Fiscal
      2006 total revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 11.0% over fiscal
      2005.  Internal growth improved in fiscal 2006 to 7.8%, up from 6.3%
      in fiscal 2005.  Our internal growth continues to be generated mainly
      through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and
      the
      increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer
      base.  The remaining growth in total revenue was generated
      predominantly through acquisitions of rental, first aid, safety and fire
      protection service businesses and document management
      businesses.  Information related to acquisitions is discussed in Note
      8 entitled Acquisitions of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.”

Rentals
      segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental
      of
      corporate identity uniforms and other garments, and the rental and/or sale
      of
      mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental
      services.  Revenue from the Rentals segment increased 8.7% over fiscal
      2005.  The increase in Rentals segment revenue was primarily due to
      growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary
      products into our existing customer base.  New business remained
      healthy as we experienced continued success in selling rental programs to new
      customers.  We also continued to expand our rental market, with over
      half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users
      of uniform rental programs.  Internal revenue growth for the Rentals
      segment was 7.3% in fiscal 2006 compared to 6.8% in fiscal 2005.  We
      estimate that the effects of hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma negatively
      impacted our Rentals segment internal growth rate by approximately
      0.3%.  The 1.4% of remaining growth in fiscal 2006 resulted from the
      acquisition of rental volume.

Other
      Services segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design, manufacture
      and direct sale of uniforms and related items, first aid, safety and fire
      protection products and services, document management services and branded
      promotional products.  Other Services segment revenue increased 18.6%
      over fiscal 2005, primarily due to acquisitions of first aid, safety and fire
      protection businesses and document management businesses.

Internal
      revenue in the Other Services segment increased 9.6% over fiscal
      2005.  This increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of
      first aid, safety and fire protection products and services and document
      management services.  We estimate that the effects of hurricanes
      Katrina, Rita and Wilma negatively impacted our Other Services segment internal
      growth rate by approximately 0.4%.  Growth in the Other Services
      segment continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through
      further penetration of additional products and services into our existing
      customer base.

Cost
      of
      rentals increased 8.6% over fiscal 2005.  Cost of rentals consists
      primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of
      in
      service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other rental
      items.  The cost increase over fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by the
      growth in Rentals segment revenues.  However, rising energy costs also
      contributed to this increase.  Rentals segment energy costs increased
      31.7% in fiscal 2006, from $77.6 million in fiscal 2005 to $102.2 million in
      fiscal 2006.  Various cost containment initiatives implemented
      throughout the year helped offset the significant increase in energy
      costs.  As a result, cost of rentals as of percent of Rentals segment
      revenues remained at 54.8% in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.

Increases
      in energy costs will continue to impact our results of operations negatively
      in
      coming quarters, except to the extent we are able to offset such costs with
      price increases and increased operating efficiencies.  Our New Orleans
      rental operation and Gulf Coast direct sale business continue to be impacted
      negatively by hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.  While physical
      damage to our facilities was minimal, many of our customers in the region have
      yet to reopen or to return to pre-hurricane staffing levels.  This
      lower business volume will continue to have an impact on our
      results.  We are actively pursuing recoupment of our losses related to
      these hurricanes with our insurance carrier.  We do not yet have a
      clear indication of when a recoupment agreement will be resolved, nor can we
      be
      sure of the amount we will receive.


Cost
      of
      other services increased 16.2% over fiscal 2005.  Cost of other
      services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and
      first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses.  The
      increase over fiscal 2005 was due to the growth in Other Services segment
      revenue, derived through a combination of internal growth and
      acquisitions.  Gross margin within this segment may fluctuate
      depending on the type of product or service sold, as more cost efficient
      sourcing is employed and as products which require additional services or
      specialization generate higher gross margins.  For example, tailored
      garments that incorporate high levels of design and customization tend to
      generate higher gross margins than work wear and standard catalog
      items.  The gross margin for fiscal 2006 is 35.1%.  The
      gross margin for the Other Services segment has historically been in the 30%
      to
      35% range.  However, Six Sigma and other cost containment initiatives
      have allowed us to exceed this historical range.  Due to the success
      of these initiatives and our continued efforts, we believe the future gross
      margins will be in the 32% to 37% range.

Selling
      and administrative expenses increased 11.4% over fiscal 2005.  Selling
      and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling
      expenses.  In order to accelerate revenue growth, we have increased
      our sales force, marketing plans and sales promotions.  These measures
      combined to increase our selling costs by $24.0 million over the prior fiscal
      year.  The cost of providing medical and retirement benefits to our
      employees increased $17.0 million, representing a 13.9% increase over the prior
      year.  In addition, administrative expenses increased by $4.7 million
      as a result of an increase in the bad debt reserve and by $11.8 million as
      a
      result of an increase in professional services relating to legal and the
      outsourcing of certain human resource functions.  Administrative
      expenses also increased by $5.2 million due to the amortization of intangibles
      generated by new acquisitions.

Net
      interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased $7.5 million
      from the prior fiscal year.  This increase in net interest expense is
      due to increased interest rates on our outstanding debt and the increased level
      of borrowing used to fund acquisitions and the stock buyback
      program.

Income
      before income tax was $518.0 million, a 10.4% increase over fiscal
      2005.  Income before income tax from the Rentals segment increased
      9.5% over the prior year due to higher rental revenue and various cost
      containment initiatives, which offset the increases in selling expenses, medical
      and energy costs.  Income before income tax for the Other Services
      segment increased 27.0% from the prior year mainly due to increased revenue
      and
      cost containment initiatives.

Cintas'
      effective tax rate was 37.6% for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 (see also
      Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements”).

Net
      income for fiscal 2006 of $323.4 million was a 10.5% increase over fiscal 2005,
      and diluted earnings per share of $1.92 was a 13.6% increase over fiscal
      2005.  The increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the
      increase in net income due to the impact of the share buyback program, which
      is
      discussed in more detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section
      below.  Return on average equity was 15.4% in fiscal 2006 and 14.7% in
      fiscal 2005.  Return on average equity is computed as net income
      divided by the average of shareholders’ equity.  We believe that this
      calculation gives management and shareholders a good indication of Cintas’
historical performance.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

At
      May
      31, 2007, Cintas had $155.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities, representing a decrease of $86.0 million from May 31, 2006, or
      35.6%.  This decrease is primarily due to acquisitions and the share
      buyback program.  Cash generated from operations was $449.4 million in
      fiscal 2007 as compared to $461.0 million generated in fiscal
      2006.  This $11.6 million decrease was primarily due to increased
      inventory levels and increased taxes paid, offset by increased net income and
      lower rental items in service.  Significant uses of cash in fiscal
      2007 were capital expenditures of $180.8 million, acquisitions of $160.7 million
      (net of cash acquired), repurchases of common stock of $198.9 million and
      dividends of $62.0 million.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities will be used to finance future acquisitions, capital expenditures,
      expansion and share buybacks.

Marketable
      securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government
      securities.  Cintas' investment policy pertaining to marketable
      securities is conservative.  The criteria used in making investment
      decisions is the preservation of principal, while earning an attractive
      yield.

Accounts
      receivable increased $19.0 million, primarily due to increased
      revenues.  The average collection period in fiscal 2007 remained
      comparable with fiscal 2006.


Inventories
      increased $33.7 million, or 17.0%.  Inventory levels at May 31, 2006,
      were relatively low due to strong uniform sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal
      2006.  The increase in inventory from May 31, 2006 to May 31, 2007,
      reflects a replenishment of inventory to more normalized levels.

Working
      capital decreased $14.0 million to $753.7 million in fiscal
      2007.  This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in marketable
      securities for the execution of the share buyback program.

Net
      property and equipment increased by $56.5 million due to continued investment
      in
      rental facilities and equipment and real estate purchased in conjunction with
      the acquisitions of rental, first aid, safety and fire protection and document
      management businesses.  Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 totaled
      $180.8 million, including $132.8 million for the Rentals segment and $48.0
      million for the Other Services segment, exceeding depreciation expense by
      approximately $45.6 million.  Cintas continues to reinvest in land,
      buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future
      growth.  During the year, Cintas completed construction of two new
      uniform rental facilities and has an additional five uniform rental facilities
      in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental
      operations.  Cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal
      2008 will be between $170.0 and $190.0 million.

Long-term
      debt totaled $877.1 million at May 31, 2007.  This amount includes
      $225.0 million in long-term debt due on June 1, 2007, that was refinanced
      effective June 1, 2007, under Cintas’ existing commercial paper
      program.  Long-term debt also includes $225.0 million of ten-year
      senior notes at a rate of 6.0% which was borrowed in order to finance the Omni
      acquisition in fiscal 2002 and $250.0 million of thirty-year senior notes issued
      in August 2006 at a rate of 6.15%.  Proceeds from the thirty-year
      senior notes issuance were used to extinguish outstanding commercial paper
      at
      the time of that debt issuance.  Cintas has earned credit ratings on
      these notes of “A” from Standard & Poor’s and “A2” from Moody’s. In
      addition, long-term debt also includes $168.0 million in commercial paper.
      Cintas utilizes a $600.0 million commercial paper program, on which it has
      earned credit ratings of “A-1” from Standard & Poor’s and “Prime-1” from
      Moody’s.  We believe these ratings are reflective of our commitment to
      conservative financial policies, strong financial management and a disciplined
      integration strategy for acquisitions. The commercial paper program is fully
      supported by a long-term credit facility that matures in fiscal
      2011.

During
      the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Cintas entered into a forward starting swap
      to
      protect forecasted interest payments from interest rate movement in anticipation
      of a $200.0 million, 30-year debt issuance in early fiscal
      2008.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Cintas changed its
      intent on issuing this 30-year debt.  This decision was based on
      current market conditions and interest rate environment as well as the
      additional payment flexibility provided to Cintas under its commercial paper
      program.  As a result of this decision, Cintas terminated the forward
      starting swap and recorded the resulting $6.2 million gain in fiscal 2007 as
      a
      reduction of administrative expenses.

Cintas’
      total debt to capitalization ratio has increased from 27.6% at May 31, 2006,
      to
      28.9% at May 31, 2007. Total debt increased $82.4 million in fiscal 2007 through
      the net activity of debt issuance noted above (see Note 5 entitled Long-Term
      Debt and Note 8 entitled Acquisitions of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements”).  This additional indebtedness was used to execute the
      share buyback program. During fiscal 2007, Cintas bought back $198.9 million
      of
      Cintas stock.

During
      the year, Cintas paid dividends of $62.0 million, or $0.39 per
      share.  On a per share basis, this dividend is an increase of 11.4%
      over the dividend paid in fiscal 2006.  This marks the 24

th

consecutive
      year
      that Cintas has increased its annual dividend since going public in
      1983.

On
      May 2,
      2005, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million
      stock buyback program at market prices.  In July 2006, Cintas
      announced that the Board of Directors approved the expansion of its share
      buyback program by an additional $500.0 million.  During fiscal 2007,
      Cintas purchased 4.8 million shares of Cintas stock at an average price of
      $41.38 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $198.9
      million.  From the inception of the stock buyback program through July
      27, 2007, Cintas has purchased 14.2 million shares of Cintas stock at an average
      price of $40.89 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $580.6
      million.  The Board of Directors did not specify an expiration date
      for this program.


Following
      is information regarding Cintas' long-term contractual obligations and other
      commitments outstanding as of May 31, 2007:

Long-Term
      Contractual Obligations

Cintas
      also makes payments to defined contribution plans.  The amounts of
      contributions made to the plans are made at the discretion of
      Cintas.  Future contributions are expected to increase 10%
      annually.  Assuming this 10% increase, payments due in one year or
      less would be $31,986, two to three years would be $73,887 and four to five
      years would be $89,404.  Payments for years thereafter are expected to
      continue increasing by 10% each year.

(1)

Long-term
                debt primarily consists of $700,000 in long-term notes and $168,000
                in
                commercial paper.  Reference Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of
                “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a detailed discussion of
                long-term debt.

Capital
                lease obligations are included in long-term debt detailed in Note
                entitled Long-Term Debt of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
                Statements.”

(3)

Operating
                leases consist primarily of building leases and a synthetic lease
                on a
                corporate jet.

(4)

Interest
                payments include interest on both fixed and variable rate
                debt.  Rates have been assumed to increase 25 basis points for
                fiscal 2008, an additional 25 basis points in fiscal 2009 and then
                remain
                constant in future years.

                compensation and general liability insurance
                programs.

Cintas
      has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the synthetic lease on a
      corporate jet.  The synthetic lease on the aircraft does not currently
      have, and is not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect
      on Cintas’ financial condition, changes in Cintas’ financial condition, revenues
      or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
      resources.


Inflation
      and Changing Prices

Changes
      in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact
      Cintas’ financial results.  Medical benefits and energy costs, in
      particular, continue to rise.  Medical benefit costs have increased
      due to a combination of rising healthcare costs and an increase in the number
      of
      covered participants.  Medical benefits were 3.4% of total revenues in
      fiscal 2007 and 3.2% of total revenues in fiscal 2006.  Energy costs
      were 3.3% of total revenues in fiscal 2007 and 3.4% of total revenues in fiscal
      2006.

Management
      believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas' financial condition
      or a negative impact on operations.

Litigation
      and Other Contingencies

Cintas
      is
      subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of
      its
      business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and
      employment claims.  In the opinion of management, the aggregate
      liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions,
      will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results
      of
      operations of Cintas.  Cintas is party to additional litigation not
      considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation
      discussed below.

Cintas
      is
      a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Paul Veliz, et al. v.
      Cintas Corporation

, filed on March 19, 2003, in the United States District
      Court, Northern District of California, Oakland Division, alleging that Cintas
      violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service
      sales representatives, whom Cintas considers exempt employees, and asserting
      additional related ERISA claims.  On August 23, 2005, an amended
      complaint was filed alleging additional state law wage and hour claims under
      the
      following state laws: Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,
      Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
      Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.  The plaintiffs are seeking
      unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief or both.  Cintas
      denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’ allegations.  On
      February 14, 2006, the court ordered a majority of the opt-in plaintiffs to
      arbitrate their claims in accordance with the terms of their Cintas employment
      agreement.  On February 14, 2006, the court also permitted plaintiffs
      to file a second amended complaint alleging state law claims in the 15 states
      listed above only with respect to the putative class members that may litigate
      their claims in court.  No determination has been made by the court or
      an arbitrator regarding class certification.  There can be no
      assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified,
      as to the geographic or other scope of such class.  If a court or
      arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict
      on
      the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the
      resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing
      basis
      could be material to Cintas.  Any estimated liability relating to this
      lawsuit is not determinable at this time.

Cintas
      also is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Mirna E. Serrano,
      et al. v. Cintas Corporation

, filed on May 10, 2004, and pending in the
      United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division
      (

Serrano

).

Serrano

alleges that Cintas
      discriminated against women in hiring into various service sales representative
      positions across all divisions of Cintas throughout the United
      States.  On November 15, 2005, the Equal Employment Opportunity
      Commission (EEOC) intervened in the

Serrano

lawsuit.  The

Serrano

plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages,
      punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other remedies.  Cintas is a
      defendant in another purported class action lawsuit,

Nelly Blanca Avalos, et
      al. v. Cintas Corporation

, currently pending in the United States District
      Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division
      (

Avalos

).

Avalos

alleges that Cintas discriminated
      against women, African-Americans and Hispanics in hiring into various service
      sales representative  positions in Cintas’ Rental division only
      throughout the United States.  On April 27, 2005, the EEOC intervened
      in the claims asserted in

Avalos

.  The

Avalos

plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages,
      attorneys’ fees and other remedies.  The claims in

Avalos

originally were brought in the previously disclosed lawsuit captioned

Robert
      Ramirez, et al. v. Cintas Corporation

, filed on January 20, 2004, in the
      United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco
      Division (

Ramirez

).  On May 11, 2006, however, those claims
      were severed from

Ramirez

and transferred to the Eastern District of
      Michigan, Southern Division, where the case was re-named

Avalos

.  On July 10, 2006,

Avalos

and

Serrano

were consolidated for all pretrial purposes,
      including
      proceedings on class certification.  The consolidated case is known as

Mirna E. Serrano/Blanca Nelly Avalos, et al. v. Cintas Corporation

, and
      remains pending in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
      Michigan, Southern Division.  No filings or determinations have been
      made in

Serrano/Avalos

as to class certification.  There can
      be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is
      certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class.  The
      non-service sales representative hiring claims in the previously disclosed

Ramirez

case that have not been dismissed remain pending in the
      Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, but were ordered to
      arbitration and stayed pending the completion of arbitration.  The

Ramirez

purported class action claims currently in arbitration


include
      allegations that Cintas failed to promote Hispanics into supervisory positions,
      discriminated against African-Americans and Hispanics in service sales
      representative route assignments and discriminated against African-Americans
      in
      hourly pay in Cintas’ Rental division only throughout the United
      States.  The

Ramirez

plaintiffs seek injunctive relief,
      compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other
      remedies.  No filings or determinations have been made in

Ramirez

as to class certification.  There can be no assurance
      as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to
      the
      geographic or other scope of such class.  On February 24, 2006, a
      motion to intervene in

Serrano

was filed by intervening plaintiffs
      Colleen Grindle, et al., on behalf of a subclass of female employees at Cintas’
Perrysburg, Ohio rental location who allegedly were denied hire, promotion
      or
      transfer to service sales representative positions.  On March 24,
      2006, plaintiffs Colleen Grindle, et. al. withdrew their motion to intervene
      without prejudice.  On February 20, 2007, the plaintiffs Colleen
      Grindle, et. al. filed a separate lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas, Wood
      County, Ohio, captioned

Colleen Grindle, et al. v. Cintas Corporation

(

, on behalf of a class of female employees at Cintas’
Perrysburg, Ohio location who allegedly were denied hire,
      promotion or transfer
      to service sales representative positions on the basis of their
      gender.  The

Grindle

plaintiffs seek injunctive relief,
      compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other
      remedies.  No filings or determinations have been made in

Grindle

as to class certification.  There can be no assurance
      as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to
      the
      geographic or other scope of such class.  In addition, a class action
      lawsuit,

Larry Houston, et al. v. Cintas Corporation,

was filed on
      August 3, 2005, in the United States District Court for the Northern District
      of
      California on behalf of African-American managers alleging racial discrimination
      (

Houston)

.  On November 22, 2005, the court entered an order
      requiring the named plaintiffs in the

Houston

lawsuit to arbitrate all
      of their claims for monetary damages.  If there is an adverse verdict
      or a negotiated settlement of all or any of these actions, the resulting
      liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could
      be
      material to Cintas.  Any estimated liability relating to these
      proceedings is not determinable at this time.

Other
      similar administrative proceedings are pending including two charges filed
      on
      November 30, 2004, by an EEOC Commissioner with the EEOC Systemic Litigation
      Unit alleging:  (i) failure to hire and assign females to production
      job positions; and (ii) failure to hire females, African-Americans and Hispanics
      into the Management Trainee program.  The investigations of these
      allegations are pending and no determinations have been made.  On
      August 29, 2006, the EEOC Indianapolis District Office issued a dismissal and
      notice of rights and closed its file on the Clifton Cooper charge served on
      Cintas on March 23, 2005, by Cooper on behalf of himself and a similarly
      situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory
      pay and treatment due to race.  Mr. Cooper’s claims are now part of
      the

Houston

arbitration matter disclosed hereinabove.

Cintas
      is
      also a defendant in a lawsuit,

J. Lester Alexander, III vs. Cintas
      Corporation, et al

., which was originally filed on October 25, 2004, and is
      currently pending in the Circuit Court of Randolph County, Alabama.  The
      case was brought by J. Lester Alexander, III, the Chapter 7 Trustee (the
      Trustee) of Terry Manufacturing Company, Inc. (TMC) and Terry Uniform Company,
      LLC (TUC), against Cintas in Randolph County, Alabama.  The Trustee seeks
      damages against Cintas for allegedly breaching fiduciary duties to TMC and
      TUC
      and for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by others
      to
      those entities.  The complaint also includes allegations that Cintas
      breached certain limited liability company agreements, or alternatively,
      misrepresented its intention to perform its obligations in those agreements
      and
      acted as alter egos of the bankrupt TMC and is therefore liable for all of
      TMC's
      debts.  The Trustee is seeking $50 million in compensatory damages and $100
      million in punitive damages.  Cintas denies these claims and is vigorously
      defending itself against all claims in the complaint.   If there is an
      adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of
      this
      lawsuit, the resulting liability could be material to Cintas.  Any
      estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this
      time.

The
      litigation discussed above, if decided adversely to or settled by Cintas, may,
      individually or in the aggregate, result in liability material to Cintas’
financial condition or results of operations.  Cintas may enter into
      discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter
      into
      settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests
      of
      Cintas’ shareholders.

Cintas
      is
      subject to various environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies
      in
      the industry.  While environmental compliance is not a material
      component of our costs, Cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated
      operating costs, primarily for water treatment and waste removal, on a regular
      basis.  Environmental spending related to water treatment and waste
      removal was approximately $16 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal
      2006.  Capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances
      were approximately $2 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.  These
      expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems,
      which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years.  Cintas does
      not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a
      percent to revenue basis and is not aware of any material non-compliance with
      environmental laws.


New
      Accounting Standards

In
      July
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation
      No.
      48 (FIN 48),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, which
      clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition
      threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
      financial statements.  FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
      classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
      disclosure and transition.  This Interpretation is effective for fiscal
      years beginning after December 15, 2006.  Cintas will adopt this
      Interpretation on June 1, 2007, and is currently in the process of evaluating
      the impact of FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.  Any
      necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of
      adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our
      consolidated financial statements.

Critical
      Accounting Policies

The
      preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with
      U.S.
      generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
      and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the
      consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  These
      critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled
      Significant Accounting Policies of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.”  Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to
      any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material
      impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
      recognition

Rental
      revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue
      is
      recognized when either  services are performed or when products are
      shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer.

Allowance
      for doubtful accounts

Cintas
      establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts.  This allowance is an
      estimate based on historical rates of collectibility.  An
      uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning
      with
      a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account
      ages.  The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly
      between the Rentals and Other Services segments, because of differences in
      customers served and the nature of each segment.

Inventories

Inventories
      are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
      market.  Substantially all inventories represent finished
      goods.  Cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory
      turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory
      balances.  The judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory
      turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost
      or
      market.  Inventory obsolescence is determined by specific
      identification, as well as an estimate based on historical rates of
      obsolescence.

Uniforms
      and other rental items in service

Uniforms
      and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization,
      calculated using the straight-line method.  Uniforms in service (other
      than cleanroom and flame resistant garments) are amortized over their useful
      life of eighteen months.  Other rental items including shop towels,
      mats, cleanroom garments, flame resistant garments, linens and restroom
      dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from eight to
      forty-eight months.  The amortization rates used are based on industry
      experience, Cintas' experience and wear tests performed by
      Cintas.  These factors are critical to determining the amount of in
      service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial
      statements.

Property
      and equipment

Depreciation
      is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
      of
      the assets, which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings, five to
      twenty years for building improvements, three to ten years for equipment and
      two
      to five years for leasehold improvements.  When events or
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not
      be
      recoverable, the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) are


compared
      to the carrying amount of the assets.  If the estimated future cash flows
      are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is
      recorded.  The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value
      of the assets with their carrying amounts.  Fair value is determined
      by discounted cash flows or appraised values, as
      appropriate.  Long-lived assets that are held for disposal are
      reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less estimated
      costs related to disposition.

Goodwill
      and impairment

Goodwill,
      obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any
      impairment.  Cintas performs annual impairment tests by
      segment.  These tests include comparisons to current market values,
      where available, and discounted cash flow analyses.  Significant
      assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin
      improvement leveraged from such growth.  Based on the results of the
      impairment tests, Cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the
      years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Service
      contracts and other assets

Service
      contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting
      agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use
      of
      the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which
      are
      generally five to ten years.  Certain noncompete agreements, as well
      as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a
      discounted cash flow model.  The assumptions and judgments used in
      these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other
      factors.  Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible
      assets, actual results over time could vary from original
      estimates.  Impairment of service contracts and other assets is
      through specific identification.  No impairment has been recognized by
      Cintas for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Stock-based
      compensation

At
      May
      31, 2007, Cintas had an equity compensation plan, which is more fully described
      in Note 11 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.”  Prior to June 1, 2006, Cintas accounted for this plan
      under the intrinsic value method proscribed by APB Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related Interpretations,
      as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123 (FAS 123),

Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation

.  Effective June 1, 2006, Cintas adopted the fair
      value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R) (FAS 123(R)),

Share-Based Payment

, using the modified-retrospective transition
      method.  Under that transition method, all prior periods have been
      restated based on the amounts previously calculated in the pro forma footnote
      disclosures required by FAS 123.  FAS 123(R) requires all share-based
      payments to employees, including stock options, to be recognized as an expense
      in the consolidated statement of income based on their fair
      values.  Due to this restatement, Cintas’ income before income taxes
      and net income decreased by $3.8 million for the year ended May 31, 2006, and
      $8.0 million for the year ended May 31, 2005.  This adoption lowered
      basic earnings per share from $1.95 per share to $1.93 per share for fiscal
      and from $1.75 per share to $1.70 per share for fiscal 2005.  In
      addition, diluted earnings per share were lowered from $1.94 per share to $1.92
      per share for fiscal 2006 and from $1.74 per share to $1.69 per share for fiscal
      2005.  The cumulative effect of the change on paid-in-capital and
      retained earnings as of June 1, 2005, was $21,241 and ($39,567),
      respectively.  The cumulative effect of the change on deferred taxes as of
      June 1, 2005, was less than $1million.

As
      a
      result of adopting FAS 123(R) on June 1, 2006, Cintas’ income before income
      taxes and net income for the year ended May 31, 2007, are $4.5 million and
      $3.1
      million lower, respectively, than if Cintas had continued to account for
      share-based compensation under APB 25.  Basic and diluted earnings per
      share are both $.02 lower for the year ended May 31, 2007, than if Cintas had
      continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25.

Litigation
      and environmental matters

Cintas
      is
      subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising
      from the ordinary course of business.  U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded
      when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the
      liability can be reasonably estimated.  Significant judgment is
      required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to
      be
      recorded.  Cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all
      of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent
      liability is recorded.  While a significant change in assumptions and
      judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent
      liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse
      effect on the consolidated financial statements.


A
        detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section
        entitled Litigation and Other Contingencies.

Income
      taxes

Deferred
      tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the
      consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets
      and liabilities.  Please reference Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for the types of items that give
      rise to significant deferred income tax assets and
      liabilities.  Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or
      liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for
      financial reporting purposes.  Deferred income taxes that are not
      related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified
      according to the expected reversal date.  Cintas regularly reviews
      deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable
      income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary
      differences.  As a result of this review, Cintas has not established a
      valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.

Cintas
      is
      periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the
      amount of taxes due.  These reviews include questions regarding the
      timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various
      tax
      jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various
      filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed
      appropriate.  Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions,
      Cintas believes its accruals are appropriate.

Outlook

Our
      outlook is positive for fiscal 2008.  In fiscal 2007, we reorganized
      our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive.  Although
      this reorganization has taken longer and been more costly than anticipated,
      we
      expect to see revenue growth benefits in fiscal 2008 and continued benefit
      over
      the long-term.  We will continue searching out additional products and
      services to become an even more valuable resource for our
      customers.  We believe that the high level of customer service
      provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure, quality products,
      financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business
      success.  As such, we see upside potential for all of our business
      units.  Although difficult to predict, we anticipate continued growth
      in all of our business units.

In
      the
      marketplace, competition and related pricing pressure will continue; however,
      we
      believe cost containment initiatives, technological advances and continued
      leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact.

When
      appropriate opportunities arise, we will supplement our internal growth with
      strategic acquisitions.

Like
      most
      other companies, we experienced, and anticipate continuing to experience,
      increased costs for wages and benefits, including medical
      benefits.  Changes in energy costs and changes in federal and state
      tax laws also impact our results.

Cintas
      continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by Unite Here
      and the Teamsters unions.  These unions are attempting to pressure
      Cintas into surrendering our employees' rights to a government-supervised
      election and unilaterally accept union representation.  Cintas'
      philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward:  We believe that
      employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom
      to
      say no.  This campaign could be materially disruptive to our business
      and could materially adversely affect results of operations.  We will
      continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees'
      rights.


Item
      7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure

About
      Market Risk

Cintas
      manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate
      debt and investing in marketable securities.  Earnings are affected by
      changes in short-term interest rates due to the use of commercial paper of
      approximately $168 million, with an average interest rate of
      5.28%.  This exposure is limited by the investment in marketable
      securities, which act as a hedge against variability in short-term
      rates.  If short-term rates change by one-half percent (or 50 basis
      points), Cintas' income before income taxes would change by approximately $2
      million.  This estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of
      marketable securities on the change in the cost of variable rate
      debt.  This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in
      economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.

Through
      its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency
      risk.  Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated
      in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated
      revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars.  The primary foreign
      currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.  Cintas
      does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses
      in
      earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate
      movements.

Management’s
      Report on

Internal
      Control over Financial Reporting

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To
      the
      Shareholders of Cintas Corporation:

Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f)
      under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to provide reasonable assurance
      regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
      financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Accordingly, even an
      effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide
      only
      reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
      preparation.

With
      the
      supervision of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
      Officer, management assessed our internal control over financial reporting
      as of
      May 31, 2007. Management based its assessment on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
      Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
      (COSO).  Management's assessment included evaluation of such elements
      as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls,
      process documentation, accounting policies and our overall control environment.
      This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our internal
      audit function.

Based
      on
      our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over
      financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2007, to provide reasonable
      assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
      of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

We
      reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of
      our
      Board of Directors. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting
      firm, Ernst & Young LLP, audited management's assessment and independently
      assessed the effectiveness of Cintas Corporation’s internal control over
      financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an attestation report,
      which is included in this Annual Report.


Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cintas Corporation:

We
      have
      audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
      Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Cintas Corporation
      maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
      2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
      Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
      Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Cintas Corporation’s management is
      responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
      and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
      reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
      assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
      over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
      of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
      become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
      compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management’s assessment that Cintas Corporation maintained effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2007, is fairly stated,
      in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.  Also, in our
      opinion, Cintas Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2007, based
      on

the COSO criteria

      Corporation as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements
      of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
      the period ended May 31, 2007, of Cintas Corporation, and our report dated

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cintas Corporation:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cintas Corporation
      as of
      May 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
      shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
      ended May 31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of Cintas
      Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
      these financial statements based on our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
      that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
      the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
      examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
      in
      the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
      principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
      evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
      audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
      material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cintas Corporation
      at
      May 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
      cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2007, in
      conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As
      discussed in Note 1, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have
      been restated for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
      No.
      123(R),

Share-Based Payment,

in fiscal 2007, using the
      modified-retrospective transition method.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Cintas Corporation’s
      internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2007, based on criteria
      established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
      Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report
      dated July 27, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Significant
                Accounting Policies

Business
      description

.

Cintas Corporation
      (Cintas) provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of
      all
      types throughout the United States and Canada.  We are North America's
      leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales
      programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services,
      including entrance mats, restroom products and services, first aid, safety
      and
      fire protection products and services, document management services and branded
      promotional products.  Our products and services are designed to
      enhance our customers’ images and to provide additional safety and protection in
      the workplace.

Cintas
      classifies its businesses into two operating segments, Rentals and Other
      Services, based on the similar economic and organizational characteristics
      of
      the products and services within each segment. The Rentals segment reflects
      the
      rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops and shop
      towels.  In addition to these rental items, we also provide our
      restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment.  The
      Other Services segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related
      items, first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document
      management services and branded promotional products.  Both segments
      provide these products and services throughout the United States and Canada
      to
      businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to
      major corporations that employ thousands of people.

Principles
      of consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements
      include the accounts of Cintas, controlled majority-owned subsidiaries and
      any
      entities that are not controlled but require consolidation in accordance with
      Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB
      No. 51

(collectively, Cintas or the Company).  Intercompany
      balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use
      of estimates.

The preparation of consolidated financial
      statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
      requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
      reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
      notes.  Financial results could differ from those
      estimates.

Revenue
      recognition.

Rental revenue is recognized when services are
      performed and other services revenue is recognized when either services are
      performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership
      pass
      to the customer.

Cost
      of rentals.

Cost of rentals consists primarily of production
      expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory,
      including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other rental items.  The
      Rentals segment inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs,
      inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs of distribution are included
      in the cost of rentals.

Cost
      of other services.

Cost of other services consists primarily
      of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery
      expenses and distribution expenses.  The Other Services segment
      inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs,
      warehousing costs and other costs of distribution are included in the cost
      of
      other services.

Selling
      and administrative expenses.

Selling and administrative
      expenses consist primarily of sales labor and commissions, management and
      administrative labor, payroll taxes, medical expense, insurance expense, legal
      and professional costs and amortization of intangible assets.

Cash
      and cash equivalents.

Cintas considers all highly liquid
      investments with a maturity of three months or less, at date of purchase, to
      be
      cash equivalents.

Marketable
      securities.

All marketable securities are comprised of debt
      securities and classified as available-for-sale.  The majority of
      these debt securities are obligations of state and political
      subdivisions.

Accounts
      receivable.

Accounts receivable is comprised of amounts owed
      through product shipments and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful
      accounts.  This allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of
      collectibility.  An uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for
      overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal


percentage
      and increasing substantially as the account ages.  The amount provided
      as the account ages will differ slightly between the Rentals and Other Services
      segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each
      segment.  When an account is considered uncollectible, it is written
      off against this allowance.

Inventories.

Inventories
      are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
      market.  Substantially all inventories represent finished
      goods.

Uniforms
      and other rental items in service.

These items are valued at
      cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line
      method.  Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant
      garments) are amortized over their useful life of eighteen
      months.  Other rental items including shop towels, mats, cleanroom
      garments, flame resistant garments, linens and restroom dispensers are amortized
      over their useful lives which range from eight to forty-eight
      months.

Property
      and equipment.

Property and equipment is stated at cost,
      less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is calculated using the
      straight-line method primarily over the following estimated useful lives, in
      years:

Buildings                                                                         30
      to 40

Building
      improvements                                                   5
      to 20

Equipment                                                                         3
      to 10

Leasehold
      improvements                                                2
      to   5

Long-lived
      assets.

When events or circumstances indicate that the
      carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated
      future cash flows (undiscounted) are compared to the carrying amount of the
      assets.  If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying
      amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded.  The impairment
      loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying
      amounts. Fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values,
      as appropriate.  Long-lived assets that are held for disposal are
      reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less estimated
      costs related to disposition.

Goodwill.

As
      required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142),

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

goodwill is separately disclosed
      from other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet and not
      amortized, but is tested for impairment on at least an annual
      basis.  Cintas completes an annual goodwill impairment test as
      required by FAS 142.  Based on the results of the impairment tests,
      Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the years
      ended May 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005.  Cintas will continue to perform
      future impairment tests as required by FAS 142 as of March 1 in future years
      or
      when indicators of impairment are noted.

Service
      contracts and other assets.

Service contracts and other
      assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained
      through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line
      method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally five
      to
      ten years.

Accrued
      liabilities.

Accrued liabilities consist primarily of
      insurance, medical and profit sharing obligations and legal and environmental
      contingencies.  These are recorded when it is probable that a
      liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
      estimated.

Stock-based
      compensation.

At May 31, 2007, Cintas had an equity
      compensation plan, which is more fully described in Note 11 entitled Stock-Based
      Compensation.  Prior to June 1, 2006, Cintas accounted for this plan
      under the intrinsic value method proscribed by APB Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related Interpretations,
      as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

.  Effective June 1,
      2006, Cintas adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (FAS 123(R)),

Share-Based
      Payment

, using the modified-retrospective transition
      method.  Under that transition method, all prior periods have been
      restated based on the amounts previously calculated in the pro forma footnote
      disclosures required by FAS 123.  FAS 123(R) requires all share-based
      payments to employees, including stock options, to be recognized as an expense
      in the consolidated statement of income based on their fair
      values.  Due to this restatement, Cintas’ income before income taxes
      and net income decreased by $3,796 for the year ended May 31, 2006, and $7,971
      for the year ended May 31, 2005.  This adoption lowered basic earnings
      per share from $1.95 per share to $1.93 per share for fiscal 2006 and from
      $1.75
      per share to $1.70 per share for fiscal 2005.  In addition, diluted
      earnings per share were lowered from $1.94 per share to $1.92 per share for
      fiscal 2006 and from $1.74 per share to $1.69 per share for fiscal
      2005.  The cumulative effect of the change on paid-in-capital and
      retained earnings as of June


1,
      2005,
      was $21,241 and ($39,567), respectively.  The cumulative effect of the
      change on deferred taxes as of June 1, 2005, was less than $1,000.

As
      a
      result of adopting FAS 123(R) on June 1, 2006, Cintas’ income before income
      taxes and net income for the year ended May 31, 2007, are $4,500 and $3,088
      lower, respectively, than if Cintas had continued to account for share-based
      compensation under APB 25.  Basic and diluted earnings per share are
      both $.02 lower for the year ended May 31, 2007, than if Cintas had continued
      to
      account for share-based compensation under APB 25.

Derivatives
      and hedging activities.

Derivatives and hedging activities
      are presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 133 (FAS 133),

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging
      Activities

, as amended.  This Standard requires the recognition of all
      derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and recognition
      of
      the resulting gains or losses as adjustments to earnings or other comprehensive
      income.

Cintas
      formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged
      items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
      various hedge transactions.  Cintas’ hedging activities are transacted only
      with highly rated institutions, reducing the exposure to credit risk in the
      event of nonperformance.

See
      Note
      5 entitled Long-Term Debt for further information on derivatives.

Fair
      value of financial instruments.

The following methods and
      assumptions were used by Cintas in estimating the fair value of financial
      instruments:

Cash
      and cash
      equivalents.

The amounts reported approximate market
      value.

Marketable
      securities.

The amounts reported are at market
      value.  Market values are based on quoted market prices.

Long-term
      debt.

The amounts reported are at a carrying value
      which approximates market value.  Market values are determined using
      similar debt instruments currently available to Cintas that are consistent
      with
      the terms, interest rates and maturities.

Reclassification.

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year
      presentation.

Other
      accounting pronouncements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued
      Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
      Taxes

, which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the
      minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
      recognized in the financial statements.  FIN 48 also provides guidance on
      derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
      periods, disclosure and transition.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
      beginning after December 15, 2006.  Cintas will adopt this
      Interpretation on June 1, 2007, and is currently in the process of evaluating
      the impact of FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.  Any
      necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of
      adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our
      consolidated financial statements.


2.

Marketable
                Securities

All
      marketable securities are comprised of debt securities and classified as
      available-for-sale.  Interest, realized gains and losses and declines
      in value determined to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities
      are included in interest income.  The cost of the securities sold is
      based on the specific identification method.

The
      following is a summary of marketable securities:

The
      gross
      realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $9, $3 and
      $23
      for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and the gross
      realized losses totaled $42, $219 and $19, respectively.  Net
      unrealized losses are $423 and $1,829 at May 31, 2007 and 2006,
      respectively.

Purchases
      of marketable securities were $30,829, $25,613 and $202,265 for the years ended
      May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
      cost
      and estimated fair value of debt securities at May 31, 2007, by contractual
      maturity, are $120,476 and $120,053, respectively.  All contractual
      maturities are due in one year or less.

3.

Property
                and Equipment

Interest
      expense is net of capitalized interest of $490, $384 and $749 for the years
      ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


4.

Goodwill,
                Service Contracts and Other
                Assets

Changes
      in the carrying amount of goodwill and service contracts for the years ended
      May
      31, 2007 and 2006, by segment, are as follows:

Information
      regarding Cintas' service contracts and other assets follows:

Amortization
      expense was $40,745, $33,536 and $28,362 for the years ended May 31, 2007,
      and 2005, respectively.  Estimated amortization expense, excluding any
      future acquisitions, for each of the next five years is $40,450, $37,732,
      $34,711, $30,966 and $24,902, respectively.


5.

Long-Term
                Debt

Debt
      in
      the amount of $5,201 is secured by assets with a carrying value of $5,616 at
      May 31, 2007.  Cintas has letters of credit outstanding at
      May 31, 2007, approximating $75,453.  Maturities of long-term debt
      during each of the next five years are $4,141, $1,235, $805, $393,729 and $762,
      respectively.

Interest
      paid, net of amount capitalized, was $45,805, $30,714 and $23,163 for the years
      ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Cintas
      has a commercial paper program supported by a $600,000 long-term credit
      facility.  This program was a $400,000 program during fiscal 2006, but was
      expanded to $600,000 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  As of
      May 31, 2007, there was $168,000 of commercial paper
      outstanding.

Long-term
      debt includes $225,000 due on June 1, 2007.  This debt was refinanced
      effective June 1, 2007, under Cintas’ existing commercial paper
      program.  The Cintas commercial paper program expires in fiscal
      2011.

On
      August
      15, 2006, Cintas issued $250,000 of senior notes due in 2036.  This
      debt bears an interest rate of 6.15% paid semi-annually beginning February
      15,
      2007.  The proceeds generated from the offering were used to repay a
      portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings at the time of this
      offering.

Cintas
      uses cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure of variability in short-term
      interest rates.  These agreements effectively convert a portion of the
      floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest
      rate changes on future interest expense. The effective portion of the net gain
      or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other
      comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or
      periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Gains
      or losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are charged to earnings in
      the
      current period.  When outstanding, the effectiveness of these
      derivative instruments is reviewed at least every fiscal
      quarter.  Examples of cash flow hedging instruments that Cintas may
      use are interest rate swaps, lock agreements and forward starting
      swaps.  There were no interest rate swap or lock agreements
      outstanding as of May 31, 2007.  There was also no cash settled
      forward starting swap outstanding as of May 31, 2007, as the forward starting
      swap that was in place at the end of the third quarter was terminated during
      May
      2007, as discussed below.

During
      the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Cintas entered into a forward starting swap
      to
      protect forecasted interest payments from interest rate movement in anticipation
      of a $200,000, 30-year debt issuance in early fiscal 2008.  During the
      fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Cintas changed its intent on issuing this 30-year
      debt.  This decision was based on current market conditions and
      interest rate environment as well as the additional payment flexibility provided
      to Cintas under its commercial paper program.  As a result of this
      decision, Cintas terminated the forward starting swap and recorded the resulting
      $6,200 gain in fiscal 2007 as a reduction to administrative
      expenses.

Cintas
      used interest rate lock agreements to hedge against movements in the treasury
      rates at the time Cintas issued its senior notes in fiscal 2002 and in fiscal
      2007.  The amortization of the cash flow hedges resulted in a credit
      to other comprehensive income of $384, $290 and $290 for the years ended May
      31,
      2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Cintas
      has certain significant covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants
      limit Cintas’ ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback
      transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of
      Cintas’ assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to
      capitalization and interest coverage ratios. Cross default provisions exist
      between certain debt instruments.


Cintas
      is
      in compliance with all of the significant debt covenants for all periods
      presented.  If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the
      default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness,
      impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas’ debt,
      net of cash and marketable securities, is $725,802 as of May 31,
      2007.  For fiscal 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was
      $449,391. Capital expenditures were $180,824 for the same period.

6.

Leases

Cintas
      conducts certain operations from leased facilities and leases certain
      equipment.  Most leases contain renewal options for periods from one
      to ten years.  The lease agreements provide for increases in rentals
      if the options are exercised based on increases in certain price level factors
      or other prearranged factors.  Step rent provisions, escalation
      clauses, capital improvements funding and other lease concessions are taken
      into
      account in computing minimum lease payments.  Minimum lease payments
      are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease
      term.  Lease payments are not dependent on an existing index or rate
      and are not included in minimum lease payments.  It is anticipated
      that expiring leases will be renewed or replaced.

The
      minimum rental payments under noncancelable lease arrangements for each of
      the
      next five years and thereafter are $22,352, $17,643, $12,988, $9,773, $5,658
      and
      $7,784, respectively.  Rent expense under operating leases during the
      years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, was $33,268, $30,136 and $25,280,
      respectively.

      reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United
      States.

Acquisitions

For
      all
      acquisitions accounted for as purchases, including insignificant acquisitions,
      the purchase price paid for each has been allocated to the fair value of the
      assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  During fiscal 2007, Cintas
      acquired 3 Rentals segment businesses and 29 Other Services segment
      businesses.  During fiscal 2006, Cintas acquired 9 Rentals segment
      businesses and 24 Other Services segment businesses.  The following
      summarizes the aggregate purchase price for all businesses
      acquired:

The
      results of operations for the acquired businesses are included in the
      consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition.  The
      pro forma revenue, net income and earnings per share information relating to
      acquired businesses are not presented because they are not
      significant.


9.

Defined
                      Contribution Plans

Cintas'
            Partners' Plan (the Plan) is a non-contributory profit sharing plan and
            ESOP for
            the benefit of substantially all U.S. Cintas employees who have completed
            one
            year of service.  The Plan also includes a 401(k) savings feature
            covering substantially all employees.  The amounts of contributions to
            the Plan and ESOP, as well as the matching contribution to the 401(k),
            are made
            at the discretion of Cintas.  Total contributions, including Cintas'
            matching contributions, which approximate cost, were $27,900, $26,500
            and
            $24,400 for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
            respectively.

Cintas
      also has a non-contributory deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP), which covers
      substantially all Canadian employees.  In addition, a registered
      retirement savings plan (RRSP) is offered to those employees.  The
      amounts of contributions to the DPSP, as well as the matching contribution
      to
      the RRSP, are made at the discretion of Cintas.  Total contributions,
      which approximate cost, were $1,239, $1,144 and $897 for the years ended
      May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

10.

Earnings
                per Share

Earnings
      per share are computed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share.

The basic
      computations are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding during each period.  The diluted computations reflect the
      potential dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised into common
      stock, under certain circumstances, that then would share in the earnings of
      Cintas.

The
      following table represents a reconciliation of the shares used to calculate
      basic and diluted earnings per share for the respective years:

      Policies.

11.

Stock-Based
                Compensation

Under
      the
      2005 equity compensation plan adopted by Cintas in fiscal 2006, Cintas may
      grant
      officers and key employees equity compensation in the form of stock options,
      stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, performance
      awards and other stock unit awards up to an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares
      of
      Cintas' common stock.  The compensation cost charged against income
      was $4,500, $5,277 and $7,971 for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively.  The amount recorded in fiscal 2007 reflects a
      cumulative catch-up adjustment of $2,169 ($2,088 after tax), due to a change
      in
      the estimated forfeitures for certain existing stock option and restricted
      stock
      grants.  Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended May
      31, 2007, are both $.01 higher, respectively, due to this change in estimated
      forfeitures.  The total income tax


benefit
      recognized in the consolidated income statement for share-based compensation
      arrangements was $1,413, $552 and $0 for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006
      and
      2005, respectively.

Stock
      Options

Stock
      options are granted at the fair market value of the underlying common stock
      on
      the date of grant.  The option terms are determined by the
      Compensation Committee, but no stock option may be exercised later than ten
      years after the date of the grant.  The option awards generally have
      ten year terms with graded vesting in years five through ten based on continuous
      service during that period.  Cintas recognizes compensation expense
      for these options using the straight-line recognition method over the vesting
      period.

The
      fair
      value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
      option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The
      risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government issues with a remaining
      term
      equal to the expected life of the stock options. The determination of expected
      volatility is based on historical volatility of Cintas stock over the period
      commensurate with the expected term of stock options, as well as other relevant
      factors. The weighted average expected term was determined based on the
      historical employee exercise behavior of the options. The weighted-average
      fair
      value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $16.01,
      $20.95 and $19.80, respectively.

The
      information presented in the following table relates primarily to stock options
      granted and outstanding under either the plan adopted in fiscal 2006 or under
      previously adopted plans:


The
      intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2007 was
      $6,760.  The total cash received from employees as a result of
      employee stock option exercises for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and
      was $5,023, $7,680 and $4,622, respectively.

The
      fair value of stock options vested during fiscal
      2007 is $3,682.

The
      following table summarizes the information related to stock options outstanding
      at May 31, 2007:

At
      May
      31, 2007, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and
      exercisable was $7,023 and $4,896, respectively.

The
      weighted-average remaining contractual term of
      stock options exercisable is 3.5 years.

Restricted
      Stock Awards

Restricted
      stock awards will consist of Cintas’ common stock which is subject to such
      conditions, restrictions and limitations as the Compensation Committee
      determines to be appropriate.  The vesting period is generally three
      years after the grant date.  The recipient of restricted stock awards
      will have all rights of a shareholder of Cintas, including the right to vote
      and
      the right to receive cash dividends, during the vesting period.

The
      information presented in the following table relates to restricted stock awards
      granted and outstanding under the plan adopted in fiscal 2006:

The
      remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options
      and
      restricted stock at May 31, 2007, was approximately $40,014, and the
      weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is
      4.0
      years.

Cintas
      reserves shares of common stock to satisfy share option exercises and/or future
      restricted stock grants.  At May 31, 2007, 13,200,297 shares of common
      stock are reserved for future issuance under the 2005 plan.

Litigation
                  and Other
                  Contingencies

Cintas
        is
        subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course
        of its
        business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and
        employment claims.  In the opinion of management, the aggregate
        liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions,
        will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results
        of
        operations of Cintas.  Cintas is party to additional litigation not
        considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation
        discussed below.

Cintas
      is
      a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Paul Veliz, et al. v.
      Cintas Corporation

, filed on March 19, 2003, in the United States District
      Court, Northern District of California, Oakland Division, alleging that Cintas
      violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service
      sales representatives, whom Cintas considers exempt employees, and asserting
      additional related ERISA claims.  On August 23, 2005, an amended
      complaint was filed alleging additional state law wage and hour claims under
      the
      following state laws: Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,
      Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
      Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.  The plaintiffs are seeking
      unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief or both.  Cintas
      denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’ allegations.  On
      February 14, 2006, the court ordered a majority of the opt-in plaintiffs to
      arbitrate their claims in accordance with the terms of their Cintas employment
      agreement.  On February 14, 2006, the court also permitted plaintiffs
      to file a second amended complaint alleging state law claims in the 15 states
      listed above only with respect to the putative class members that may litigate
      their claims in court.  No determination has been made by the court or
      an arbitrator regarding class certification.  There can be no
      assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified,
      as to the geographic or other scope of such class.  If a court or
      arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict
      on
      the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the
      resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing
      basis
      could be material to Cintas.  Any estimated liability relating to this
      lawsuit is not determinable at this time.

Cintas
      also is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Mirna E. Serrano,
      et al. v. Cintas Corporation

, filed on May 10, 2004, and pending in the
      United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division
      (

Serrano

).

Serrano

alleges that Cintas
      discriminated against women in hiring into various service sales representative
      positions across all divisions of Cintas throughout the United
      States.  On November 15, 2005, the Equal Employment Opportunity
      Commission (EEOC) intervened in the

Serrano

lawsuit.  The

Serrano

plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages,
      punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other remedies.  Cintas is a
      defendant in another purported class action lawsuit,

Nelly Blanca Avalos, et
      al. v. Cintas Corporation

, currently pending in the United States District
      Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division
      (

Avalos

).

Avalos

alleges that Cintas discriminated
      against women, African-Americans and Hispanics in hiring into various service
      sales representative positions in Cintas’ Rental division only throughout the
      United States.  On April 27, 2005, the EEOC intervened in the claims
      asserted in

Avalos

.  The

Avalos

plaintiffs seek
      injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and
      other remedies.  The claims in

Avalos

originally were brought
      in the previously disclosed lawsuit captioned

Robert Ramirez, et al. v.
      Cintas Corporation

, filed on January 20, 2004, in the United States
      District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division
      (

Ramirez

).  On May 11, 2006, however, those claims were
      severed from

Ramirez

and transferred to the Eastern District of
      Michigan, Southern Division, where the case was re-named

Avalos

.  On July 10, 2006,

Avalos

and

Serrano

were consolidated for all pretrial purposes,
      including
      proceedings on class certification.  The consolidated case is known as

Mirna E. Serrano/Blanca Nelly Avalos, et al. v. Cintas Corporation

, and
      remains pending in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
      Michigan, Southern Division.  No filings or determinations have been
      made in

Serrano/Avalos

as to class certification.  There can
      be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is
      certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class.  The
      non-service sales representative hiring claims in the previously disclosed

Ramirez

case that have not been dismissed remain pending in the
      Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, but were ordered to
      arbitration and stayed pending the completion of arbitration.  The

Ramirez

purported class action claims currently in arbitration include
      allegations that Cintas failed to promote Hispanics into supervisory positions,
      discriminated against African-Americans and Hispanics in service sales
      representative route assignments and discriminated against African-Americans
      in
      hourly pay in Cintas’ Rental division only throughout the United
      States.  The

Ramirez

plaintiffs seek injunctive relief,
      compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other
      remedies.  No filings or determinations have been made in

Ramirez

as to class certification.  There can be no assurance
      as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to
      the
      geographic or other scope of such class.  On February 24, 2006, a
      motion to intervene in

Serrano

was filed by intervening plaintiffs
      Colleen Grindle, et al., on behalf of a subclass of female employees at Cintas’
Perrysburg, Ohio rental location who allegedly were denied hire, promotion
      or
      transfer to service sales representative positions.  On March 24,
      2006, the plaintiffs Colleen Grindle, et. al. withdrew their motion to intervene
      without prejudice.  On February 20, 2007, the plaintiffs Colleen
      Grindle,


et.
      al.
      filed a separate lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas,

Wood
      County, Ohio, captioned

Colleen Grindle, et al. v. Cintas Corporation
      (Grindle)

, on behalf of a class of female employees at Cintas’ Perrysburg,
      Ohio location who allegedly were denied hire, promotion or transfer to service
      sales representative positions on the basis of their gender.  The

Grindle

plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages,
      punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other remedies.  No filings or
      determinations have been made in

Grindle

as to class
      certification.  There can be no assurance as to whether a class will
      be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or other scope
      of
      such class.  In addition, a class action lawsuit,

Larry Houston,
      et al. v. Cintas Corporation,

was filed on August 3, 2005, in the United
      States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of

African-American managers alleging racial discrimination
      (

Houston

).  On November 22, 2005, the court entered an order
      requiring the named plaintiffs in the

Houston

lawsuit to arbitrate all
      of their claims for monetary damages.  If there is an adverse verdict
      or a negotiated settlement of all or any of these actions, the resulting
      liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could
      be
      material to Cintas.  Any estimated liability relating to these
      proceedings is not determinable at this time.

Other
      similar administrative proceedings are pending including two charges filed
      on
      November 30, 2004, by an EEOC Commissioner with the EEOC Systemic Litigation
      Unit alleging:  (i) failure to hire and assign females to production
      job positions; and (ii) failure to hire females, African-Americans and Hispanics
      into the Management Trainee program.  The investigations of these
      allegations are pending and no determinations have been made.  On
      August 29, 2006, the EEOC Indianapolis District Office issued a dismissal and
      notice of rights and closed its file on the Clifton Cooper charge served on
      Cintas on March 23, 2005, by Cooper on behalf of himself and a similarly
      situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory
      pay and treatment due to race.  Mr. Cooper’s claims are now part of
      the

Houston

arbitration matter disclosed hereinabove.

Cintas
      is
      also a defendant in a lawsuit,

J. Lester Alexander, III vs. Cintas
      Corporation, et al

., which was originally filed on October 25, 2004, and is
      currently pending in the Circuit Court of Randolph County, Alabama.  The
      case was brought by J. Lester Alexander, III, the Chapter 7 Trustee (the
      Trustee) of Terry Manufacturing Company, Inc. (TMC) and Terry Uniform Company,
      LLC (TUC), against Cintas in Randolph County, Alabama.  The Trustee seeks
      damages against Cintas for allegedly breaching fiduciary duties to TMC and
      TUC
      and for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by others
      to
      those entities.  The complaint also includes allegations that Cintas
      breached certain limited liability company agreements, or alternatively,
      misrepresented its intention to perform its obligations in those agreements
      and
      acted as alter egos of the bankrupt TMC and is therefore liable for all of
      TMC's
      debts.  The Trustee is seeking $50,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000
      in punitive damages.  Cintas denies these claims and is vigorously
      defending itself against all claims in the complaint.   If there is an
      adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of
      this
      lawsuit, the resulting liability could be material to Cintas.  Any
      estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this
      time.

The
      litigation discussed above, if decided adversely to or settled by Cintas, may,
      individually or in the aggregate, result in liability material to Cintas’
financial condition or results of operations.  Cintas may enter into
      discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter
      into
      settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests
      of
      Cintas’ shareholders.

13.

Segment
                Information

Cintas
      classifies its businesses into two operating segments, Rentals and Other
      Services, based on the similar economic and organizational characteristics
      of
      the products and services within each segment. The Rentals segment reflects
      the
      rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, mats, mops and shop
      towels.  In addition to these rental items, we also provide restroom
      and hygiene products and services within this segment.  The Other
      Services segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items,
      first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management
      services and branded promotional products.  Both segments provide
      these products and services throughout the United States and Canada to
      businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to
      major corporations that employ thousands of people.

Information
      as to the operations of Cintas' different segments is set forth below based

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
      Controls and Procedures

With
      the
      participation of Cintas’ management, including Cintas’ Chief Executive Officer
      and President, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Controllers, Cintas
      has evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
      1934) as of May 31, 2007.  Based on such evaluation, Cintas’
management, including Cintas’ Chief Executive Officer and President, Chief
      Financial Officer, General Counsel and Controllers, have concluded that Cintas’
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2007, in
      ensuring (i) information required to be disclosed by Cintas in the reports
      that
      it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
      and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and
      (ii) information required to be disclosed by Cintas in the reports that it
      files
      or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Cintas’
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
      or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
      decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal
      Control over Financial Reporting

There
      were no changes in Cintas’ internal control over financial reporting (as defined
      in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal
      quarter ended May 31, 2007, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
      likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
      See

      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Item 8 preceding Cintas’
