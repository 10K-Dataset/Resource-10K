FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe
harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements may be identified
by words such as estimates, anticipates, projects, plans, expects, intends,
believes, should and similar expressions and by the context in which they are
used.  Such statements are based upon
current expectations of Cintas and speak only as of the date made.  These statements are subject to various
risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to
differ from those set forth in this Annual Report.  Factors that might cause such a difference include the
possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs, lower sales volumes,
the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions, fluctuations in costs
of materials and labor, costs and possible effects of union organizing
activities, outcome of pending environmental matters, the initiation or outcome
of litigation, higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products and
the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service.  Cintas undertakes no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances arising
after the date on which they are made.


PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Cintas Corporation, a Washington
corporation, provides highly specialized services to businesses of all types
throughout North America.  Cintas
designs, manufactures, and implements corporate identity uniform programs, provides
entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid and safety
products and services and document management services for over 500,000
businesses.  Cintas was founded in 1968
by Richard T. Farmer, Chairman of the Board, when he left his family’s
industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an
exclusive new fabric.  In the early
1970’s, Cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business.

Cintas classifies its businesses into two
operating segments: Rentals and Other Services.  The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate
identity uniforms which it rents, along with other items, to its
customers.  The Other Services operating
segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to its
customers as well as the sale of ancillary services including restroom
supplies, first aid and safety products and services, document management
services and cleanroom supplies.

The rental markets served by Cintas are
highly fragmented and competition for this business varies at each of Cintas’
locations.  There are other companies in
the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those
of Cintas, although much of the competition consists of smaller local and
regional firms. In certain instances, local competitors may also have financial
resources comparable to those of Cintas in a particular market.  Cintas believes that the primary competitive
factors that affect its operations are product, quality, service, design and
price.

The service provided to the rental markets
served by Cintas principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as
well as providing ongoing uniform replacements as required to each
customer.  Cintas also offers ancillary
products which include the rental or sale of entrance mats, fender covers,
towels, mops, linen and restroom products and first aid and safety products and
services.

Due to its diverse customer base and average
account size, the loss of one account would not have a significant financial
impact on Cintas.  No individual
customer accounts for greater than one percent of Cintas’ total revenues.

In its sale of customized uniforms, Cintas
competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers.

Cintas operates fourteen manufacturing
facilities, which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform
needs.  Additional products are
purchased from numerous outside suppliers. Because of Cintas’ ability to
manufacture much of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not
have a significant impact on Cintas. 
Cintas purchases fabric, used in its manufacturing process, from several
suppliers.  Cintas is not aware of any
circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials.

Cintas does not anticipate any material
capital expenditures for environmental remediation that would have a material
effect on its financial condition. Cintas is not aware of any material
non-compliance with environmental laws.

At May 31, 2004, Cintas employed
approximately 28,300 employees of which approximately 570 were represented by
labor unions.  Cintas is currently the
target of a corporate unionization campaign by UNITE HERE and the Teamsters
unions.  These unions are attempting to
pressure Cintas into surrendering our employees’ rights to a
government-supervised election and unilaterally accept union
representation.  This is
unacceptable.  Cintas’ philosophy in
regard to unions is straightforward:  We
believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and
the freedom to say no.  This campaign
could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely
affect results of operations.  We will
continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights.  Cintas considers its relationships with its
employees to be satisfactory.

Cintas files annual and quarterly reports and
proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The public may copy these materials at the
SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20549 and may obtain further information
concerning the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330.  The SEC maintains an
internet site that


contains the same information regarding
Cintas that is filed electronically with the SEC.  The address of that site is: http://www.sec.gov.  Cintas’ Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments
to those reports are posted on its website, www.cintas.com, as soon as
practicable after filing with the SEC.

The following table sets forth the revenues
derived from each service segment provided by Cintas.

See Note 13 entitled Segment Information in
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

ITEM 2

.

PROPERTIES

Cintas occupies 351 facilities located in 260
cities, of which 165 facilities are leased for various terms ranging from
monthly to the year 2019.  Cintas
expects that it will be able to renew its leases on satisfactory terms. All
other properties are owned.  The
corporate offices provide centrally located administrative functions including
accounting, finance, marketing and computer system development and support.
Cintas operates processing plants that house administrative, sales and service
personnel and the necessary equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and
bulk items.  Branch operations provide
administrative, sales and service functions. Cintas operates seven distribution
facilities and has fourteen manufacturing plants.  Cintas also operates facilities that distribute first aid
products.  Cintas considers the
facilities it operates to be adequate for their intended use. Cintas owns or
leases 9,561 vehicles.

The following chart provides additional information
concerning Cintas’ facilities:


ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the
ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract,
environmental and employment claims.  In
the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to
such ordinary course of business actions, will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial position or results of operations of Cintas.  Cintas is party to additional litigation not
considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation
discussed below.

Cintas is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Paul Veliz,
et al., v. Cintas Corporation

, filed on March 19, 2003, in the
United States District Court, Northern District of California, Oakland
Division, alleging that Cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour
laws applicable to its service sales representatives, whom Cintas considers
exempt employees, and asserting additional related ERISA claims.  The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified
monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. 
Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’
allegations.  The court ordered arbitration
for all potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of four
narrowly defined exceptions.  As a
result, Cintas believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be
required to arbitrate their claims.  No
determination has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class
certification.  There can be no
assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified,
as to the geographic or other scope of such class.  If a court or arbitrator certifies a class in this action and
there is an adverse verdict on the merits, or in the event of a negotiated
settlement of the action, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of
operations on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas.  Any estimated liability relating to this
lawsuit is not determinable at this time.

Cintas is also a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Robert
Ramirez, et al., v. Cintas Corporation

, filed on January 20,
2004, and pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of
California, San Francisco Division.  The
case was brought on behalf of all past and present female, African-American and
Hispanic employees of Cintas and its subsidiaries.  The complaint alleges that Cintas has engaged in a pattern and
practice of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment, hiring,
promotions, transfers, job assignments and pay.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages,
punitive damages and attorney’s fees, among other things.  Cintas denies these claims and is defending
the plaintiffs’ allegations.  No filings
or determination has been made as to class certification.  There can be no assurance as to whether a
class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or
other scope of such class.  If a court
certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits,
or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the resulting
liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be
material to Cintas.  Any estimated
liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.

The litigation discussed above, if decided adversely to or settled by
Cintas, may result in liability material to Cintas’ financial condition or results
of operations.  Cintas may enter into
discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter
into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best
interests of Cintas’ shareholders.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS STRATEGY

We are North America’s leading provider of corporate identity uniforms
through rental and sales programs, as well as related business services,
including entrance mats, restroom products, first aid and safety products and
services, document management services and cleanroom services.  Our services are designed to enhance our
customers’ images and to provide additional safety and protection in the
workplace.

Our business strategy is to increase our market share of the uniform
rental and sales business in North America through the sale of new uniform
programs and to provide our customers with all of the products and services we
offer.  We will also continue to
identify additional product and service opportunities to provide to our current
and future customers.  Our long-term
goal is to provide a product or service to every business in North America.

To pursue this strategy, we focus on the development of a highly
talented and diverse team of employees (who we call partners) – a team that is
properly trained and motivated to service our customers.  We support our partners’ service efforts by
providing superior products with distinct competitive advantages and we embrace
technological advances.

Continuous cost containment and product and process innovation are
considered hallmarks of our organization. 
A more formalized approach in these areas was recently initiated when we
commenced a Six Sigma effort within Cintas. 
Six Sigma is an analytical process that assists companies in improving
quality and customer satisfaction while reducing cycle time and operating
costs.  We are pleased with our progress
in this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this
process will yield to Cintas.

We continue to leverage our size and core competencies to become a more
valued business service provider to our current and future customers.  We will also continue to supplement our
internal growth with strategic acquisitions and the cultivation of new
businesses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal 2004 marked the 35

th

consecutive year of
uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for Cintas.  In addition to achieving this milestone, Cintas experienced
healthy improvements in profitability, cash flow and balance sheet strength.
This was accomplished while finalizing the integration of the largest uniform
rental acquisition in Cintas’ history, Omni Services, Inc. (Omni).

Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals
and Other Services.  The Rentals
operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it
rents, along with other items, to its customers.  The Other Services operating segment involves the design,
manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers as well as the sale of
ancillary products and services.  These
ancillary products and services include restroom supplies, first aid and safety
products and services, document management services and cleanroom
supplies.  All of these services are
provided throughout the United States and Canada to businesses of all types -
from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that
employ thousands of people.


The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of
income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for
the periods indicated:

As evidenced above, our revenue growth has been consistent between our
reporting segments, with Rentals and Other Services each accounting for a
consistent percentage of revenue the past two fiscal years.  We have increased our gross margins in both
segments in fiscal 2004, while maintaining selling and administrative costs as
a percent of revenues.  This overall
income improvement occurred despite the soft economy that existed for much of
the year and the continued rise in fuel, wage and benefit costs.

FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003

Fiscal 2004 total revenue was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4.7% over
fiscal 2003.  This growth was achieved
despite the difficult economic environment that existed for much of the
year.  Internal growth for fiscal 2004,
when adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal
2003, was 3.0%.  Weakness in employment
numbers through the first half of our fiscal year directly affected our
business, mainly through reduced uniform wearers and usage of related products,
and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective.  As employment numbers strengthened over the
second half of the year, our internal growth rates improved.  Internal growth by quarter is shown in the
table below.  Internal growth
percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of work days, by
quarter and for the year, where applicable.


Historically, increases in our internal growth rate have lagged
employment growth levels as customers add individuals to existing rental or
sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs.  Our organic growth continues to be generated
mainly through the continued sale of new uniform rental programs and the
increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base.

The remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly
through acquisitions of first aid and safety service businesses and document
management businesses.

Rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues
derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms, mats, shop towels and
other rental services.  Revenue from the
Rentals segment increased 4.3%, when adjusted for the extra workday that
occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003.  Internal revenue growth for the Rentals segment was 4.2%,
adjusted for the additional workday. 
The amount of acquired rental volume was insignificant for the year
ending May 31, 2004.

The increase in Rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the
customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into
our existing customer base.  New
business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling
uniform rental programs to new customers. 
We continue to expand our rental market, with over half of our new
business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform
rental programs.  Rentals revenue growth
was mitigated by lost business and reductions in existing business attributable
to the sluggish economy, especially during the first half of the year.

Other Services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived
from the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and
the sale of other direct sale products and services.  Other direct sale products and services include restroom and
cleanroom supplies, first aid and safety products and services and document
management services.  Other Services
revenue increased 4.4%, when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, primarily due to acquisitions of first
aid and safety services and document management businesses.

Internal revenue in the Other Services segment, adjusted for the
additional workday in fiscal 2004, decreased by 1.3% for the year.  This decrease was mainly due to the
continued difficulty experienced by our uniform direct sale customers in the
hospitality and airline industries. 
Weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large
national account customers has continued to impact our direct sales effort.  Partially offsetting this internal revenue
decrease in uniform direct sale revenues were increased revenues from the sale
of first aid products and services and document management services.

Cost of rentals increased 4.2% over fiscal 2003.  Cost of rentals consists primarily of
production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service
inventory, including uniforms and other rental items.  The cost increase over fiscal 2003 was primarily driven by the
growth in Rentals segment revenues.  An
increase in fuel and energy costs and a rise in labor delivery costs also
contributed to this increase.  Further
assimilation of operations obtained through the Omni acquisition and various
cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year mitigated the
increased fuel, energy and delivery costs.

Cost of other services increased 2.8% over fiscal 2003.  Cost of other services consists primarily of
cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery
expenses and distribution expenses.  The
increase over fiscal 2003 was due to the growth in Other Services revenue,
derived predominantly through acquisitions. 
The increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage, thereby
providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services
revenue from 67% in fiscal 2003 to 66% in fiscal 2004.  Sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies and
other cost containment initiatives, including Six Sigma initiatives,
implemented throughout the year supported this reduction in cost of other
services as a percent to Other Services revenue.

Selling and administrative expenses increased 4.6% over fiscal 2003,
primarily due to increased revenues. 
The continued rise in medical costs and increased legal expenses
contributed to the increase.

Net interest expense decreased $6 million from the prior year.  This decrease was primarily a result of
lower debt outstanding.  Total
outstanding debt decreased $79 million from May 31, 2003 to May 31, 2004, as
cash from operations was used to reduce debt which had been incurred
predominantly during the acquisition of Omni in May 2002 (see the Liquidity and
Capital Resources section below and Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of

“Note to Consolidated Financial Statements”).


A write-off of a loan receivable from a garment manufacturer is
included in net income as a pre-tax charge of $4.3 million. Due to developments
concerning the supplier’s viability to remain as a going concern, the
collectibility of the receivable was doubtful. 
As such, the receivable was completely written off.

Pre-tax income was $432 million, a 9.2% increase over fiscal 2003.  Pre-tax income from the Rentals segment
increased 6.7% over the prior year due to higher rental revenue, increased
efficiencies obtained from the assimilation of operations obtained from the
Omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives.  Pre-tax income for the Other Services
segment increased 19.6% from the prior year, due to increased sales volume, the
continued leveraging of fixed costs and sourcing and cost containment
initiatives.

Cintas’ effective tax rate was 37% for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003
(see also Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of

“Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements”).

Net income for fiscal 2004 of $272 million was a 9% increase over
fiscal 2003 and diluted earnings per share of $1.58 was a 9% increase over
fiscal 2003.  Return on average equity
was 15% in fiscal 2004 and 16% in fiscal 2003.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $197
million in fiscal 2004, or 341%, primarily due to increased revenues, a
reduction in inventory levels and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in uniform
and other rental items in service levels. 
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance
future acquisitions, capital expenditures and expansion.  Marketable securities consist primarily of
municipal bonds and federal government securities.

Accounts receivable increased $7 million due to increased
revenues.  Aggressive collection efforts
provided for a lower sequential increase in accounts receivable as compared to
total revenue growth.

Inventories decreased $43 million due to improved processes and
management systems, including cycle time reductions and other process
improvements initiated primarily through our Six Sigma process.  The completion of the Omni product line
consolidation also contributed to this decrease in inventory levels.

Net property and equipment increased by $8 million due to real estate
purchased in conjunction with acquisitions of first aid and safety services and
document management businesses. 
Depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures by $4 million as
Cintas continued to consolidate operations obtained from the Omni acquisition
in May of 2002.  In addition, due to
excess plant capacity and a sluggish economy, Cintas slowed the pace of new
plant construction.  During the year,
Cintas completed construction of four new uniform rental facilities and has an
additional eight uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to
accommodate growth in rental operations.

Total debt decreased $79 million through repayment of certain debt
related to the purchase of Omni, net of the change in fair market value of the
debt (see Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”).  This significant debt reduction was possible
due to strong cash flows being generated by operations.

FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002

Fiscal 2003 marked the 34

th

year of uninterrupted growth for
Cintas.  Total revenue was $2.7 billion,
an increase of 18% over fiscal 2002. 
This growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that
existed throughout the year.  The
continued weakness in employment numbers directly affected our business, mainly
through reduced uniform wearers, and caused our internal growth rate to be
lower than our stated objective.  We
continued to grow organically in this environment, mainly through the continued
sale of new uniform rental programs.

Rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues
derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms, mats, shop towels and
other items through our Uniform Rental Division.  Revenue from the Rentals segment increased 20%, primarily due to
the acquisition of Omni in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and growth in the
customer base.  Despite slow economic
growth, internal growth in the Rentals segment, adjusted for one less workday
during fiscal 2003, averaged over 4% for the year.  New business remained healthy as we experienced continued success
in selling uniform


rental programs to new customers. 
We continue to expand our rental market, with over half of our new
business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform
rental programs.  Rentals revenue growth
was mitigated by increased lost business and reductions in existing business,
attributable to the current sluggish economy in the United States and the resulting
reduction in the work force.

Other Services operating segment revenues are derived from the design,
manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers, as well as the sale
of ancillary services including restroom supplies, first aid products and
services and cleanroom supplies.  Other
Services revenue increased 13%, primarily due to acquisitions made in late
fiscal 2002 and increased customer sales. 
Despite slow economic growth, internal growth in the Other Services
segment, adjusted for one less workday during fiscal 2003, averaged 2% for the
year.  Revenues from the sale of
ancillary services increased 11% for the year due to increased selling
efforts.  This growth was partially
offset by a 3% decrease in revenues from the direct sale of uniforms to our
customers.  This decrease was primarily
a result of continued weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases
by large national account customers. 
Revenue growth in Other Services was also mitigated by increased lost
business and reductions in existing business attributable to the current
sluggish economy in the United States and the resulting reduction in the work
force.

Cost of rentals increased 23% over fiscal 2002.  Cost of rentals consists primarily of
production expenses, delivery expenses and amortization of in service uniforms
and other rental items.  The cost
increase over fiscal 2002 was primarily driven by the growth in Rentals segment
revenues.  A rise in fuel and energy
costs as well as an increase in delivery costs associated with the Omni
acquisition (primarily due to expanded route geography and smaller route size)
also contributed to this increase.  Cost
containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated
the increased fuel, energy and delivery costs.

Cost of other services increased 9% over fiscal 2002.  Cost of other services consists primarily of
cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery
expenses and distribution expenses.  The
increase over fiscal 2002 was due to the growth in Other Services revenue,
derived primarily through acquisitions. 
The increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage, thereby
providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services
revenue from 70% in fiscal 2002 to 67% in fiscal 2003.  Cost containment initiatives implemented
throughout the year also supported this reduction in cost of other services as
a percent to Other Services revenue.

Selling and administrative expenses increased 20% over fiscal
2002.  This increase was primarily due
to increased revenues.  The continued
rise in medical costs and additional travel expenses also contributed to this
increase.  The increased travel expense
was a result of the Omni acquisition and related integration, as well as a
return to more normalized travel versus fiscal 2002, when travel expenses were
lower due to the impact of the events of September 11.  We also continue to invest heavily in our
selling process in order to provide for future growth.

Net interest expense increased $23 million from the prior year.  This increase was primarily a result of
interest on $450 million in long-term notes issued in late fiscal 2002 to
finance the Omni acquisition (see the Liquidity and Capital Resources
section below and Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”).

Pre-tax income was $396 million, a 7% increase over fiscal 2002.  Pre-tax income from the Rentals segment
increased 7% over the prior year, primarily due to the higher rental revenue.  Pre-tax income was negatively impacted by
assimilation costs associated with the Omni acquisition.  Pre-tax income for the Other Services
segment increased 84% from the prior year, due to increased sales volume and
related leveraging of fixed costs.  Cost
containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated
increased delivery, medical and fuel costs.

Cintas’ effective tax rate was 37% for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002
(see also Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”).

Net income for fiscal 2003 of $249 million was a 6% increase over
fiscal 2002 and diluted earnings per share of $1.45 was a 7% increase over
fiscal 2002.  Return on average equity
was 16% in fiscal 2003 and 18% in fiscal 2002.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $27
million in fiscal 2003, or 32% primarily due to repayment of outstanding
commercial paper.  Cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions,
capital expenditures and expansion.  Marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and
federal government securities.


Accounts receivable decreased $5 million due to increased collection
efforts given economic conditions.  Inventories
increased $35 million with additional levels needed to support customers
obtained through acquisitions, including Omni, and the conversion of Omni
customers to our product line. 
Additionally, Cintas is now manufacturing more products for our cleanroom
and flame resistant clothing customers.

Net property and equipment decreased by $1 million due to the excess of
depreciation over capital expenditures. 
Certain capital expenditures were delayed in fiscal 2003 given reduced
capacity requirements due to the sluggish economy.  In fiscal 2003, Cintas completed construction of six new uniform
rental facilities and had an additional six uniform rental facilities in
various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations.

Total debt decreased $159 million through repayment of certain debt
related to the purchase of Omni, net of the change in fair market value of the
debt (see Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”).  This significant debt reduction was possible
due to strong cash flows being generated by operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At May 31, 2004, Cintas had $254 million in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities, representing an increase of $197 million from May 31,
2003.  This increase is primarily due to
strong operational cash flows and a significant reduction in required inventory
levels.   Cash generated from operations
was $510 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to $331 million generated in fiscal
2003.  This $179 million increase was
primarily due to increased net income in fiscal 2004 and the significant
reduction in inventory levels.  In
fiscal 2003, inventory levels increased $35 million due to the acquisition of
Omni and the subsequent conversion of Omni customers to the Cintas product
line.  Additionally, Cintas began
manufacturing more products for cleanroom and flame resistant clothing
customers.  In fiscal 2004, inventory
levels have decreased by $43 million through significant process improvements,
including Six Sigma initiatives, and the consolidation of the Omni product
line.  Partially offsetting the
increased cash flow was cash used for acquisitions of $102 million.  Other significant uses of cash in fiscal
2004 were debt repayments of $69 million (adjusted for a $10 million change in
derivatives), capital expenditures of $113 million and dividends of $50
million.

Cintas’ investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is
conservative.  Preservation of
principal, while earning an attractive yield, is the criteria used in making
investment decisions.

Working capital increased $136 million to $709 million in fiscal
2004.  This increase is primarily the
result of increased cash and marketable securities partially offset by the
decrease in inventories discussed above.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 totaled $113 million, including
$94 million for the Rentals segment and $19 million for Other Services.  Cintas continues to reinvest in land,
buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth.  Cintas anticipates that capital expenditures
for fiscal 2005 will be between $130 and $150 million.

On May 13, 2002, Cintas completed the acquisition of Omni for
approximately $659 million.  This
acquisition, coupled with smaller acquisitions in both the Rentals and Other
Services segments, were financed with a combination of approximately $109
million in cash, $450 million in long-term notes, and approximately $100
million in commercial paper.  As a
result of this additional debt, the total debt to total capitalization ratio
was 34% at May 31, 2002.  Significant
debt repayments occurred in fiscal 2003 ($173 million) and fiscal 2004 ($69
million).  The total debt to total
capitalization ratio has decreased to 20% at May 31, 2004.

The $450 million in long-term notes consist of $225 million with
five-year maturities at a rate of 5.125% and $225 million with ten-year
maturities at a rate of 6%.  Cintas has
earned credit ratings on these notes of “A” from Standard & Poor’s and “A2”
from Moody’s.  Cintas also utilizes a
$300 million commercial paper program, on which it has earned credit ratings of
“A-1” from Standard & Poor’s and “Prime-1” from Moody’s.  These ratings reflect Cintas’ commitment to
conservative financial policies, strong financial management and a disciplined
integration strategy for acquisitions. 
The commercial paper program is fully supported by a long-term credit
facility that matures in 2009.  As of
May 31, 2004, there is no commercial paper outstanding.


During the year, Cintas paid dividends of $50 million, or $0.29 per
share.  On a per share basis, this
dividend is an increase of 7% over the dividend paid in fiscal 2003.

Following is information regarding Cintas’ long-term contractual
obligations and other commitments outstanding as of May 31, 2004:

INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Changes in wage, benefits and oil and fuel costs have the potential to
materially impact Cintas’ financial results. 
Medical benefit costs in particular continue to rise, increasing
approximately 18% annually over the last three fiscal years.  Medical benefits accounted for approximately
3% of total revenues in fiscal 2004.

Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas’
financial condition or a negative impact on operations.


LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the
ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract,
environmental and employment claims.  In
the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such
ordinary course of business actions, will not have a material adverse effect on
the financial position or results of operations of Cintas.  Cintas is party to additional litigation not
considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation
discussed below.

Cintas is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Paul Veliz,
et al., v. Cintas Corporation

, filed on March 19, 2003, in the
United States District Court, Northern District of California, Oakland
Division, alleging that Cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour
laws applicable to its service sales representatives, whom Cintas considers
exempt employees, and asserting additional related ERISA claims.  The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified
monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. 
Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’
allegations.  The court ordered
arbitration for all potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of
four narrowly defined exceptions.  As a
result, Cintas believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be
required to arbitrate their claims.  No
determination has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class
certification.  There can be no
assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified,
as to the geographic or other scope of such class.  If a court or arbitrator certifies a class in this action and
there is an adverse verdict on the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement
of the action, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations
on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas.  Any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not
determinable at this time.

Cintas is also a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit,

Robert Ramirez,
et al., v. Cintas Corporation

, filed on January 20, 2004, and
pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California,
San Francisco Division.  The case was
brought on behalf of all past and present female, African-American and Hispanic
employees of Cintas and its subsidiaries. 
The complaint alleges that Cintas has engaged in a pattern and practice
of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment, hiring,
promotions, transfers, job assignments and pay.  The complaint seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages,
punitive damages and attorney’s fees, among other things.  Cintas denies these claims and is defending
the plaintiffs’ allegations.  No filings
or determination has been made as to class certification.  There can be no assurance as to whether a
class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or
other scope of such class.  If a court
certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits,
or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the resulting
liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be
material to Cintas.  Any estimated
liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.

The litigation discussed above, if decided adversely to or settled by
Cintas, may result in liability material to Cintas’ financial condition or
results of operations.  Cintas may enter
into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may
enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best
interests of Cintas’ shareholders.

Cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations, as are
other companies in the industry.  While
costs related to environmental compliance are not a material component of the
cost of rentals, Cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated
operating costs for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis.  Environmental spending amounted to approximately
$12 million in fiscal 2004 and $12 million in fiscal 2003.  This spending includes labor and chemical
costs for water treatment, as well as costs for waste removal.  Capital expenditures to limit or monitor
hazardous substances were $3 million in fiscal 2004 and $3 million in fiscal 2003.  These expenditures were primarily related to
the purchase of water treatment systems.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

an

Interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51.

The
Interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise
absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the
entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership,
contractual or other financial interests in the entity.  Currently, entities are generally
consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest
through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity.  Cintas adopted this Interpretation on
July 1, 2003, with no material effect to its financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148),

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure.

This Statement amends FASB Statement No.
123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,

to provide alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation.  In addition,
this Statement amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.  Cintas continues to apply Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 for the method used to account for stock-based
employee compensation arrangements, where applicable, but has adopted the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 148.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of Cintas’ consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  These critical accounting policies should be
read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies in

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.  Significant changes, estimates or
assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could
possibly have a material impact on the financial statements.

Revenue recognition

Rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other
services revenue is recognized when products are shipped and the title and
risks of ownership pass to the customer. 
Cintas also establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts.  This allowance is an estimate based on historical
rates of collectibility.  An
uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning
with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account
ages.  The amount provided as the
account ages will differ slightly between the Rentals and Other Services
segments, because of differences in customers served and the nature of each
business segment.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market.  Substantially all inventories
represent finished goods.  Cintas
applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply
variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances.  The judgments and estimates used to
calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at
the lower of cost or market.  Inventory
obsolescence is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate
based on historical rates of obsolescence.

Uniforms and other rental items in service

Uniform and other rental items in service are valued at cost less
amortization, calculated using the straight-line method.  Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom
and flame resistant garments) are amortized over their useful life of eighteen
months.  Other rental items including
shop towels, mats, cleanroom garments, flame resistant garments, linens and restroom
dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to forty-eight
months.  The amortization rates used are
based on industry experience, Cintas’ experience and wear tests performed by
Cintas.  These factors are critical to
determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the
financial statements.


Property and equipment

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically thirty to forty years
for buildings, five to twenty years for building improvements, three to ten
years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements.  When events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated
future cash flows (undiscounted) are compared to the carrying amount of the
assets.  If the estimated future cash
flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is
recorded.  The impairment loss is
measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying
amounts.  Fair value is determined by
discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.  Long-lived assets that are held for disposal
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less
estimated costs related to disposition.

Goodwill and impairment

Goodwill, primarily obtained through
acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment.  Cintas performs an annual impairment
test.  Based on the results of the
impairment tests, Cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the
years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Service contracts and other assets

Service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of
noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of
businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated
lives of the agreements, which are generally five to ten years.  Certain noncompete agreements, as well as
all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a
discounted cash flow model.  The
assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows
and discount rates, among other factors. 
Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual
results over time could vary from original estimates.

Environmental and litigation

Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to
environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business.  U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is
probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be
reasonably estimated.  Significant
judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the
amount to be recorded.  Cintas regularly
consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and
circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded.  While a significant change in assumptions
and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for
contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a
material adverse effect on the financial statements.  A detailed discussion of litigation matters is included in Note
12 entitled Litigation and Environmental Matters of

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets
and liabilities.  Please reference Note
7 entitled Income Taxes of

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for the types of
items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and
liabilities.  Deferred income taxes are
classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related
asset or liability for financial reporting purposes.  Deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability
for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal
date.  Cintas regularly reviews deferred
tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences.  As a result of this review, Cintas has not
established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.

Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities
regarding the amount of taxes due. 
These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of
deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with
various filing positions, Cintas records reserves for probable exposures.  Based on Cintas’ evaluation of current tax
positions, Cintas believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures.


OUTLOOK

As we look forward to fiscal 2005, our outlook is positive, but
guarded.  The economy has been gaining
traction as employment figures strengthen. 
Our internal growth rates have been improving as well.  We see significant upside potential for all
of our business units, especially given our relatively low 9% market share of a
$31 billion estimated potential market. 
Although difficult to predict, we anticipate continued growth in all of
our business units.  Overall performance
will be largely driven by the continued recovery in the economy.

In the marketplace, competition and related pricing pressure will
continue; however, we believe cost containment initiatives, technological
advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any
impact.

When appropriate opportunities arise, we will supplement our internal
growth with strategic acquisitions.

Like most other companies, we experienced, and anticipate continuing to
experience, increased costs for wages and benefits, including medical
benefits.  Changes in oil and fuel costs
also have the potential to impact our results.

Cintas is currently the target of a corporate unionization campaign by
UNITE HERE and the Teamsters unions. 
These unions are attempting to pressure Cintas into surrendering our
employees’ rights to a government-supervised election and unilaterally accept
union representation.  This is
unacceptable.  Cintas’ philosophy in
regard to unions is straightforward:  We
believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and
the freedom to say no.  This campaign
could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely
affect results of operations.  We will
continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’
rights.

We believe that the high level of customer service provided by our
partners and supported by our infrastructure, quality products, financial
resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business
success.  However, a number of factors
influence future revenue, margins and profit which make forecasting difficult.

ITEM
7A

.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURE

ABOUT
MARKET RISK

Cintas manages interest rate risk by using a
combination of variable and fixed rate debt, marketable securities and interest
rate swap agreements.  Earnings are
affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to the use of variable
rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately $230
million, with an average interest rate of 2.63%.  This exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities
and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in short-term
rates.  If short-term rates change by
one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas’ income before taxes would change
by approximately $1.1 million.  This
estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities
and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt.  This analysis does not consider the effects
of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas’ capital structure.

Statements

Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ended May 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors

Cintas Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cintas
Corporation as of May 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended May 31, 2004. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cintas
Corporation at May 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
May 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business description.

Cintas Corporation (Cintas) provides highly
specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America.  Cintas designs, manufactures, and implements
corporate identity uniform programs, provides entrance mats, restroom supplies,
promotional products, and first aid and safety products and services and
document management services for over 500,000 businesses.

Cintas classifies its
businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services.  The Rentals operating segment designs and
manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents, along with other
items, to its customers.  The Other
Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of
uniforms to its customers, as well as the sale of ancillary services including
restroom supplies, first aid products and services, document management and
cleanroom supplies.  All of these
services are provided throughout the United States and Canada to businesses of
all types - from small service manufacturing companies to major corporations
that employ thousands of people.

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Cintas and its subsidiaries. 
Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Financial results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cintas considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less, at date of purchase, to be
cash equivalents.

Marketable securities.

All marketable securities are comprised of
debt securities and classified as available-for-sale.  The majority of these debt securities are
obligations of state and political subdivisions.

Accounts receivable.

Accounts receivable are comprised of amounts
owed through product shipments and are presented net of an allowance for
uncollectible accounts.  This allowance
is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility.  An uncollectible accounts provision is
recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage and
increasing substantially as the account ages. 
The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the
Rentals and Other Services segments because of differences in customers served
and the nature of each business segment.

Inventories.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market.  Substantially all inventories
represent finished goods.

Uniforms and other rental items in service.

These items are valued at cost less
amortization, calculated using the straight-line method.  Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and
flame resistant garments) are amortized over their useful life of eighteen
months.  Other rental items including
shop towels, mats, cleanroom garments, flame resistant garments, linens and
restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to
forty-eight months.

Property and equipment.

Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method primarily over the following estimated useful lives, in
years:

Long-lived assets.

When events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated
future cash flows (undiscounted) are compared to the carrying amount of the
assets.  If the estimated future cash
flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is
recorded.  The impairment loss is
measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts.
Fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised


values, as appropriate.  Long-lived assets that are held for disposal
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less
estimated costs related to disposition.

Goodwill.

As of June 1, 2001, Cintas adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142),

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,

which addresses the financial
accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside
of a business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition.  This
accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately disclosed from other
intangible assets in the balance sheet, and no longer be amortized, but tested
for impairment on at least an annual basis. 
The provisions of this accounting standard also required the completion
of a transitional impairment test within six months of adoption, with any
impairments identified treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.

Cintas completed the
transitional goodwill impairment test for the year ended May 31, 2002, and the
annual goodwill impairment test for the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, as required by SFAS 142.  Based on
the results of the impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an
impairment of goodwill.  Cintas will
continue to perform future impairment tests as required by SFAS 142 as of
March 1 of each year.

Service contracts and other assets.

Service contracts and other assets, which
consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through
acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method
over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally five to ten
years.

Accrued liabilities.

Accrued liabilities consist primarily of
insurance, medical and profit sharing obligations and legal and environmental
contingencies.  These are recorded when
it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability
can be reasonably estimated.

Stock options.

Cintas applies the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.

Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been reflected in the financial statements as the
exercise price of options granted to employees is equal to the fair market
value of Cintas’ common stock on the date of grant.  Cintas has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

In December 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148),

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure.

This Statement amends SFAS 123 to provide
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  In addition, this Statement amends the
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. 
Cintas continues to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 for
the method used to account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements,
where applicable, but adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 during
fiscal 2003.


For purposes of pro forma
disclosure, the estimated fair value of Cintas’ stock options is amortized to
expense over the options’ vesting period. 
Pro forma results as if Cintas accounted for its stock-based employee
compensation using the fair value based alternative appear below:

The effects of providing pro
forma disclosure are not representative of earnings to be reported for future
years.

Derivatives and hedging activities.

Effective June 1, 2001, Cintas adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133),

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities,

as amended.  This standard requires the
recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and
recognition of the resulting gains or losses as adjustments to earnings or
other comprehensive income.  The adoption
of this new standard resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle of $44 recorded in other comprehensive loss to reflect the interest
rate swaps described in Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt.

Cintas formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions.  Cintas’ hedging activities
are transacted only with highly-rated institutions, reducing the exposure to
credit risk in the event of nonperformance.

Cintas uses derivatives for
both cash flow hedging and fair value hedging purposes.  For derivative instruments that hedge the
exposure of variability in short-term interest rates, designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of the net gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings.  For
the ineffective portion of the hedge, gains or losses are charged to earnings
in the current period.  For derivative
instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain
fixed rate debt, designated as fair value hedges, the effective portion of the
net gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain
or loss on the fixed rate debt attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in
current period earnings.

Cintas uses interest rate swap
and lock agreements as hedges against variability in short-term interest
rates.  These agreements effectively
convert a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing
the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.  Cintas uses the Hypothetical Derivative
Method for assessing the effectiveness of these swaps.  The effectiveness of these swaps is reviewed
at least every fiscal quarter.  Cintas
also uses reverse interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of fixed
rate debt to a floating rate basis, thus hedging for changes in the fair value
of the fixed rate debt being hedged. 
Cintas has determined that the interest rate swap agreements referenced
in Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt, designated as fair value hedges, qualify for
treatment under the short-cut method of measuring effectiveness.  Under the provisions of SFAS 133, these
hedges are determined to be perfectly effective and there is no requirement to
periodically evaluate effectiveness.

Revenue recognition.

Rental revenue is recognized when services
are performed and other services revenue is recognized when products are
shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer.  Cintas also establishes an estimate of
allowances for uncollectible accounts when revenue is recorded.


Fair value of financial instruments.

The following methods and assumptions were
used by Cintas in estimating the fair value of financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents

.  The amounts reported approximate market
value.

Marketable securities.

The amounts reported are at cost, which
approximates market value.  Market values
are based on quoted market prices.

Long-term debt.

The amounts reported are at a carrying value
which approximates market value.  Market
values are determined using similar debt instruments currently available to
Cintas that are consistent with the terms, interest rates and maturities.

Reclassification.

Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Other accounting pronouncements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

.  The Interpretation requires the consolidation
of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected
losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both,
as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
entity.  Currently, entities are
generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial
interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity.  Cintas adopted Financial Interpretation No.
46 on July 1, 2003, and it did not have a material effect on the financial
statements.

2.

MARKETABLE
SECURITIES

All marketable securities are
comprised of debt securities and classified as available-for-sale.  Realized gains and losses and declines in
value determined to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities
are included in interest income.  The
cost of the securities sold is based on the specific identification method.  Interest on securities classified as
available-for-sale is included in interest income.

The following is a summary of
marketable securities:

The gross realized gains on
sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $19, $105 and $585 for the years
ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, and the gross realized losses totaled $0,
$10 and $95, respectively.  Net unrealized
(losses)/gains are $(1,168) and $363 at May 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The cost and estimated fair
value of debt securities at May 31, 2004, by contractual maturity, are shown
below.  Expected maturities will differ
from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the
right to prepay the obligations without prepayment penalties.

GOODWILL,
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND OTHER ASSETS

Changes in the carrying amount
of goodwill for the years ended May 31, 2004 and 2003, by operating segment,
are as follows:

Information regarding Cintas’
service contracts and other assets follows:

Amortization expense was
$25,974, $27,741 and $18,810 for the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  Estimated amortization expense,
excluding any future acquisitions, for each of the next five years is $25,237,
$23,369, $21,753, $19,501 and $17,180, respectively.


5.

LONG-TERM
DEBT

Debt in the amount of $8,351 is
secured by assets with a carrying value of $10,006 at May 31, 2004.  Cintas has letters of credit outstanding at
May 31, 2004, approximating $53,052. 
Maturities of long-term debt during each of the next five years are
$10,523, $7,085, $4,057, $232,736 and $727, respectively.

Interest expense is net of
capitalized interest of $521, $186 and $594 for the years ended May 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.  Interest
paid, net of amount capitalized, was $25,825, $20,766 and $11,017 for the years
ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cintas has a commercial paper
program supported by a $300 million long-term credit facility.  As of May 31, 2004, there is no commercial
paper outstanding.

Cintas uses interest rate swap
and lock agreements as hedges against variability in short-term interest
rates.  These agreements effectively
convert a portion of floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing
the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.  There were no outstanding agreements of this
type at May 31, 2004.  Cintas has also
entered into two reverse interest rate swap agreements to protect the debt
against changes in the fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest
rate.  The reverse interest rate swap
agreements utilized by Cintas effectively modify Cintas’ exposure to interest
risk by converting Cintas’ fixed rate debt to a floating rate.  These agreements involve the receipt of fixed
rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of
the agreements without an exchange of underlying principal amount.  The mark-to-market values of both the fair
value hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are equal and
recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings.  The fair value hedges are 100%
effective.  The reverse interest rate
swap agreements total $225 million, expire in June 2007 and allow Cintas
to receive an effective interest rate of approximately 5.13% and pay an
interest rate based on LIBOR.

6.

LEASES

Cintas conducts certain
operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment.  Most leases contain renewal options for
periods from one to ten years.  The lease
agreements provide for increases in rentals if the options are exercised based
on increases in certain price level factors or other prearranged factors.  It is anticipated that expiring leases will
be renewed or replaced.  The minimum
rental payments under noncancelable lease arrangements for each of the next
five years and thereafter are $15,969, $12,903, $9,832, $7,767, $5,443 and
$7,128, respectively.  Rent expense under
operating leases during the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$22,743, $25,083 and $18,377, respectively.


7.

INCOME
TAXES

The components of deferred
income taxes included on the balance sheets are as follows:

Income taxes paid were
$118,125, $139,794 and $120,553 for the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

U.S. income taxes of $368, net
of foreign tax credits, have not been provided for on a cumulative total of
approximately $37,400 of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries as of May 31, 2004.  Cintas
intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the
United States.


8.

ACQUISITIONS

For all acquisitions accounted
for as purchases, including insignificant acquisitions (37 businesses for the
year ended May 31, 2004, and 30 businesses for the year ended May 31, 2003),
the purchase price paid for each has been allocated to the fair value of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
The following summarizes the aggregate purchase price for all businesses
acquired:

The results of operations for
the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of income
from the dates of acquisition.  The pro
forma revenue, net income and earnings per share information relating to
acquired businesses are not presented because they are not significant.

9.

DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION PLANS

Cintas’ Partners’ Plan is a
non-contributory profit sharing plan and ESOP for the benefit of substantially
all U.S. Cintas employees who have completed one year of service.  The plan also includes a 401(k) savings
feature covering substantially all employees. 
The amounts of contributions to the profit sharing plan and ESOP, as
well as the matching contribution to the 401(k), are made at the discretion of
Cintas.  Total contributions, including
Cintas’ matching contributions, were $22,160, $20,100 and $19,283 for the years
ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cintas also has a
non-contributory deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP), which covers
substantially all Canadian employees.  In
addition, a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is offered to those
employees.  The amounts of contributions
to the DPSP, as well as the matching contribution to the RRSP, are made at the
discretion of Cintas.  Total
contributions were $1,055, $860 and $786 for the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

10.

EARNINGS
PER SHARE

Earnings per share are computed
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share.

The basic computations are computed based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
period.  The diluted computations reflect
the potential dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised into
common stock, under certain circumstances, that then would share in the
earnings of Cintas.

The following table represents
a reconciliation of the shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per
share for the respective years:


11.

STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION

Under the stock option plan
adopted by Cintas in fiscal 2000, Cintas may grant officers and key employees
incentive stock options and/or non-qualified stock options to purchase an
aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of Cintas’ common stock.  Options are granted at the fair market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and generally vest and
become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year commencing five years after
grant, so long as the holder remains an employee of Cintas.

The information presented in
the following table relates primarily to stock options granted and outstanding
under either the plan adopted in fiscal 2000 or under similar plans:

The following table summarizes
the information related to stock options outstanding at May 31, 2004:

At May 31, 2004, 5,635,700
shares of common stock are reserved for future issuance under the 2000 plan.

Pro forma information regarding
earnings and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 and has been determined
as if Cintas had accounted for its stock options granted subsequent to May 31,
1995, under the fair value method of SFAS 123. 
The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002 was $18.43, $19.43 and $22.65, respectively.  The fair value of these options was estimated
at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions:


The Black-Scholes option-pricing
model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
which have no vesting restrictions and are freely transferable.  In addition, option valuation models require
the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility.  Because Cintas’ options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate, in Cintas’ opinion existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.

12.

LITIGATION
AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Cintas is subject to legal
proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including
personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims.  In the opinion of management, the aggregate
liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions,
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of
operations of Cintas.  Cintas is party to
additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business,
including the litigation discussed below.

Cintas is a defendant in a
purported class action lawsuit,

Paul Veliz, et al., v.
Cintas Corporation

, filed on March 19, 2003, in the United
States District Court, Northern District of California, Oakland Division,
alleging that Cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws
applicable to its service sales representatives, whom Cintas considers exempt
employees, and asserting additional related ERISA claims.  The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified
monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. 
Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’ allegations.
 The court ordered arbitration for all
potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of four narrowly
defined exceptions.  As a result, Cintas
believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be required to
arbitrate their claims.  No determination
has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class certification.  There can be no assurance as to whether a
class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or
other scope of such class.  If a court or
arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on
the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the
resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing
basis could be material to Cintas.  Any
estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.

Cintas is also a defendant in a
purported class action lawsuit,

Robert Ramirez, et al., v.
Cintas Corporation

, filed on January 20, 2004, and pending in
the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San
Francisco Division.  The case was brought
on behalf of all past and present female, African-American and Hispanic
employees of Cintas and its subsidiaries. 
The complaint alleges that Cintas has engaged in a pattern and practice
of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment, hiring,
promotions, transfers, job assignments and pay. 
The complaint seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive
damages and attorney’s fees, among other things.  Cintas denies these claims and is defending
the plaintiffs’ allegations.  No filings
or determination has been made as to class certification.  There can be no assurance as to whether a
class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or
other scope of such class.  If a court
certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits,
or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the resulting liability
and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material
to Cintas.  Any estimated liability
relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.

The litigation discussed above,
if decided adversely to or settled by Cintas, may result in liability material
to Cintas’ financial condition or results of operations.  Cintas may enter into discussions regarding
settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter into settlement
agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of Cintas’
shareholders.


13.

SEGMENT
INFORMATION

Cintas classifies its
businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services.  The Rentals operating segment designs and
manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents, along with other
items, to its customers.  The Other
Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of
uniforms to customers as well as the sale of ancillary products and services.  These ancillary products and services include
restroom supplies, first aid and safety products and services, document
management services and cleanroom supplies. 
All of these services are provided throughout the United States and
Canada to businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing
companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people.

Information as to the
operations of Cintas’ different business segments is set forth below based on
the distribution of products and services offered.  Cintas evaluates performances based on
several factors of which the primary financial measures are business segment
revenue and income before income taxes. 
The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those
described in Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies.

QUARTERLY
FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

The following is a summary of
the results of operations for each of the quarters within the years ended May

15.

SUPPLEMENTAL
GUARANTOR INFORMATION

Effective June 1, 2000,
Cintas reorganized its legal structure and created Cintas Corporation No. 2
(Corp. 2) as its indirectly, wholly-owned principal operating subsidiary.  Cintas and its wholly-owned, direct and
indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than Corp. 2, unconditionally guaranteed,
jointly and severally, debt of Corp. 2.

On May 13, 2002, Cintas
completed the acquisition of Omni Services, Inc. (Omni) for $656,071.  The purchase price for Omni was funded with
$450,000 in long-term notes, $100,000 of borrowings under a commercial paper
program and $106,071 in cash.  The
$450,000 in long-term notes consists of $225,000 with five-year maturities at
an interest rate of 5.125% and $225,000 with ten-year maturities at an interest
rate of 6%.  An additional working
capital payment of $3,055 was made during the second quarter of fiscal 2003,
bringing the total purchase price to $659,126. 
Corp. 2 was the issuer of the $450,000 long-term notes, which are
unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Cintas Corporation and
the subsidiary guarantors.

As allowed by SEC rules, the
following condensed consolidating financial statements are provided as an
alternative to filing separate financial statements of the guarantors.  Each of the subsidiaries presented in the

participation of Cintas’ management, including Cintas’ Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, President, General Counsel and Controllers, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of Cintas’ disclosure controls and
procedures as of May 31, 2004.  Based on
these evaluations, Cintas’ management, including the Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, President, General Counsel and Controllers, concluded
that Cintas’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31,
2004.  There have been no changes to
Cintas’ internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to affect, Cintas’ internal control over financial reporting.
