                                     ITEM 1.
                                    BUSINESS

The Company began business in 1929 as an Ohio  Corporation and changed its state
of  incorporation  to Washington in 1986.  Cintas provides a highly  specialized
service  to  businesses  of all types - from  small  service  and  manufacturing
companies to major  corporations  that employ  thousands of people.  The Company
designs,   manufactures  and  implements  corporate  identity  uniform  programs
throughout the United States.

The rental markets served by the Company are highly  fragmented and  competition
for this  business  varies at each of the Company's  locations.  There are other
companies  in  the  uniform  rental  business  which  have  financial  resources
comparable to those of the Company, although much of the competition consists of
smaller local and regional firms. In certain  instances,  local  competitors may
also have financial  resources  comparable to those deployed by the Company in a
particular  market.  The Company believes that the primary  competitive  factors
that affect its  operations  are  quality,  service,  design and price,  in that
order.

The service  provided to the rental  markets  served by the Company  principally
consists of the rental and  cleaning of uniforms as well as  providing  on-going
uniform upgrades to each customer.  The Company also offers  ancillary  products
which includes the rental or sale of walk-off mats, fender covers, towels, mops,
linen products and first aid products and services.

Due to its diverse  customer  base and  average  account  size,  the loss of one
account would not have a significant financial impact on the Company.

In its sale of customized  uniforms,  Cintas and its subsidiary Uniforms To You,
compete on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers, some
of which have financial resources comparable to the Company's.

The Company operates seven wholly owned  manufacturing  facilities which provide
for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs.  Additional products are
purchased from several outside  suppliers.  Because of the Company's  ability to
manufacture much of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not have
a significant effect on the Company. In regard to the availability of fabric for
the manufacturing  process, the Company purchases fabric from several suppliers.
The Company is not aware of any circumstances  which would hinder its ability to
obtain these materials.

The  Company  does  not  anticipate  any  material   capital   expenditures  for
environmental  controls  that  would  have a  material  effect on its  financial
condition.  The  Company  is not  aware  of  any  material  non-compliance  with
environmental laws.

At May 31,  1998,  the  Company  employed  16,957  employees  of which  770 were
represented by labor unions.  The Company  considers its  relationship  with its
employees to be satisfactory.

The table sets forth the revenues derived from each service provided by Cintas.

             The Company  occupies  193  facilities  located in 154 cities.  The

processing plants that house administrative, sales and service personnel and the
necessary  equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and bulk items. Branch
operations provide administrative,  sales and service functions. Cintas operates
four distribution  facilities and has seven  manufacturing  plants.  The Company

                                LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In December 1992, the Company was served with an "Imminent and  Substantial
Endangerment  and  Remedial  Action  Order"  (the  "Order")  by  the  California
Department of Toxic  Substances  Control  relating to the facility leased by the
Company in San Leandro,  California.  The Order requires  Cintas and three other
allegedly  responsible  parties  to  respond  to  alleged  soil and  groundwater
contamination at and around the San Leandro facility. It is not possible at this
time to estimate the loss or range of loss associated  with the claim.  Based on
information  that has been made  available  to the Company,  however,  it is not
believed  that the matter will have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
financial condition or results of its operations.

             The Company is also a party to incidental litigation brought in the
ordinary course of business,  none of which individually or in the aggregate, is
considered  to be material to its  operations  or  financial  condition.  Cintas
maintains  insurance  coverage against certain  liabilities that it may incur in
its operations from time to time.
