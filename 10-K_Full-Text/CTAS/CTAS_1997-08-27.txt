                                     PART I
                                     ITEM 1.
                                    BUSINESS

     The Company began business in 1929 as an Ohio  Corporation  and changed its
state  of  incorporation  to  Washington  in  1986.  Cintas  provides  a  highly
specialized service to businesses of all types - from small service companies to
major  corporations  that  employ  thousands  of people.  The  Company  designs,
manufactures and implements  corporate identity uniform programs  throughout the
United States.

     The  rental  markets  served  by the  Company  are  highly  fragmented  and
competition for this business varies at each of the Company's  locations.  There
are  other  companies  in the  uniform  rental  business  which  have  financial
resources  comparable to those of the Company,  although much of the competition
consists  of smaller  local and  regional  firms.  In certain  instances,  local
competitors  may also have financial  resources  comparable to those deployed by
the  Company in a  particular  market.  The  Company  believes  that the primary
competitive factors that affect its operations are quality,  service, design and
price, in that order.

     The  service   provided  to  the  rental  markets  served  by  the  Company
principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing
on-going  uniform  upgrades to each customer.  The Company also offers ancillary
products  which  includes the rental or sale of walk-off  mats,  fender  covers,
towels, mops, linen products and first aid products and services.

     Due to its diverse  customer base and average account size, the loss of one
account would not have a significant financial impact on the Company.

     In its sale of customized  uniforms,  Cintas  competes on a national  basis
with other uniform  suppliers and  manufacturers,  some of which have  financial
resources comparable to the Company's.

     The Company  operates  four  manufacturing  facilities  which provide for a
substantial  amount of its  standard  uniform  needs.  Additional  products  are
purchased from several outside  suppliers.  Because of the Company's  ability to
manufacture much of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not have
a significant effect on the Company. In regard to the availability of fabric for
the manufacturing  process, the Company purchases fabric from several suppliers.
The Company is not aware of any circumstances  which would hinder its ability to
obtain these materials.

     The Company does not  anticipate  any  material  capital  expenditures  for
environmental  controls  that  would  have a  material  effect on its  financial
condition.  The  Company  is not  aware  of  any  material  non-compliance  with
environmental laws.

     At May 31, 1997,  the Company  employed  11,996  employees of which 87 were
represented by labor unions.  The Company  considers its  relationship  with its
employees to be satisfactory.

     The table sets forth the revenues  derived  from each  service  provided by
Cintas.

                                LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In December 1992, the Company was served with an "Imminent and  Substantial
Endangerment  and  Remedial  Action  Order"  (the  "Order")  by  the  California
Department of Toxic  Substances  Control  relating to the facility leased by the
Company in San Leandro,  California.  The Order requires  Cintas and three other
allegedly  responsible  parties  to  respond  to  alleged  soil and  groundwater
contamination at and around the San Leandro facility. It is not possible at this
time to estimate the loss or range of loss associated  with the claim.  Based on
information  that has been made  available  to the Company,  however,  it is not
believed  that the matter will have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
financial condition or results of its operations.

     The  Company  is also a  party  to  incidental  litigation  brought  in the
ordinary course of business,  none of which individually or in the aggregate, is
considered  to be material to its  operations  or  financial  condition.  Cintas
maintains  insurance  coverage against certain  liabilities that it may incur in
its operations from time to time.

               SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
