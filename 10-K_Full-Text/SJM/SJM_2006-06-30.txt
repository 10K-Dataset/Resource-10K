PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Company

. The J. M. Smucker Company (the “Company”) was established in 1897
and was incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a registered
trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food
products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of the Company’s sales are in the United
States. The Company’s operations outside the United States are principally in Canada although
products are exported to other countries as well. Sales outside the United States represent
approximately 19 percent of total consolidated Company sales for fiscal 2006.

The Company has two reportable segments: U.S. retail market and special markets. The
Company’s U.S. retail market segment includes the consumer and consumer oils and baking businesses
and represents a strategic focus area for the Company – the sale of branded food products with
leadership positions to consumers through mainstream domestic retail outlets in North America. The
special markets segment represents the aggregation of the foodservice, beverage, Canada, and
international businesses.

Principal Products

. The principal products of the Company, which are sold in both the
Company’s U.S. retail market segment and special markets segment, are peanut butter, shortening and
oils, flour and baking ingredients, fruit spreads, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings,
fruit and vegetable juices, beverages, dessert toppings, syrups, frozen sandwiches, pickles and
condiments, and potato side dishes.

Product sales information for the years 2006, 2005, and 2004 is incorporated herein by
reference to information set forth in the Company’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 36
through 38 under “Note E: Reportable Segments.”

In the U.S. retail market segment, the Company’s products are primarily sold through brokers
to food retailers, food wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount stores, and military
commissaries. In the special markets segment, the Company’s products are distributed domestically
and in foreign countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (i.e.,
restaurants, schools and universities, healthcare operators), other food manufacturers, health and
natural foods stores and distributors.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

. The raw materials used by the Company in
each of its segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Glass, plastic,
caps, carton board, and corrugate are the principal packaging materials used by the Company. The
fruit, pickle, and condiment raw materials used by the Company in the production of its food
products are purchased from independent growers and suppliers. Sweeteners, peanuts, oils, wheat
and flour, and other ingredients are obtained from various other sources. The cost and
availability of some of these commodities has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time.
The Company also uses commodity futures and options to hedge some of its costs. Raw materials are
available from numerous sources, and the Company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain
adequate supplies. The Company has not historically encountered shortages of key raw materials.
The Company considers its relationship with key raw material suppliers to be good.

Trademarks and Patents

. The Company’s products are produced under certain patents and
marketed under numerous trademarks owned by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Major
trademarks, utilized primarily in the U.S. retail market segment, include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco,
Mary Ellen, Dutch Girl, Martha White, Hungry Jack, Uncrustables, Simply Jif, Golden Temple,
Softasilk, Dickinson’s, Crosse & Blackwell, Adams, Laura Scudder’s, Goober, Pet, Magic Shell,

and

Simple Measures.

Major trademarks primarily utilized in the special markets segment include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco, Bick’s, Robin Hood, R. W. Knudsen Family, Golden Temple, Santa Cruz
Organic, Double Fruit, Simply Nutritious, Recharge,

and

Red River

. Pillsbury, the Pillsbury
Barrelhead logo, and Pillsbury



Doughboy are trademarks of The Pillsbury Company, used by the Company under a 20-year, perpetually
renewable, royalty-free license. In addition, the Company or one of its subsidiaries licenses the
use of several other trademarks, none of which individually is material to the Company’s business.

Slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include (without limitation) the
slogan,

“With A Name Like Smucker’s, It Has To Be Good,” “Choosy Moms Choose Jif,” “Choosy Dads
Choose Jif,” “Great Meals Start Here,” “Start Something Good with Crisco,” “We’ve Got Ice Cream
Covered,” “The Spread that Makes Bread Smile,” “For the Hungry Jack in Your House,” “Goodness
Gracious, It’s Good,” “A Southern Family Tradition,”

the

Smucker’s

banner, the Crock Jar shape, the
Gingham design, and the Strawberry logo.

The Company considers all of these trademarks and the Pillsbury license to be essential to its
business.

Seasonality

. The Company’s consumer oils and baking business is moderately seasonal
around the “fall bake” period, which generally impacts sales and profits in the Company’s second
and third quarters. The overall impact of seasonal trends, however, is not considered significant.

Working Capital

. Working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of
the Company’s fiscal year mainly due to the timing of fruit and pickle procurement and the buildup
of inventories necessary to support the “fall bake” season.

Customers

. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries amounted to
approximately 18 percent, 16 percent, and 16 percent of net sales in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segment. No other
customer exceeded ten percent of net sales during 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Orders

.
Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of
unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.

Government Business

. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to
negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition

. The Company is the branded market leader in the peanut butter,
shortening and oils, fruit spreads, dessert toppings, and health and natural foods beverages
categories. The Company’s business is highly competitive as all of its brands compete for retail
shelf space with other advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label
products.

The

Jif

brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for over 20 years, while the
Company’s natural peanut butter business, sold under the

Smucker’s

,

Adam’s

, and

Laura Scudder’s

brands, maintains a strong leadership position in the natural peanut butter category.

Crisco

has
been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories for over 50 years.

Crisco

holds the
number one position among branded competitors in both the oils and shortening categories. The oils
category in which

Crisco

competes is a more competitive category than the others in which the
Company’s brands compete due to a larger private label presence and more volatile commodity
pricing. The Company’s fruit spread brands, including

Smucker’s

and

Dickinson’s

, compete with
three major branded lines of fruit spreads and many private label brands. The competing brands
exist on both a national and a regional level.

The Company competes in the dessert and baking mixes (“DBM”) market that includes mixes for
cakes, cookies, brownies, muffins, and quickbreads, as well as ready-to-spread frostings and
ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour. Within the DBM category, the Company competes
primarily with Betty Crocker, which is marketed by General Mills, Inc., and Duncan Hines, which is
marketed by Pinnacle Food Group, Inc. The Company’s

Hungry Jack

brand competes in three primary
market categories: pancake mix, potato side dishes, and table syrup. The Company competes
primarily with Aunt Jemima, which is marketed by PepsiCo’s Quaker Foods North America segment, in
pancake mix



and table syrups, Mrs. Butterworth’s and Log Cabin which is marketed by Pinnacle Food Group, Inc.,
in table syrups, and Betty Crocker in potato side dishes.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, product and packaging innovations,
technological advances, and new industry techniques have all added additional variables for
companies in the food industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The principal methods
of and factors in competition are product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions,
nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and promotion. Positive factors
pertaining to the Company’s competitive position include well-recognized brands, experienced brand
management, varied product offerings, product innovation, and a strong distribution network.

Research and Development

. The Company predominantly utilizes in-house resources to
both develop new products and improve existing products in each of its business areas. Amounts
expensed for product development were $10,781,000, $10,397,000, and $7,496,000 in 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively.

Environmental Matters

. Compliance with the provisions of federal, state, and local
environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the
protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon the Company’s capital
expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

However, on May 5, 2005, representatives from the California Environmental Protection Agency
Department of Toxic Substances Control (“CEPA”) informed Smucker Quality Beverages, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“SQB”), that CEPA is conducting an investigation to
identify a source area for chlorinated volatile organic compounds that have been found in domestic
water supply wells at residential properties near SQB’s property at Speedway Ave, Chico,
California. It is possible that CEPA will identify the SQB Chico property as a contributing
source of the contamination because of the operations of prior owners of the property. In such
event, SQB may be responsible for investigation and remediation expenses, the full amount of which
cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. The water used at the Chico facility and in the
manufacturing process is purified and does not contain chlorinated volatile organic compounds.

Subsequent to the Company’s initial notification of the investigation by CEPA, the Company has
learned that the former owner’s use of the property in manufacturing activities may have
contributed to the contamination. Although the former owner is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy status,
language contained in its reorganization plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court on April 21, 2006,
contains both assumption and indemnity provisions from its parent company that cover both present
and future environmental liability, both known and unknown. The Company continues to monitor this
situation. The Company continues to conclude that based upon available information, commencement
of litigation or assertion of a claim or assessment by CEPA is not currently probable. It is a
reasonable possibility that as the current owner of the property, the Company may be named a
potentially responsible party along with the former owner of the property. However, as explained
above, the Company does not currently believe it will incur a liability related to this matter and
has determined that an accrual is not necessary at this time.

Employees

. At April 30, 2006, the Company had approximately 3,500 full-time
employees, worldwide. Approximately 38 percent of these employees, located at 11 facilities, are
covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. The Company
believes its relations with its current employees are generally good.

Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographical Areas

. The financial
information required to be included in this Item concerning reportable industry segments and
international operations for the years 2006, 2005, and 2004 is incorporated herein by reference to
information set forth in the Company’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 36 through 38,
under “Note E: Reportable Segments.” The Company’s international operations are primarily in
Canada with risks similar to those associated with the U.S. retail market segment. The Company’s
Canada sales primarily represents the sale of Canadian produced products to Canadian customers.



Forward-Looking Statements

. This report includes forward-looking statements that are
based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from expected or projected results. The descriptions of
risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements is incorporated herein by reference
to information set forth in the Company’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption
“Forward-Looking Statements” on page 19.

Available Information

. Access to all Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
filings made by the Company, including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, is provided, free of charge, on the Company’s Web site
(

www.smuckers.com/fc/investor/

) as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are
electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The Company’s business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks
and uncertainties. The risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with
the other information contained or incorporated by reference in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and
in the Company’s other filings with the SEC, in connection with evaluating the Company, its
business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial
also may affect the Company. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a
material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

•

The Company operates in the competitive food industry and relies on continued demand for
the Company’s products.

The Company faces competition across its product lines from other food companies with the
primary methods and factors in competition being product quality, price, packaging, new
product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and
promotion. In order to generate future revenues and profits, the Company must continue to
sell products that appeal to the Company’s customers and consumers. Specifically, there are
a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact the Company and the food industry
as a whole including convenience, consumer dietary trends, and obesity, health and
nutritional concerns. Continued success is dependent on product innovation, the ability to
secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space, and effective trade merchandising,
advertising, and marketing programs. Some of the Company’s competitors have substantial
financial, marketing, and other resources, and competition with them in the Company’s various
markets and product lines could cause the Company to reduce prices, increase marketing or
other expenditures, or lose category share. Category share and growth could be adversely
impacted if the Company is not successful in introducing new products.

•

The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry.

The food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product
tampering, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. The Company’s operations
could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding the Company’s products. In
the event of product contamination or tampering, the Company may need to recall some of its
products. A widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of
conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales
resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time. The Company could also
suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it. Either a significant
product recall, or a product liability judgment could also result in a loss of consumer
confidence in the Company’s food products and an actual or perceived loss of value of the
Company’s brands, materially impacting consumer demand.





Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.



Item 2. Properties.

The table below lists all of the Company’s manufacturing and processing facilities at
April 30, 2006. All of the Company’s properties are maintained and updated on a regular basis, and
the Company continues to make investments for expansion and technological improvements. The
Company believes that existing capacity at these facilities is sufficient to sustain current
operations and anticipated growth.

The properties listed below are owned, except for the following properties, which are leased:
the West Fargo, North Dakota, facility; the land at the Pt. Colborne, Ontario, facility; and the
land at the Montreal, Quebec, bakery mix facility. Other than customary lease terms and rental
payment obligations, there are no material performance obligations associated with the properties
listed below. The Company’s corporate headquarters are located
in Orrville, Ohio, and the Company’s
Canadian headquarters are located in Markham, Ontario. The West Fargo location is currently
expected to close during fiscal 2007, as part of the Company’s restructuring plans as described in
the Company’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders on pages 35 and 36 under “Note D: Restructuring.”

wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“SQB”), that CEPA is conducting an investigation to
