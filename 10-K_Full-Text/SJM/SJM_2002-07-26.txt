PART I

Item 1. Business

The Company.

The J. M. Smucker Company was established in 1897 and was
incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a
registered trademark), operates in one industry, the manufacturing and
marketing of food products on a worldwide basis although the majority of the
Company’s sales are in the United States. The Company’s distribution outside
the United States is principally in Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, China
and the Pacific Rim, Europe, and the Middle East although products are exported
to other countries as well. International sales represent less than 15% of
total consolidated Company sales for fiscal 2002. Unless otherwise indicated
by the context, the term “Company” as used in this report means the continuing
operations of The J. M. Smucker Company and its subsidiaries within the
domestic segment.

On June 1, 2002, the Company merged the

Jif

peanut butter and

Crisco

shortening and oils businesses of The Procter & Gamble Company with and into
the Company. Information regarding the merger is hereby incorporated by
reference from the 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 27 and 28 under
“Note C: Subsequent Event.” As a result of the

Jif

and

Crisco

merger, the
Company’s reportable segments will be restated to U.S. Retail Markets and
Special Markets in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

Principal Products.

The principal products of the Company are fruit
spreads, dessert toppings, peanut butters, frozen peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches, industrial fruit products, fruit and vegetable juices, beverages,
syrups, condiments, and gift packages.

Product sale information for the years 2002, 2001, and 2000 is hereby
incorporated by reference from the 2002 Annual Report to
Shareholders, on pages
28 through 30 under “Note D: Operating Segments.”

In its domestic segment, the Company’s products are primarily sold through
brokers to chain, wholesale, cooperative, independent grocery accounts and
other consumer markets, to foodservice distributors and chains including
hotels, restaurants, schools and other institutions, and to other food
manufacturers.

With the addition of the

Jif

and

Crisco

businesses in fiscal 2003, fruit
spreads, peanut butter and shortening and oils are together expected to make up
approximately 75% of the Company’s business.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials.

The fruit raw materials used
by the Company in the production of its food products are purchased from
independent growers and suppliers. Because of the seasonal nature and
volatility of quantities of most of the crops on which the Company depends, it
is necessary to prepare and freeze stocks of fruit, fruit juices, berries, and
other food products and to maintain them in cold storage warehouses.
Sweeteners, peanuts, and other ingredients are obtained from various other
sources.

Trademarks and Patents.

The Company’s products are produced under certain
patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned by the Company. Major
trademarks include:

Smucker’s, Dickinson’s, Lost Acres, Mary Ellen, Adams,
Laura Scudder’s, Goober, Simply Fruit, Magic Shell, Sundae Syrup, Smucker’s
Snackers, Uncrustables, R. W. Knudsen Family, After The Fall, Simply
Nutritious, Recharge, Santa Cruz Organic,

and

Spritzer

. In addition, the
Company licenses the use of several other trademarks, none of which
individually is material to the Company’s business.

As a result of the merger of the

Jif

and

Crisco

businesses, the Company
added the following



trademarks:

Jif

,

Simply Jif

,

Jif Smooth Sensations

, and

Crisco

. In addition,

Jif

and

Crisco

have a portfolio of U.S. and foreign
patents, and pending applications related to processes and products with
varying durations.

Other slogans or designs considered to be important Company trademarks
include (without limitation) the slogan, “With a name like Smucker’s

,

it has to
be good,” “Over 100 Years of Family-Made Goodness,” the

Smucker’s

banner, the
Crock Jar shape, the Gingham design, and the Strawberry logo.

The Company considers all of these trademarks to be essential to the
Company’s business.

Seasonality.

Historically, the Company’s business has not been highly
seasonal.

Working Capital.

Working capital requirements for the Company and much of
the fruit spread industry are greatest during the late spring and summer months
due to seasonal procurement of fruits and berries.

Customers.

The Company is not dependent on a single customer or a few
customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of
consolidated sales.

With the completion of the

Jif

and

Crisco

merger, it is anticipated that
in fiscal 2003 the Company will have one customer, Wal-Mart and its affiliates,
with net sales exceeding 10%.

Orders.

Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the
backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time is not and, has not been,
material.

Government Business.

No material portion of the Company’s business is
subject to negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election
of the government.

Competition.

The Company is the market leader in the fruit spreads,
dessert topping, health and natural foods beverages, natural peanut butter, and
peanut butter combination categories. The Company’s business is highly
competitive as all its brands compete for retail shelf space with other
advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label
products. The Company’s brands compete with four major branded lines of fruit
spreads and many private label brands. The competing brands exist on both a
national and regional level. The continued growth of alternative store formats
(i.e., club stores and mass merchandise stores), consolidation of retailers,
manufacturers, and brokers within the food industry, and changes in business
practices, resulting from both technological advances and new industry
techniques, have all added additional variables for companies in the food
industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The principal methods of
and factors in competition are product quality, price, advertising, and
promotion. Positive factors pertaining to the Company’s competitive position
include well-recognized brands, strong brand management, varied product
offerings, and a strong distribution network.

The

Jif

brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for over 20
years. The

Jif

brand is marked by its distinct product differentiation (“more
fresh roasted peanut taste”) and a consistent advertising campaign (“Choosy
Moms Choose Jif”).

Crisco

has been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils
category for over 50 years.

Jif

and

Crisco

products are sold primarily in the
United States to food retailers, food wholesales, club stores, and mass
merchandisers.

Jif

and

Crisco

products are distributed to the Canadian market
as well.

Crisco’s

oils business holds the number one volume share position
among branded competitors in the grocery and drug channels, and the number one
overall share with mass merchandisers. The positive factors pertaining to the

Jif

and

Crisco

businesses are the same as



those mentioned in the preceding paragraph with respect to the Company’s traditional businesses. The oils
category in which

Crisco

competes is a more competitive category than the
others in which the Company’s brands compete due to a larger private label
presence and more volatile commodity pricing.

Research and Development.

The Company predominantly utilizes in-house
resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of
its business areas. In relation to consolidated assets and operating expenses,
amounts expensed for research and development in each of the areas and in the
aggregate were not material in any of the last three years.

Environmental Matters.

Compliance with the provisions of federal, state,
and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials
into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to
have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive
position of the Company.

Employees.

At April 30, 2002, the Company had approximately 2,300
full-time employees, worldwide. Approximately 760 of these employees, located
at six facilities, are covered by union contracts between the Company and the
Teamsters. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. Although
the Company believes its relations with its current employees are generally
good, the Company is currently experiencing a strike of its employees at its
Woodburn, Oregon fruit processing facility. During peak season, the Woodburn
facility has employed as many as 200 employees. The facility is operating at
normal capacity utilizing seasonal and supervisory staff.

Upon completion of the

Jif

and

Crisco

merger on June 1, 2002, the Company
added approximately 400 full-time employees.

Segment and Geographic Information.

Information concerning operating
segments including international operations for the years 2002, 2001, and 2000
is hereby incorporated by reference from the 2002 Annual Report to
Shareholders, on pages 28 through 30 under “Note D: Operating Segments.”

Certain Forward-Looking Statements.

This report includes certain
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are hereby incorporated by
reference from the Company’s 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders under “Certain
Forward-Looking Statements” on page 17.

The table below lists all the Company’s manufacturing and fruit processing

growth.
