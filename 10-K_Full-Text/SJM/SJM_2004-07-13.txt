PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Company. The J. M. Smucker Company was established in 1897 and was
incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a
registered trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing
and marketing of branded food products on a worldwide basis although the
majority of the Company’s sales are in the United States. The Company’s
operations outside the United States are principally in Canada although
products are exported to other countries as well. International sales
represent less than ten percent of total consolidated Company sales for fiscal
2004.

The U.S. retail market includes the consumer and consumer oils businesses
and represents the primary strategic focus area for the Company — the sale of
branded food products with leadership positions to consumers through mainstream
domestic retail outlets in North America. The special markets segment
represents the aggregation of the foodservice, international, industrial, and
beverage businesses.

On June 16, 2004, the Company sold its Australian subsidiary, Henry Jones
Foods, Pty. Ltd. Information regarding the sale is hereby incorporated by
reference to the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, on page 46 under “Note R:
Subsequent Event.”

On June 18, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of International
Multifoods Corporation (Multifoods). Information regarding the acquisition is
hereby incorporated by reference to the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, on
pages 29 and 30 under “Note B: Subsequent Event — Multifoods Acquisition
(Unaudited).”

Principal Products. The principal products of the Company, which are sold
in both the Company’s U.S. retail market segment and special markets segment,
are peanut butter, shortening and oils, fruit spreads, fruit and vegetable
juices, beverages, dessert toppings, syrups, and frozen sandwiches. With the
completion of the Multifoods acquisition, the principal products of the Company
will also include flour and scratch baking ingredients, dessert and baking
mixes, ready-to-spread frostings, potato mixes, dry breakfast mixes, syrups,
and pickles and condiments.

Product sale information for the years 2004, 2003, and 2002 is hereby
incorporated by reference to the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages
32 and 33, under “Note F: Reportable Segments.”

In the U.S. retail market, the Company’s products are primarily sold
through brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, club stores, mass
merchandisers, and military commissaries. In the special markets, the
Company’s products are distributed through foreign countries, foodservice
distributors and operators (i.e., restaurants, schools and universities,
healthcare operators), other food manufacturers, and health and natural food
stores.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials. The raw materials used by the Company are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. The fruit raw materials used
by the Company in the production of its food products are purchased from
independent growers and suppliers. Sweeteners, peanuts, oils, wheat and flour,
and other ingredients are obtained from various other sources. Although
availability and costs may vary from year to year, raw materials are available
from numerous sources and the Company believes that it will continue to be able
to obtain adequate supplies.

Trademarks and Patents. The Company’s products are produced under certain
patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned by the Company or one of
its subsidiaries. Major trademarks, primarily utilized in the U.S. retail
market, include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco, Simply Jif, Dickinson’s, Adams, Laura
Scudder’s, Goober, Simply 100% Fruit, Magic Shell, Sundae Syrup,

and

Uncrustables.

Major trademarks primarily utilized in the special markets
include:

Smucker’s, R. W.



Knudsen Family, Simply Nutritious, Recharge, Santa Cruz Organic, Spritzer,

and

Double Fruit

. In addition, the Company or one of its subsidiaries licenses the
use of several other trademarks, none of which individually is material to the
Company’s business.

Other slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include
(without limitation) the slogan, “With a name like Smucker’s

,

it has to be
good,” “Over 100 Years of Family-Made Goodness,” “Choosy Moms Choose

Jif

,”
“Great Meals Start Here,” “Start Something Good with

Crisco

,” the

Smucker’s

banner, the Crock Jar shape, the Gingham design, and the Strawberry logo.

With the completion of the Multifoods acquisition, the Company will also
utilize the following trademarks in the U.S. retail market:

Pillsbury, Martha
White, Jim Dandy, Gladiola, Robin Hood, La Pina, Red Band, Softasilk, Hungry
Jack, Idaho Spuds, Pet,

and

Farmhouse

. The Pillsbury Barrelhead and Pillsbury
Doughboy are registered trademarks of The Pillsbury Company, used under a
20-year, perpetually renewable, royalty-free license. In addition, the
following trademarks will also be utilized in the special markets:

Bick’s,
Golden Temple, Robin Hood, Old Mill, Red River,

and

Purity

.

The Company considers all of these trademarks and the Pillsbury license to
be essential to its business.

Seasonality. The Company’s

Crisco

business is moderately seasonal around the
“fall bake” period and as a result impacts sales and profits in the Company’s
second and third quarters. The overall impact however, is not considered
significant. The completion of the Multifoods acquisition is expected to increase
the seasonality around the “fall bake” period.

Working
Capital. Working capital requirements are greatest during the first
half of the Company's fiscal year due to the timing of fruit
procurement and the build up of inventories necessary to support the
“fall bake” season.

Customers. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries amounted
to approximately 13 and 14 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2004 and
2003, respectively. These sales are included primarily in the U.S. retail
market. No other customer exceeded ten percent of consolidated net sales for
any year.

Orders. Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the
backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a
historical basis.

Government Business. No material portion of the Company’s business is
subject to negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election
of the government.

Competition. The Company is the branded market leader in the peanut
butter, shortening and oils, fruit spreads, dessert toppings, and health and
natural foods beverages categories. The Company’s business is highly
competitive as all of its brands compete for retail shelf space with other
advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label
products.

The

Jif

brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for over 20
years.

Crisco

has been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils category
for over 50 years.

Crisco

holds the number one position among branded
competitors in both the oils and shortening categories. The oils category in
which

Crisco

competes is a more competitive category than the others in which
the Company’s brands compete due to a larger private label presence and more
volatile commodity pricing. The Company’s fruit spread brands, including

Smucker’s

and

Dickinson’s

, compete with three major branded lines of fruit
spreads and many private label brands. The competing brands exist on both a
national and regional level.



Following completion of the Multifoods acquisition, the Company competes
in the dessert and baking mixes (DBM) market. The DBM market includes mixes
for cakes, cookies, brownies, muffins, and quickbreads, as well as
ready-to-spread frostings and ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour.
Within the DBM category, the Company competes primarily with

Betty Crocker

,
which is produced by General Mills, and

Duncan Hines

, which is produced by
Pinnacle Food Group, Inc. The Company’s

Hungry Jack

brand competes in three
primary market categories: pancake mix, dehydrated potatoes, and table syrup.
The Company competes primarily with

Aunt Jemima

, which is produced by PepsiCo’s
Quaker Foods North America segment, in pancake mix and

Betty Crocker

in
dehydrated potatoes.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, consolidation of
retailers, manufacturers, and brokers within the food industry, and changes in
business practices, resulting from both technological advances and new industry
techniques, have all added additional variables for companies in the food
industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The principal methods of
and factors in competition are product quality, price, packaging, customer
service, advertising, and promotion. Positive factors pertaining to the
Company’s competitive position include well-recognized brands, strong brand
management, varied product offerings, and a strong distribution network.

Research and Development. The Company predominantly utilizes in-house
resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of
its business areas. In relation to consolidated assets and operating expenses,
amounts expensed for research and development in each of the areas and in the
aggregate were not material in any of the last three years.

Environmental Matters. Compliance with the provisions of federal, state,
and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials
into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to
have a material effect upon the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings, or
competitive position.

Employees. At April 30, 2004, the Company had approximately 2,950
full-time employees, worldwide. Approximately 570 of these employees, located
at four facilities, are covered by union contracts between the Company and the
Teamsters. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. The
Company believes its relations with its current employees are generally good.
Following completion of the Multifoods merger, the Company has approximately
4,820 full-time employees.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

The Company is a defendant in 18 class action lawsuits in ten states
related to its

Simply 100% Fruit

product. The Company also has two class
action lawsuits in two states related to its

Dickinson 100% Fruit

product. The
complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer
fraud acts, unjust enrichment and breach of an express warranty based on the
allegation that

Simply 100% Fruit

does not contain 100 percent fruit and it
does not contain 100 percent of the fruit designated as the flavor (e.g.,
strawberry). The complaints generally seek damages in the form of either a
refund of the purchase price or the difference between the price of

Simply 100%
Fruit

and lower priced

Smucker

products. The Company believes these suits are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend these actions.

Item 4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

None.
