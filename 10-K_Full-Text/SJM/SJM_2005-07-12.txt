PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Company

. The J. M. Smucker Company (“the Company”) was established in 1897
and was incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a registered
trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food
products on a worldwide basis although the majority of the Company’s sales are in the United
States. The Company’s operations outside the United States are principally in Canada although
products are exported to other countries as well. Sales outside the United States represent
approximately 18 percent of total consolidated Company sales for fiscal 2005.

The Company’s U.S. retail market segment includes the consumer and consumer oils and baking
businesses and represents a strategic focus area for the Company – the sale of branded food
products with leadership positions to consumers through mainstream domestic retail outlets in North
America. The special markets segment represents the aggregation of the foodservice, beverage,
Canada, international, and industrial businesses.

On June 18, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of International Multifoods
Corporation (“Multifoods”). Information regarding the acquisition is hereby incorporated by
reference to the 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 32 through 34 under “Note B:
Multifoods Acquisition.”

On June 16, 2004, the Company sold its Australian subsidiary, Henry Jones Foods, Pty. Ltd. to
SPC Ardmona Ltd. On October 6, 2004, the Company sold its Brazilian subsidiary, Smucker do Brasil,
Ltda., to Cargill, Incorporated. On February 18, 2005, the Company sold the Multifoods U.S.
Foodservice and bakery products businesses, as well as the Canadian foodservice locations operated
under the Gourmet Baker name, which were acquired as part of Multifoods, to Value Creation
Partners, Inc. Information regarding these divestitures is hereby incorporated by reference to the
2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 34 and 35 under “Note C: Discontinued Operations.”

Principal Products

. The principal products of the Company, which are sold in both the
Company’s U.S. retail market segment and special markets segment, are peanut butter, shortening and
oils, fruit spreads, flour and baking ingredients, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings,
potato mixes, fruit and vegetable juices, beverages, dessert toppings, syrups, pickles and
condiments, and frozen sandwiches.

Product sales information for the years 2005, 2004, and 2003 is hereby incorporated by
reference to the 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 37 through 39 under “Note F:
Reportable Segments.”

In the U.S. retail market segment, the Company’s products are primarily sold through brokers
to food retailers, food wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, and military commissaries.
In the special markets segment, the Company’s products are distributed through retail channels,
foodservice distributors and operators (i.e., hotels and restaurants, schools and universities,
healthcare operators), other food manufacturers, health and natural food stores, and in foreign
countries.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

. The raw materials used by the Company are
primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. The fruit, pickle, and condiment raw
materials used by the Company in the production of its food products are purchased from independent
growers and suppliers. Sweeteners, peanuts, oils, wheat and flour, and other ingredients are
obtained from various other sources. Although availability and costs may vary from year to year,
raw materials are available from numerous sources and the Company believes that it will continue to
be able to obtain adequate supplies.

Trademarks and Patents

. The Company’s products are produced under certain patents and
marketed under numerous trademarks owned by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Major
trademarks, utilized primarily in the U.S. retail market, include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco,
Pillsbury, Martha



White, Hungry Jack, Uncrustables, Simply Jif, Golden Temple, Softasilk, Dickinson’s, Adams, Laura
Scudder’s, Goober, Idaho Spuds, Pet, Magic Shell,

and

Simple Measures.

Major trademarks primarily
utilized in the special markets include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco, Bick’s, Robin Hood, R. W. Knudsen
Family, Golden Temple, Santa Cruz Organic, Spritzer, Double Fruit, Simply Nutritious, Recharge,

and

Red River

. In addition, the Company or one of its subsidiaries licenses the use of several other
trademarks, none of which individually is material to the Company’s business.

Other slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include (without limitation)
the slogan,

“With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good,” “Choosy Moms Choose Jif,” “Choosy Dads
Choose Jif,” “Great Meals Start Here,” “Start Something Good with Crisco,” “We’ve Got Ice Cream
Covered,” “The Spread that Makes Bread Smile,” “For the Hungry Jack in Your House,” “Goodness
Gracious, It’s Good,”

the

Smucker’s

banner, the Crock Jar shape, the Gingham design, and the
Strawberry logo. The Pillsbury Barrelhead and Pillsbury Doughboy are registered trademarks of The
Pillsbury Company, used under a 20-year, perpetually renewable, royalty-free license.

The Company considers all of these trademarks and the Pillsbury license to be essential to its
business.

Seasonality

. The Company’s consumer oils and baking business is moderately seasonal
around the “fall bake” period and as a result impacts sales and profits in the Company’s second and
third quarters. The overall impact, however, is not considered significant.

Working Capital

. Working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of
the Company’s fiscal year due to the timing of fruit and pickle procurement and the buildup of
inventories necessary to support the “fall bake” season.

Customers

. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and subsidiaries amounted to approximately
16 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent of net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These
sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market. No other customer exceeded ten percent of
net sales for any year.

Orders

. Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of
unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.

Government Business

. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to
negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition

. The Company is the branded market leader in the peanut butter,
shortening and oils, fruit spreads, dessert toppings, and health and natural foods beverages
categories. The Company’s business is highly competitive as all of its brands compete for retail
shelf space with other advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label
products.

The

Jif

brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for over 20 years, while the
Company’s natural peanut butter business, sold under the

Smucker’s

,

Adam’s

, and

Laura Scudder’s

brands, maintains a strong leadership position in the natural peanut butter category.

Crisco

has been a leader
in the shortening and cooking oils category for over 50 years.

Crisco

holds the number one
position among branded competitors in both the oils and shortening categories. The oils category
in which

Crisco

competes is a more competitive category than the others in which the Company’s
brands compete due to a larger private label presence and more volatile commodity pricing. The
Company’s fruit spread brands, including

Smucker’s

and

Dickinson’s

, compete with three major
branded lines of fruit spreads and many private label brands. The competing brands exist on both a
national and regional level.

The Company competes in the dessert and baking mixes (“DBM”) market that includes mixes for
cakes, cookies, brownies, muffins, and quickbreads, as well as ready-to-spread frostings and
ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour. Within the DBM category, the Company competes
primarily with Betty Crocker, which is marketed by General Mills, Inc., and Duncan Hines, which is
marketed by



Pinnacle Food Group, Inc. The Company’s

Hungry Jack

brand competes in three primary market
categories: pancake mix, dehydrated potatoes, and table syrup. The Company competes primarily with
Aunt Jemima, which is marketed by PepsiCo’s Quaker Foods North America segment, in pancake mix and
table syrups, Mrs. Butterworth’s and Log Cabin which is marketed by Pinnacle Food Group, Inc., in
table syrups, and Betty Crocker in dehydrated potatoes.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, product and packaging innovations,
technological advances, and new industry techniques have all added additional variables for
companies in the food industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The principal methods
of and factors in competition are product quality, price, packaging, customer service, advertising,
and promotion. Positive factors pertaining to the Company’s competitive position include
well-recognized brands, strong brand management, varied product offerings, product innovation, and
a strong distribution network.

Research and Development

. The Company predominantly utilizes in-house resources to
both develop new products and improve existing products in each of its business areas. Amounts
expensed for product development approximated $10,397,000, $7,496,000, and $6,354,000 in 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively.

Environmental Matters

. Compliance with the provisions of federal, state, and local
environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the
protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon the Company’s capital
expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

However, on May 5, 2005, representatives from the California Environmental Protection Agency
Department of Toxic Substances Control (“CEPA”) informed Smucker Quality Beverages, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“SQB”), that CEPA is conducting an investigation to
identify a source area for chlorinated volatile organic compounds that have been found in domestic
water supply wells at residential properties near SQB’s property at Speedway Ave, Chico,
California. It is possible that CEPA will identify the SQB Chico property as a contributing
source of the contamination because of the operations of prior owners of the property. In such
event, SQB may be responsible for investigation and remediation expenses, the full amount of which
cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. The water used at the Chico facility and in the
manufacturing process is purified and does not contain chlorinated volatile organic compounds.

Employees

. At April 30, 2005, the Company had approximately 3,700 full-time
employees, worldwide. Approximately 1,400 of these employees, located at 12 facilities, are
covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. The Company
believes its relations with its current employees are generally good.

the Company are listed below. All executive officers serve at the pleasure of the Board of
