PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Company

. The J. M. Smucker Company (the “Company”) was established in 1897 and
was incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a registered
trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food
products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of the Company’s sales are in the U.S. The
Company’s operations outside the U.S. are principally in Canada although products are exported to
other countries as well. Sales outside the U.S. represented approximately 11 percent of total
consolidated Company sales for fiscal 2009. The Company’s branded food products include a strong
portfolio of trusted, iconic, market-leading brands that are sold to consumers through retail
outlets in North America.

On November 6, 2008, the Company completed a merger transaction with The Folgers Coffee
Company (“Folgers”), a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”). The value of the
transaction was approximately $3.7 billion, including the issuance of Smucker common shares in
connection with the merger and $350 million of Folgers debt. Under the terms of the transaction
agreements, P&G distributed common shares of Folgers to participating P&G shareholders which were
then automatically converted into the right to receive Smucker common shares in the merger.
Immediately following the merger, P&G shareholders and pre-merger Company shareholders owned
approximately 53.5 percent and 46.5 percent, respectively, of the Company’s approximately 118
million common shares outstanding. The merger was accounted for as a purchase business
combination, with the Company treated as the acquiring entity.

The Company has four reportable segments: U.S. retail consumer market, U.S. retail oils and
baking market, U.S. retail coffee market, and special markets. The Company’s three U.S. retail
market segments in total comprised nearly 80 percent of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2009 and
represent a major portion of the strategic focus area for the Company — the sale of branded food
products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in North America. The
special markets segment represents sales outside of the U.S. retail markets and includes the
Company’s Canada, foodservice, natural foods (formerly beverage), and international businesses.

Principal Products

. The principal products of the Company, which are sold across the
Company’s U.S. retail market segments and special markets segment, are coffee, peanut butter,
shortening and oils, fruit spreads, canned milk, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings, flour
and baking ingredients, juices and beverages, frozen sandwiches, dessert toppings, syrups, pickles
and condiments, and potato side dishes.

Product sales information for the years 2009, 2008, and 2007 is incorporated herein by
reference to information set forth in the Company’s 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 42
through 44 under “Note D: Reportable Segments.”

In each of the U.S. retail market segments, the Company’s products are primarily sold through
a combination of direct sales and through brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores,
club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, and military commissaries. In the
special markets segment, the Company’s products are distributed domestically and in foreign
countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (i.e., restaurants,
schools and universities, healthcare operators), health and natural foods stores and distributors.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

. The raw materials used by the Company in
each of its segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Glass, plastic,
steel cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate are the principal packaging materials used by the
Company. The fruit and
vegetable raw materials used by the Company in the production of its food products are purchased
from independent growers and suppliers. Green coffee, peanuts, oils, sweeteners, milk, wheat and
flour, corn, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The cost and availability
of many of these



commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. The
Company uses commodity futures and options to manage a significant portion of its commodity costs.
Green coffee is the world’s second largest traded commodity and is sourced solely from foreign
countries. Green coffee’s supply and price are subject to high volatility due to factors such as
weather, pest damage, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. Raw materials
are generally available from numerous sources, and the Company believes that it will continue to be
able to obtain adequate supplies. The Company has not historically encountered significant
shortages of key raw materials. The Company considers its relationship with key raw material
suppliers to be good.

Trademarks and Patents

. The Company’s products are produced under certain patents and
marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries.

The Company considers all of its intellectual property and the

Pillsbury®

,

Dunkin’ Donuts®

,

BORDEN®,

Elsie design,   and

Carnation®

licenses, taken as a whole, to be essential to its business.

Seasonality

. The Company’s U.S. retail oils and baking
market and U.S. retail coffee market
businesses are particularly seasonal around the “fall bake” and holiday period, which generally
results in higher sales and
profits in the Company’s second and third quarters. The Company’s success in promoting and
merchandising its baking and coffee brands during the “fall bake” and holiday period has a
significant impact on its results for a fiscal year. The back-to-school period and the spring
holiday season are two other important promotional periods for the Company, although their impact
to the Company is not as significant as the “fall bake” and holiday period.



Working Capital

. Working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of
the Company’s fiscal year mainly due to the timing of fruit and vegetable procurement, the buildup
of oil, baking, and coffee inventories necessary to support the
“fall bake” and holiday period, and the
additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Customers

. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries amounted to
approximately 24 percent, 20 percent, and 20 percent of net sales in 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segments. No other
customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2009, 2008, and 2007.

During 2009, the Company’s top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 61
percent of consolidated net sales reflecting consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years.
The Company expects industry consolidation to continue. Although the loss of any large customer
for an extended length of time could negatively impact the Company’s sales and profits, the Company
does not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for
the Company’s products.

Orders

. Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of
unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.

Government Business

. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to
negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition

. The Company is the branded market leader in the coffee, peanut butter,
shortening and oils, sweetened condensed milk, fruit spreads, dessert toppings, and health and
natural foods beverages categories. The Company’s business is highly competitive as all of its
U.S. retail market segments’ brands compete for retail shelf space with other advertised and
branded products as well as unadvertised and private label products.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, product and packaging innovations,
technological advances, and new industry techniques are all issues for companies in the food
industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The primary ways in which products are
distinguished are product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value,
convenience, customer service, advertising, and promotion. Positive factors pertaining to the
Company’s competitive position include well-recognized brands, superior product quality,
experienced brand management, a single national grocery broker in the United States, varied product
offerings, product innovation, and a strong distribution network.

The Company historically has seen accelerated private label growth during challenging economic
times. During 2009, private label gained share of market in most categories within the grocery
store in which the Company competes. The Company estimates that during the current economic
recession, private label has grown more than during past recessions partly due to the unprecedented
run up in commodity costs combined with improvements in private label quality. The Company
believes that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food
categories in which it competes, appealing to different consumer segments. The Company closely
monitors the price gap or price premium between its brands and private label, with the view that
value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an
integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets.

In the consumer segment, the

Jif®

brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for
over 20 years, while the Company’s natural peanut butter business, sold under the

Smucker’s®

,

Adam’s®

, and

Laura Scudder’s®

brands, maintains a strong leadership position in the natural peanut
butter category. The Company’s fruit spread brands, including

Smucker’s®, Dickinson’s®

, and

Knott’s Berry Farm®

hold the leading position in the fruit spreads category and compete with
Welch’s branded line of fruit spreads and many private label brands. The competing brands exist on
both a national and a regional level. The Company’s

Hungry Jack®

brand competes in three primary
market categories: pancake mix, potato side



dishes, and table syrup. The Company competes with
several major national as well as private label brands in these categories.

In the oils and baking segment,

Crisco®

has been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils
categories for over 50 years.

Crisco®

holds a leading position among branded competitors in both
the oils and shortening categories. The oils category in which

Crisco®

competes is a more
competitive category due to a significant private label presence and volatile commodity pricing.
The Company’s

Pillsbury®

brand competes in the dessert and baking mixes (“DBM”) market that
includes mixes for cakes, cookies, brownies, muffins, and quick breads, as well as ready-to-spread
frostings and ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour. Within the DBM category, the
Company competes primarily with the Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines brands and many private label
brands. The Company competes in the canned milk category with both branded and nonbranded
products. The Company is the branded market leader in the sweetened condensed category with over
50 percent market share with its

Eagle Brand®

and

Magnolia®

brands; and, has significant sales with
production of private label brands. In the evaporated milk category, the Company has a significant
presence with its production of private label brands and the

PET®

brand where it competes primarily
with one major national brand.

In the coffee segment, the

Folgers®

brand competes in the highly competitive U.S. packaged
roast and ground coffee market with other retail coffee roasters such as Maxwell House, Yuban,
General Foods International Coffee, Starbucks and Seattle’s Best, and others. The Company also
competes in the premium gourmet coffee market through its

Millstone®

,

Folgers Gourmet Selections®

brands, as well as through sales of

Dunkin’ Donuts®

licensed retail packaged coffee products. The
Company’s coffee business also faces competition from the specialty or gourmet away-from-home
coffee market, a significant market in the coffee industry and a market in which the Company does
not compete.

Research and Development

. The Company predominantly utilizes in-house resources to
both develop new products and improve existing products in each of its business areas. Amounts
expensed for product development were $14,498,000, $9,547,000, and $9,680,000 in 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively.

Environmental Matters

. Compliance with the provisions of federal, state, and local
environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the
protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon the Company’s capital
expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Employees

. At April 30, 2009, the Company had approximately 4,700 full-time
employees, worldwide. Approximately 34 percent of these employees, located at 11 facilities, are
covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. The Company
believes its relations with its current employees are good.

Financial Information about Industry Segments and Geographical Areas

. The financial
information required to be included in this item concerning reportable industry segments and
international operations for the years 2009, 2008, and 2007 is incorporated herein by reference to
information set forth in the Company’s 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 42 through 44,
under “Note D: Reportable Segments.” The Company’s international operations are primarily in
Canada with risks similar to those
associated with the U.S. retail markets. The Company’s Canada sales primarily represent the
sale of Canadian produced products to Canadian customers.

Forward-Looking Statements

. This report includes forward-looking statements that are
based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from expected or projected results. The descriptions of
risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements is incorporated herein by reference
to information set forth in the Company’s 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption
“Forward-Looking Statements” on page 27.



Available Information

. Access to all Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
filings made by the Company, including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, is provided, free of charge, on the Company’s Web site
(www.smuckers.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed
with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The Company’s business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks and
uncertainties. The risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with the
other information contained or incorporated by reference in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in
the Company’s other filings with the SEC, in connection with evaluating the Company, its business
and the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. Additional risks and uncertainties
not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may affect
the Company. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse
impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.













•

The anticipated benefits from the Folgers transaction may not be realized.

The Company may not realize the full benefits of the increased sales volume and other
benefits that are currently expected to result from the Folgers transaction, or realize
these benefits within the time frame that is currently expected. For example, the
elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated. In
addition, the benefits of the Folgers transaction may be offset by operating losses relating
to changes in commodity or energy prices, increased competition, or by other risks and
uncertainties. If the Company fails to realize the benefits it anticipates from the Folgers
transaction, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely affected.

•

Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the Company’s ability to
access capital in the future.

The Company may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct its operations,
expand its business or refinance existing indebtedness. Recent disruptions in global
financial markets and banking systems have made credit and capital markets more difficult for
companies to access, even for some companies with established revolving or other credit
facilities. Any sustained weakness in the general economic conditions and/or financial
markets in the United States or globally could affect adversely the Company’s ability to
raise capital on favorable terms or at all. From time to time the Company has relied, and
also may rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for
working capital requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The Company’s
access to funds under its revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the
financial institutions that are parties to those facilities to meet their funding
commitments. The obligations of the financial institutions under the Company’s revolving
credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or
more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. Longer term volatility and
continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing
or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives or failure of
significant financial institutions could affect adversely the Company’s access to the
liquidity needed for its businesses in the longer term. Such disruptions could require the
Company to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative
credit arrangements or other funding for its business needs can be arranged. The disruptions
in the capital and credit markets also have resulted in higher interest rates on publicly
issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities. Continuation of these
disruptions would increase the Company’s interest expense and capital costs and could affect
adversely its results of operations and financial position.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.
