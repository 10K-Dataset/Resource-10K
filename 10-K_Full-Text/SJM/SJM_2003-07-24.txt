PART I

Item 1. Business

The
Company

. The J. M. Smucker Company was established in 1897 and was
incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a
registered trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing
and marketing of branded food products on a worldwide basis although the
majority of the Company’s sales are in the United States. The Company’s
distribution outside the United States is principally in Canada, Australia, and
Brazil although products are exported to other countries as well.
International sales represent less than ten percent of total consolidated
Company sales for fiscal 2003.

On June 1, 2002, the Company merged the

Jif

peanut butter and

Crisco

shortening and oils businesses of The Procter & Gamble Company with and into
the Company. Information regarding the merger is hereby incorporated by
reference from the 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders, on page 28 under “Note
C: Merger.” As a result of the

Jif

and

Crisco

merger, the Company realigned
its reportable business segment structure resulting in two new segments: U.S.
retail market and special markets. The U.S. retail market includes the
consumer and consumer oils businesses and represents the primary strategic
focus area for the Company – the sale of branded food products with leadership
positions to consumers through mainstream domestic retail outlets. The special
markets segment represents the aggregation of the foodservice, international,
industrial, and beverage businesses. Prior year segment information has been
restated to conform to the new structure.

Principal Products

. The principal products of the Company are peanut
butter, shortening and oils, fruit spreads, industrial fruit products, fruit
and vegetable juices, beverages, dessert toppings, and syrups.

Product sale information for the years 2003, 2002, and 2001 is hereby
incorporated by reference from the 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages
29 through 31, under “Note E: Reportable Segments.”

In the U.S. retail market the Company’s products are primarily sold
through brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, club stores, mass
merchandisers, and military commissaries. In the special markets, the
Company’s products are distributed through foreign countries, foodservice
distributors and operators (i.e., restaurants, schools and universities,
healthcare operators), other food manufacturers, and health and natural food
stores.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

. The fruit raw materials used
by the Company in the production of its food products are purchased from
independent growers and suppliers. Sweeteners, peanuts, oils, and other
ingredients are obtained from various other sources.

Trademarks and Patents

. The Company’s products are produced under certain
patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned by the Company or one of
its subsidiaries. Major trademarks, primarily utilized in the U.S. retail
market include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco, Simply Jif, Dickinson’s, Adams, Laura
Scudder’s, Goober, Simply 100% Fruit, Magic Shell, Sundae Syrup, Smucker’s
Snackers,

and

Uncrustables.

Major trademarks primarily utilized in the special
markets include:

Smucker’s, R. W. Knudsen Family, After The Fall, Simply
Nutritious, Recharge, Santa Cruz Organic, Spritzer, IXL,

and

Double Fruit

. In
addition, the Company or one of its subsidiaries licenses the use of several
other trademarks, none of which individually is material to the Company’s
business.

Other slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include
(without limitation) the slogan, “With a name like Smucker’s

,

it has to be
good,” “Over 100 Years of Family-Made Goodness,”



“Choosy Moms Choose Jif,” the

Smucker’s

banner, the Crock Jar shape, the Gingham design, and the Strawberry
logo.

The Company considers all of these trademarks to be essential to its
business.

Seasonality

. Historically, the Company’s business has not been highly
seasonal. The Company’s

Crisco

business is somewhat seasonal around the fall
bake period and as a result impacts sales and profits in the Company’s second
and third quarters. The overall impact however, is not considered significant.

Working Capital

. The addition of the

Jif

and

Crisco

businesses has had a
positive impact on working capital. Prior to the merger, the Company’s working
capital requirements were greatest during the late spring and summer months due
to seasonal procurement of fruits. Raw material inventories for

Jif

and

Crisco

businesses are purchased and used throughout the course of the fiscal year,
thus favorably impacting working capital.

Customers

. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries amounted
to approximately 14 percent of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2003. These
sales are included primarily in the U.S. retail market. No other customer
exceeded ten percent of consolidated net sales for any year.

Orders

. Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the
backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time is not and, has not, during
the Company’s just ended fiscal year, been material.

Government Business

. No material portion of the Company’s business is
subject to negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election
of the government.

Competition

. The Company is the branded market leader in the peanut
butter, shortening and oils, fruit spreads, dessert toppings, and health and
natural foods beverages categories. The Company’s business is highly
competitive as all of its brands compete for retail shelf space with other
advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label
products.

The

Jif

brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for over 20
years. The

Jif

brand is marked by its distinct product differentiation (“more
fresh roasted peanut taste”) and a consistent advertising campaign (“Choosy
Moms Choose Jif”).

Crisco

has been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils
category for over 50 years.

Crisco

holds the number one position among branded
competitors across all retail channels in both the oils and shortening
categories. The oils category in which

Crisco

competes is a more competitive
category than the others in which the Company’s brands compete due to a larger
private label presence and more volatile commodity pricing. The Company’s
fruit spread brands compete with three major branded lines of fruit spreads and
many private label brands. The competing brands exist on both a national and
regional level.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, consolidation of
retailers, manufacturers, and brokers within the food industry, and changes in
business practices, resulting from both technological advances and new industry
techniques, have all added additional variables for companies in the food
industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The principal methods of
and factors in competition are product quality, price, packaging, customer
service, advertising, and promotion. Positive factors pertaining to the
Company’s competitive position include well-recognized brands, strong brand
management, varied product offerings, and a strong distribution network.

Research and Development

. The Company predominantly utilizes in-house
resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of
its business areas. In relation to consolidated assets and operating expenses,
amounts expensed for research and development in each of the areas and in the
aggregate were not material in any of the last three years.



Environmental Matters

. Compliance with the provisions of federal, state,
and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials
into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to
have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive
position of the Company.

Employees

. At April 30, 2003, the Company had approximately 2,775
full-time employees, worldwide. Approximately 760 of these employees, located
at six facilities, are covered by union contracts between the Company and the
Teamsters. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. The
Company believes its relations with its current employees are generally good.

Segment and Geographic Information

. Information concerning reportable
segments including international operations for the years 2003, 2002, and 2001
is hereby incorporated by reference from the 2003 Annual Report to
Shareholders, on pages 29 through 31, under “Note E: Reportable Segments.”

Certain Forward-Looking Statements

. This report includes certain
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are hereby incorporated by
reference from the Company’s 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders under “Certain
Forward-Looking Statements” on page 17.

Web site Access to Reports

. Access to all SEC filings made by the Company
is provided, free of charge, on the Company’s Web site (www.smuckers.com) as
soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with
the SEC.



Item 2. Properties

The table below lists all the Company’s manufacturing and fruit processing
facilities. All of the Company’s properties are maintained and updated on a
regular basis, and the Company continues to make investment for expansion and
technological improvements. The Company believes that existing capacity at
these facilities is sufficient to sustain current operations and anticipated
growth.

The properties listed below are owned, except for the West Fargo, North
Dakota, location, which is leased. There are no material performance
obligations associated with the properties listed below. The corporate
headquarters are located in Orrville, Ohio. The locations indicated by an
asterisk are currently expected to close during fiscal 2004 or 2005 as part of
the Company’s restructuring plans as described in the Company’s 2003 Annual
Report to Shareholders under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” on pages
12 through 17. A new

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding that would be
considered material. Subsequent to May 1, 2003, the Company has, however, been
served with complaints in several class action suits involving its

Simply 100%
Fruit

product. As these cases are only in the very initial stages, and because
these complaints seek damages and attorneys’ fees in unspecified amounts, the
Company is unable to determine their materiality. The Company believes these
suits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend these actions.

Item 4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
