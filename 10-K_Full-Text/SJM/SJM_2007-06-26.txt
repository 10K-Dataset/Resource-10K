PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Company

. The J. M. Smucker Company (the “Company”) was established in 1897
and was incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a registered
trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food
products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of the Company’s sales are in the United
States. The Company’s operations outside the United States are principally in Canada although
products are exported to other countries as well. Sales outside the United States represent
approximately 15 percent of total consolidated Company sales for fiscal 2007.

The Company has two reportable segments: U.S. retail market and special markets. The
Company’s U.S. retail market segment, comprising over 70 percent of the Company’s net sales,
includes the consumer and consumer oils and baking businesses and represents a large portion of the
strategic focus area for the Company – the sale of branded food products with leadership positions
to consumers through retail outlets in North America. The special markets segment represents the
aggregation of the foodservice, beverage, Canada, and international businesses.

On September 22, 2006, the Company sold its Canadian nonbranded, grain-based foodservice and
industrial businesses.

On May 1, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of Eagle Family Foods Holdings, Inc.
(“Eagle”). Information regarding the acquisition is incorporated herein by reference to
information set forth in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report to
Shareholders, on page 39 and 40 under “Note B:
Subsequent Event – Eagle Acquisition.”

Principal Products

. The principal products of the Company, which are sold in both the
Company’s U.S. retail market segment and special markets segment, are peanut butter, shortening and
oils, flour and baking ingredients, fruit spreads, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings,
fruit and vegetable juices, beverages, dessert toppings, syrups, frozen sandwiches, pickles and
condiments, and potato side dishes. With the completion of the Eagle acquisition, the principal
products of the Company will also include canned milk.

Product sales information for the years 2007, 2006, and 2005 is incorporated herein by
reference to information set forth in the Company’s 2007 Annual
Report to Shareholders, on pages 43
through 45 under “Note F: Reportable Segments.”

In the U.S. retail market segment, the Company’s products are primarily sold through brokers
to food retailers, food wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount stores, and military
commissaries. In the special markets segment, the Company’s products are distributed domestically
and in foreign countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (i.e.,
restaurants, schools and universities, healthcare operators), other food manufacturers, health and
natural foods stores and distributors.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

. The raw materials used by the Company in
each of its segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Glass, plastic,
caps, carton board, and corrugate are the principal packaging materials used by the Company. The
fruit, organic fruit, pickle, and condiment raw materials used by the Company in the production of
its food products are purchased from independent growers and suppliers. Sweeteners, peanuts, oils,
wheat and flour, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The cost and
availability of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over
time. The Company also uses commodity futures and options to hedge some of its costs. Raw
materials are available from numerous sources, and the Company believes that it will continue to be
able to obtain adequate supplies. The Company has not historically encountered shortages of key
raw materials. The Company considers its relationship with key raw material suppliers to be good.



Trademarks and Patents

. The Company’s products are produced under certain patents and
marketed under numerous trademarks owned by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Major
trademarks, utilized primarily in the U.S. retail market segment, include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco,
Mary Ellen, Dutch Girl, Martha White, LaPina, White Lily, Hungry Jack, Uncrustables, Simply Jif,
Golden Temple, Softasilk, Dickinson’s, Crosse & Blackwell, Funfetti, Adams, Laura Scudder’s,
Goober, Pet, Magic Shell,

and

Simple Measures.

Major trademarks primarily utilized in the special
markets segment include:

Smucker’s, Jif, Crisco, Plate Scapers, Bick’s, Five Roses, Robin Hood, R.
W. Knudsen Family, Santa Cruz Organic, Double Fruit, Simply Nutritious, Recharge,

and

Red River

.
Pillsbury, the Pillsbury Barrelhead logo, and Pillsbury Doughboy are trademarks of The Pillsbury
Company, used by the Company under a 20-year, perpetually renewable, royalty-free license. In
addition, the Company or one of its subsidiaries licenses the use of several other trademarks, none
of which individually is material to the Company’s business.

Slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include (without limitation) the
slogan,

“With A Name Like Smucker’s, It Has To Be Good,” “Choosy Moms Choose Jif,” “Purely The
Finest,” “Kids Bake It Fun,” “Start Something Good with Crisco,” “We’ve Got Ice Cream Covered,”
”Everybody’s Happy When It’s Hungry Jack,” “Goodness Gracious, It’s Good,” “A Southern Family
Tradition,”

the

Smucker’s

banner, the Crock Jar shape, the Gingham design, and the Strawberry logo.

The Company considers all of these trademarks and the Pillsbury license to be essential to its
business.

With the completion of the Eagle acquisition, the Company will also utilize

Eagle Brand

and

Magnolia

trademarks primarily in the U.S. retail market segment. In addition, the

BORDEN

and

Elsie

trademarks may also be used by the Company on certain products under a perpetual, exclusive, and
royalty-free license.

Seasonality

. The Company’s consumer oils and baking business is moderately seasonal
around the “fall bake” period, which generally impacts sales and profits in the Company’s second
and third quarters. The completion of the Eagle acquisition is expected to add to this
seasonality. The overall impact of seasonal trends, however, is not considered significant.

Working Capital

. Working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of
the Company’s fiscal year mainly due to the timing of fruit and pickle procurement and the buildup
of inventories necessary to support the “fall bake” season.

Customers

. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries amounted to
approximately 20 percent, 18 percent, and 16 percent of net sales in 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segment. No other
customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2007, 2006, and 2005.

Orders

. Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of
unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.

Government Business

. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to
negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition

. The Company is the branded market leader in the peanut butter,
shortening and oils, fruit spreads, dessert toppings, and health and natural foods beverages
categories. The Company’s business is highly competitive as all of its brands compete for retail
shelf space with other advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label
products.

The

Jif

brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for over 20 years, while the
Company’s natural peanut butter business, sold under the

Smucker’s

,

Adam’s

, and

Laura Scudder’s



brands, maintains a strong leadership position in the natural peanut butter category.

Crisco

has
been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories for over 50 years.

Crisco

holds a
leading position among branded competitors in both the oils and shortening categories. The oils
category in which

Crisco

competes is a more competitive category due to a larger private label
presence and volatile commodity pricing. The Company’s fruit spread brands, including

Smucker’s

and

Dickinson’s

, hold the leading position in the category and compete with one major branded line
of fruit spreads and many private label brands. The competing brands exist on both a national and
a regional level.

The Company competes in the dessert and baking mixes (“DBM”) market that includes mixes for
cakes, cookies, brownies, muffins, and quick breads, as well as ready-to-spread frostings and
ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour. Within the DBM category, the Company competes
primarily with two major national and many private label brands. The Company’s

Hungry Jack

brand
competes in three primary market categories: pancake mix, potato side dishes, and table syrup. The
Company competes with several major national as well private label brands in these categories.

With the completion of the Eagle acquisition, the Company competes in the canned milk category
with both branded and nonbranded products. The Company is the branded market leader in the
sweetened condensed category with over 50 percent market share with its

Eagle Brand

and

Magnolia

brands. In the evaporated milk category, the Company has a significant presence with its
production of private label brands where it competes primarily with one major national brand.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, product and packaging innovations,
technological advances, and new industry techniques have all added additional variables for
companies in the food industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The primary ways in
which products are distinguished are product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions,
nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and promotion. Positive factors
pertaining to the Company’s competitive position include well-recognized brands, superior product
quality, experienced brand management, varied product offerings, product innovation, and a strong
distribution network.

Research and Development

. The Company predominantly utilizes in-house resources to
both develop new products and improve existing products in each of its business areas. Amounts
expensed for product development were $9,680,000, $10,781,000, and $10,397,000 in 2007, 2006, and
2005, respectively.

Environmental Matters

. Compliance with the provisions of federal, state, and local
environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the
protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon the Company’s capital
expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

The Company is currently involved with an environmental investigation at one of its production
facilities. The former owner of the site is also involved in the investigation and is expected to
have primary responsibility for the site remediation. Due to uncertainties surrounding the
environmental investigation and the nature and extent of remediation, the Company’s liability
cannot be reasonably estimated and measured at this time, but the Company does not anticipate the
liability to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Employees

. At April 30, 2007, the Company had approximately 3,025 full-time
employees, worldwide. Approximately 31 percent of these employees, located at eight facilities,
are covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. The
Company believes its relations with its current employees are generally good. The Company added
approximately 150 additional full-time employees with the completion of the Eagle acquisition.
Approximately 70 of the Eagle employees, located at one facility, are covered by union contracts.

Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographical Areas

. The financial
information required to be included in this item concerning reportable industry segments and
international operations for the years 2007, 2006, and 2005 is incorporated herein by reference to
information set forth



in the
Company’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 43
through 45, under “Note F:
Reportable Segments.” The Company’s international operations are primarily in Canada with risks
similar to those associated with the U.S. retail market segment. The Company’s Canada sales
primarily represent the sale of Canadian produced products to Canadian customers.

Forward-Looking Statements

. This report includes forward-looking statements that are
based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from expected or projected results. The descriptions of
risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements is incorporated herein by reference
to information set forth in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption
“Forward-Looking Statements” on page 24.

Available Information

. Access to all Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
filings made by the Company, including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, is provided, free of charge, on the Company’s Web site
(www.smuckers.com/fc/investor/) as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are
electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The Company’s business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks
and uncertainties. The risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with
the other information contained or incorporated by reference in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and
in the Company’s other filings with the SEC, in connection with evaluating the Company, its
business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial
also may affect the Company. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a
material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

•

The Company operates in the competitive food industry and relies on continued demand for
the Company’s products.

The Company faces competition across its product lines from other food companies with the
primary methods and factors in competition being product quality, price, packaging, new
product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and
promotion. In order to generate future revenues and profits, the Company must continue to
sell products that appeal to the Company’s customers and consumers. Specifically, there are
a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact the Company and the food industry
as a whole including convenience, consumer dietary trends, and obesity, health and
nutritional concerns. Continued success is dependent on product innovation, the ability to
secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space, and effective trade merchandising,
advertising, and marketing programs. Some of the Company’s competitors have substantial
financial, marketing, and other resources, and competition with them in the Company’s various
markets and product lines could cause the Company to reduce prices, increase marketing or
other expenditures, or lose category share. Category share and growth could be adversely
impacted if the Company is not successful in introducing new products.

•

The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry.

The food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product
tampering, product recall, and consumer product liability claims. The Company’s operations
could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding the Company’s and
competitors’ products. In the event of product contamination or tampering, the Company may
need to recall some of its products. A widespread product recall could result in significant
loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and
the loss of sales resulting from







Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.
