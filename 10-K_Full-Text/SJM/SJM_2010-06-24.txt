PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Company

. The J. M. Smucker Company (the “Company”) was established in 1897
and was incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as

Smucker’s

(a registered
trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food
products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of the Company’s sales are in the U.S. The
Company’s operations outside the U.S. are principally in Canada although products are exported to
other countries as well. Sales outside the U.S. represented approximately 10 percent of total
consolidated Company sales for fiscal 2010. The Company’s branded food products include a strong
portfolio of trusted, iconic, market-leading brands that are sold to consumers through retail
outlets in North America.

On November 6, 2008, the Company completed a merger transaction with The Folgers Coffee
Company (“Folgers”), a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”). The value of the
transaction was approximately $3.7 billion, including the issuance of common shares of the Company
in connection with the merger and $350 million of Folgers debt. Under the terms of the transaction
agreements, P&G distributed common shares of Folgers to participating P&G shareholders which were
then automatically converted into the right to receive common shares of the Company in the merger.
Immediately following the merger, P&G shareholders and pre-merger Company shareholders owned
approximately 53.5 percent and 46.5 percent, respectively, of the Company’s approximately 118
million common shares outstanding. The merger was accounted for as a purchase business
combination, with the Company treated as the acquiring entity.

The Company has four reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee Market, U.S. Retail Consumer
Market, U.S. Retail Oils and Baking Market, and Special Markets. The Company’s three U.S. retail
market segments in total comprised over 80 percent of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2010 and
represent a major portion of the strategic focus area for the Company — the sale of branded food
products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in North America. The
Special Markets segment represents sales outside of the U.S. retail markets and includes the
Company’s Canada, foodservice, natural foods (formerly beverage), and international businesses.

Principal Products

. The principal products of the Company, which are sold across the
Company’s U.S. retail market segments and Special Markets segment, are coffee, peanut butter,
shortening and oils, fruit spreads, canned milk, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings, flour
and baking ingredients, juices and beverages, frozen sandwiches, dessert toppings, syrups, and
pickles and condiments.

Product sales information for the years 2010, 2009, and 2008 is incorporated herein by
reference to information set forth in the Company’s 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 43
through 45 under “Note D: Reportable Segments.”

In each of the U.S. retail market segments, the Company’s products are primarily sold through
a combination of direct sales and through brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores,
club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, and military commissaries. In the
Special Markets segment, the Company’s products are distributed domestically and in foreign
countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants,
schools and universities, and healthcare operators), health and natural foods stores and
distributors.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

. The raw materials used by the Company in
each of its segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Glass, plastic,
steel cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate are the principal packaging materials used by the
Company. The fruit and vegetable raw materials used by the Company in the production of its food
products are purchased from
independent growers and suppliers. Green coffee, peanuts, edible oils, sweeteners, milk, flour,
corn, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The costs of many of these
commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. The Company uses basis
contracts, and commodity



futures and options to manage price volatility for a significant portion
of its commodity costs. Green coffee is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and
price are subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, pest damage, and political and
economic conditions in the source countries. Raw materials are generally available from numerous
sources although the Company has elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single
sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary year-to-year, the
Company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives
to single-sourced materials are available. The Company has not historically encountered
significant shortages of key raw materials. The Company considers its relationship with key raw
material suppliers to be good.

Trademarks and Patents

. The Company’s products are produced under certain patents and
marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries.

The Company owns several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets,
technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

The Company considers all of its intellectual property and the

Pillsbury®

,

Dunkin’ Donuts®

,

BORDEN®

and Elsie design, and

Carnation®

licenses, taken as a whole, to be essential to its
business.

Seasonality

. The Company’s U.S. Retail Coffee Market and U.S. Retail Oils and Baking
Market businesses are particularly seasonal around the “fall bake” and holiday period, which
generally results in
higher sales and profits in the Company’s second and third quarters. The Company’s success in
promoting and merchandising its baking and coffee brands during the “fall bake” and holiday period
has a significant impact on its results for a fiscal year. The back-to-school period and the
spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods for the Company, although their
impact to the Company is not as significant as the “fall bake” and holiday period.



Working Capital

. Working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of
the Company’s fiscal year mainly due to the timing of fruit and vegetable procurement, the buildup
of coffee, oil, and baking inventories necessary to support the “fall bake” and holiday period, and
the further buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Customers

. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries amounted to
approximately 27 percent, 24 percent, and 20 percent of net sales in 2010, 2009, and 2008,
respectively. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segments. No other
customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2010, 2009, and 2008.

During 2010, the Company’s top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 58
percent of consolidated net sales. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length
of time could negatively impact the Company’s sales and profits, the Company does not anticipate
that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for the Company’s
products.

Orders

. Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of
unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.

Government Business

. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition

. The Company is the branded market leader in the coffee, peanut butter,
shortening, sweetened condensed milk, fruit spreads, dessert toppings, and health and natural foods
beverages categories. The Company’s business is highly competitive as all of its U.S. retail
market segments’ brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as
private label products.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, product and packaging innovations,
technological advances, and new industry techniques are all issues for companies in the food
industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The primary ways in which products are
distinguished are product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value,
convenience, advertising, and promotion. Positive factors pertaining to the Company’s competitive
position include well-recognized brands, superior product quality, experienced brand management, a
single national grocery broker in the U.S., varied product offerings, product innovation, excellent
customer service, and a strong distribution network.

The Company historically has seen accelerated private label growth during challenging economic
times. The Company estimates that during the economic recession of the past two years, private
label grew more than during past recessions partly due to the unprecedented run up in commodity
costs, increased emphasis by retailers, and improvements in private label quality. The Company
believes that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food
categories in which it competes, appealing to different consumer segments. The Company closely
monitors the price gap or price premium between its brands and private label, with the view that
value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an
integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets.

In the U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment, the

Folgers®

brand competes in the highly
competitive U.S. packaged roast and ground coffee market with other retail coffee roasters such as
Maxwell House,
Yuban, and Nescafe. The Company also competes in the premium gourmet coffee market through its

Millstone®

and

Folgers® Gourmet Selections

TM

brands, as well as through sales of

Dunkin’
Donuts®

licensed retail packaged coffee products with other brands such as Starbucks, Eight
O’Clock, and Seattle’s Best. During 2010, the Company entered into a manufacturing and
distribution agreement with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. and Keurig, Inc. for the
introduction of

Folgers® Gourmet Selections

TM

and

Millstone®

premium coffees through
Keurig’s innovative

K-Cup®

coffee system. Introduction of the Company’s

K-Cup®

products is
expected in the fall of 2010.



In the U.S. Retail Consumer Market segment, the

Jif®

brand has been a leader in the peanut
butter category for over 20 years, while the Company’s natural peanut butter business, sold under
the

Smucker’s®

,

Adam’s®

,

Laura Scudder’s®

and

Jif®

brands, maintains a strong leadership position
in the natural peanut butter category. The Company’s fruit spread brands, including

Smucker’s®,
Dickinson’s®

, and

Knott’s Berry Farm®,

hold the leading position in the fruit spreads category and
compete with Welch’s branded line of fruit spreads and many private label brands. The competing
brands exist on both a national and a regional level. The Company’s

Hungry Jack®

brand competes in
the pancake mix and table syrup category. The Company competes with several major national as well
as private label brands in these categories. During 2010, the Company divested its potato side
dish product line and entered into a licensing agreement with the purchaser for their use of the

Hungry Jack®

brand. The Company maintains ownership of the brand.

In the U.S. Retail Oils and Baking Market segment,

Crisco®

has historically been a leader in
the shortening and cooking oils categories.

Crisco®

holds the leading branded position in the
shortening category and competes with other branded competitors for the leading branded position in
the oils category. The oils category in which

Crisco®

competes is highly competitive with private
label competitors maintaining the largest share of the category. The category is also
significantly impacted by volatile commodity pricing. The Company’s

Pillsbury®

brand competes in
the dessert and baking mixes (“DBM”) market that includes mixes for cakes, cookies, brownies,
muffins, and quick breads, as well as ready-to-spread frostings and ingredients used in scratch
baking such as flour. Within the DBM category, the Company competes primarily with the Betty
Crocker and Duncan Hines brands and many private label and regional brands. The Company competes
in the canned milk category with both branded and nonbranded products. The Company is the branded
market leader in the sweetened condensed category with its

Eagle Brand®

and

Magnolia®

brands and
has significant sales with production of private label brands. In the evaporated milk category,
the Company has a significant presence with its production of private label brands and the

Pet®

brand where it competes primarily with one major national brand.

Research and Development

. The Company predominantly utilizes in-house resources to
both develop new products and improve existing products in each of its business areas. Amounts
expensed for product development were $20,963,000, $14,498,000, and $9,547,000 in 2010, 2009, and
2008, respectively.

Environmental Matters

. The Company considers environmental sustainability to be its
responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area for the Company. The
Company has implemented and manages a variety of programs, including the utilization of renewable
energy technology, improved wastewater management, increased usage of sustainable raw materials,
and reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones, in support of its commitment to
environmental sustainability. The Company continues to evaluate and modify its processes on an
ongoing basis to further reduce its impact on the environment and reduce waste.

Compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal, state, and local environmental
regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of
the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon the Company’s capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive position in 2011.

Employees

. At April 30, 2010, the Company had approximately 4,850 full-time
employees, worldwide. Approximately 32 percent of these employees, located at 10 facilities, are
covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on the location. The Company
believes its relations with its current employees are good.

•

The Company operates in the competitive food industry and relies on continued demand for
the Company’s products.

The Company faces competition across its product lines from other food companies with the
primary methods and factors in competition being product quality, price, packaging, new
product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, customer service, advertising, and
promotion. In order to generate future revenues and profits, the Company must continue to
sell products that appeal to the Company’s customers and consumers. Specifically, there are
a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact the Company and the food industry
as a whole including convenience, consumer dietary trends, and obesity, health and
nutritional concerns.

In particular, consumers, public health officials, and government officials are becoming
increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with weight
management, particularly among young people. Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the
health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and
acceptance
of some of the Company’s products and marketing programs. Although the Company strives to
respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, it may not be successful in these
efforts. Increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer
preferences could decrease demand for the Company’s products and adversely affect the
Company’s profitability.

Continued success is dependent on product innovation, the ability to secure and maintain
adequate retail shelf space, and effective trade merchandising, advertising, and marketing
programs. Some of the Company’s competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other
resources, and competition with them in the Company’s various markets and product lines could
cause the Company to reduce prices, increase marketing or other expenditures, or lose
category share. Category share and growth could be adversely impacted if the Company is not
successful in introducing new products.

law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings

affected product to the requirement of a warning label. Products containing listed
substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a
municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. If the Company is
required to add warning labels to any of its products or place warnings in certain locations
where its products are sold as a result of Proposition 65, sales of those products could
suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere.
