Business Segments

We conduct our business through three segments. Through our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, we are a leading distributor of ethical and
proprietary drugs, and health and beauty care products throughout North
America. This segment also manufactures and sells automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems for hospitals and retail pharmacies, medical management and
specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical
manufacturers, patient and payor services, consulting and outsourcing services
to pharmacies and distribution of first-aid products in the United States. Our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distributes medical-surgical supplies and
equipment, and provides logistics and related services within the United
States. Our Information Solutions segment delivers enterprise-wide patient
care, clinical, financial, supply chain, managed care and strategic management
software solutions, as well as outsourcing and other services, to healthcare
organizations throughout North America, the United Kingdom and other European
countries. The Company’s strategy is to create strong, value-based
relationships with customers, enabling us to sell additional products and
services to these customers over time.

In response to changes in our business environment, in April 2004 the
Company reorganized certain businesses within these reportable segments. Our
2004 Form 10-K has been prepared based on operating segments in effect at March
31, 2004. Supplemental financial information regarding our operating segments
under our new organizational structure is included under the caption “2005
Operating Segments” as presented in the Financial Review included in Part II,
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition”.

Information Solutions

Our Information Solutions segment provides a comprehensive portfolio of
software, support and services to help healthcare organizations improve patient
safety, reduce the cost and variability of care, and better manage their
resources and revenue stream. The segment markets its products and services to
integrated delivery networks, hospitals, physician group practices, home health
providers, managed care providers and payors. Approximately sixty percent of
hospital-based integrated delivery networks in the U.S. use one or more
products from this segment. The segment also sells its solutions
internationally through subsidiaries and/or distribution agreements in Canada,
the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand
and Puerto Rico.

The product portfolio for the Information Solutions segment is organized
into three major solutions sets – clinical management, revenue cycle management
and resource management – with a variety of subsets of these solutions designed
to address specific healthcare business issues (e.g., physician access,
medication safety, etc.). To ensure that organizations achieve the maximum
value for their information technology investment, the Information Solutions
segment also offers a wide range of services to support the implementation and
use of solutions as well as assist with business and clinical re-design,
process re-engineering and staffing (both information technology and
back-office).

Clinical management

. The segment’s clinical solutions are designed to
enable organizations to improve medication safety, accelerate physician
utilization of healthcare information technology and reduce variability in
healthcare quality and costs. The clinical management solution set, known as
Horizon Clinicals

TM

, is built using architecture to facilitate integration and
enable modular deployment of systems. It includes a clinical data repository,
document imaging, medical imaging, real-time decision support, point-of-care
nursing documentation, enterprise laboratory and pharmacy, an emergency
department solution and an ambulatory medical record. Horizon
Clinicals

TM

also
includes solutions to facilitate physician access to patient information such
as a Web-based physician portal and wireless devices that draw on information
from the hospital’s information systems.

Revenue cycle management

. The segment’s revenue cycle solution is
designed to reduce days in accounts receivable, prevent insurance claim
denials, reduce costs and improve productivity for our customers. Examples of
solutions include contract management, electronic claims processing and coding
compliance checking. The segment’s hospital information systems also play a
key role in revenue cycle management by working with these solutions to
automate the operation of individual departments and their respective functions
within the inpatient environment.

Resource management

. The segment’s resource management solutions consist
of an integrated suite of applications that enhance an organization’s ability
to forecast and optimize enterprise-wide use of resources (labor, supplies,
equipment and facilities) associated with the delivery of care. These
solutions help automate and link resource requirements to care protocols
designed to increase profitability, enhance decision-making, and improve
business processes.

In addition to the product offerings described above, the segment offers a
comprehensive range of services to help organizations derive greater value
from, and enhance satisfaction and return on investment throughout the life of
the solutions implemented. The range of services includes:

Technology Services

. The segment has worked with numerous healthcare
organizations to support the smooth operation of their information systems by
providing the technical infrastructure designed to maximize application
accessibility, availability, security and performance.

Professional Services

. Professional services help customers achieve
business results from their software investment. The segment offers a wide
array of quality service options including consulting for business process
improvement and re-design, as well as implementation, project management,
technical, and education services relating to all products in the Information
Solutions segment.

Outsourcing Services

. The segment helps organizations focus their
resources where needed while the segment manages their information technology
or revenue cycle operations through outsourcing. Outsourcing service options
include managing hospital data processing operations, as well as strategic
information systems planning and



McKESSON CORPORATION

management, revenue cycle processes, payroll
processing, business office administration, and major system conversions.

Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures

We have undertaken strategic initiatives in recent years designed to
further focus on our core healthcare businesses and enhance our competitive
position. These initiatives are detailed in Financial Notes 2 and 3 to the
consolidated financial statements, “Acquisitions” and “Discontinued Operations
and Other Divestitures,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Pharmaceutical
Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments face strong competition, both
in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line, short-line
and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, and
manufacturers engaged in direct distribution. In addition, these segments face
competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and
other healthcare manufacturers (as well as other potential customers of the
segments) which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal
needs, supply management capabilities which are provided by the segments and
other competing service providers. Price, quality of service, and, in some
cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive
elements in these segments.

Our Information Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from
many firms, including other computer services firms, consulting firms, shared
service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, hardware vendors and
Internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry.
Competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical
coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.

Other Information About the Business

Customers

. In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth
has been with a limited number of large customers. During 2004, sales to our
largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, and ten largest customers accounted for
approximately 11% and 50% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2004, accounts
receivable from Rite Aid



McKESSON CORPORATION

Corporation and our ten largest customers were
approximately 8% and 50% of total accounts receivable. The majority of these
revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment.

Research and Development.

Our research and development (“R&D”)
expenditures primarily consist of our investment in software development held
for sale. We expended $230.4 million, $203.2 million, and $183.7 million for
R&D activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002, and of these amounts, we capitalized
25%, 26% and 26%. R&D expenditures are incurred by our Information Solutions
segment and our Medical Management and Automation businesses. Our Information
Solutions segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and
installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of
hospitals. We believe a substantial and sustained commitment to such
expenditures is important to the long-term success of this business.
Additional information regarding our R&D activities is included in Financial
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting
Policies,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental Legislation

. We sold our chemical distribution operations
in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations.
Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may
require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These
matters are described further in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Other than any capital expenditures that may be required
in connection with those legal matters, we do not anticipate making substantial
capital expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with
environmental laws and regulations in the future. The amount of our capital
expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2004 and is not
expected to be material in the next year.

Employees

. On March 31, 2004, we employed approximately 24,600 persons
compared to 24,500 in 2003 and 24,000 in 2002.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export
Sales.

Information as to foreign operations is included in Financial Notes 1
and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting
Policies” and “Segments of Business,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Item 2. Properties

Because of the nature of our principal businesses, plant, warehousing,
office and other facilities are operated in widely dispersed locations. The
warehouses are typically owned or leased on a long-term basis. We consider our
operating properties to be in satisfactory condition and adequate to meet our
needs for the next several years without making capital expenditures materially
higher than historical levels. Information as to material lease commitments is
included in Financial Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, “Lease
Obligations,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

I. Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by the Company in April, May and July of 1999 that
it had determined that certain software sales transactions in its Information
Solutions segment, formerly HBO & Company (“HBOC”) and now known as McKesson
Information Solutions, Inc., were improperly recorded as revenue and reversed,
as of March 31, 2004, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed against McKesson,
HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors,
and other defendants, including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. (“Bear Stearns”) and
Arthur Andersen LLP (“Arthur Andersen”).

Federal Actions

Sixty-seven of the above mentioned actions have been filed in Federal
Court (the “Federal Actions”). All of the undismissed Federal Actions are
pending before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District
Court (the “Court”) for the Northern District of California. Federal Actions
filed as class actions (excluding the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(commonly known as “ERISA”) actions discussed below) have been consolidated
into a single action before Judge Whyte under the caption

In re McKesson HBOC,
Inc. Securities Litigation

(Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the “Consolidated
Action”). As discussed below, some individual Federal Actions are also pending
before Judge Whyte. By order dated December 22, 1999, Judge Whyte appointed
the New York State



McKESSON CORPORATION

Common Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff”)
in the Consolidated Action and approved Lead Plaintiff’s choice of counsel.

After the filing of three consolidated complaints and multiple motions by
multiple defendants challenging the sufficiency of those complaints, the
pleadings in the case have been set with respect to McKesson and HBOC (motions
for reconsideration of prior dismissal orders issued by Judge Whyte have been
filed by Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns and remain pending). The operative
complaint in the Consolidated Action is Lead Plaintiff’s Third Amended and
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“TAC”), filed on February 15, 2002. The
TAC asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of
the Exchange Act in connection with the
events leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May and July 1999, and
names McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns as defendants. The
Section 10(b) claim alleges that McKesson and HBOC intentionally misstated the
financial statements of HBOC or McKesson during the class period. The Section
14(a) claim alleges that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus issued in
connection with a McKesson subsidiary and HBOC merger (the “Merger”) contained
material misstatements or omissions and that McKesson was negligent in issuing
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with those misstatements. The TAC seeks
unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees.

By order dated January 6, 2003, Judge Whyte dismissed with prejudice the
claim against the Company under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act to the extent
that claim was based on McKesson’s conduct or statements prior to the January
12, 1999 merger transaction with HBOC, denied the Company’s motion to dismiss
the claim against the Company under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and
ordered the Company to answer the TAC. Following the Court’s January 6, 2003
orders, the following claims remained against McKesson and HBOC: (i) a claim
against HBOC under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act; (ii) a claim against
McKesson under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to post-Merger
conduct only; and (iii) a Section 14(a) claim against McKesson, as described in
the Court’s January 6, 2003 order. The Company and HBOC filed answers to the
TAC on March 7, 2003, denying that the Company or HBOC had violated Section
10(b) or Section 14(a) or that they had any liability to the alleged plaintiff
class.

On March 7, 2003, Lead Plaintiff filed a motion for class certification
seeking to certify a class consisting of (i) all persons and entities who
purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of HBOC during the
period from January 20, 1997, through and including January 12, 1999, (ii) all
persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded
securities or call options, or who sold put options, of McKesson during the
period from October 18, 1998 through and including April 27, 1999, and (iii)
all persons and entities who held McKesson common stock on November 27, 1998
and still held those shares on January 12, 1999. Lead Plaintiff seeks an order
appointing three representatives of this proposed class: (i) the Lead
Plaintiff; (ii) City of Miami Beach General Employees Retirement Trust; and
(iii) an individual investor named Donald Chiert. The hearing on class
certification was held on March 12, 2004. Judge Whyte has not yet ruled on the
motion for class certification. McKesson and HBOC have commenced the
production of documents in the Consolidated Action and, pursuant to pretrial
orders, merits depositions have begun. A trial is scheduled to commence on
September 12, 2005.

On January 11, 2001, McKesson filed an action in the Court for the
Northern District of California against the Lead Plaintiff in the Consolidated
Action individually, and as a representative of a defendant class of former
HBOC shareholders who exchanged HBOC shares for Company shares in the January
12, 1999 Merger,

McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State Common Retirement Fund,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. C01-20021 RMW) (the “Complaint and Counterclaim”). In
the Complaint and Counterclaim, the Company alleged that the exchanged HBOC
shares were artificially inflated due to undisclosed accounting improprieties,
and that the exchange ratio therefore provided more shares to former HBOC
shareholders than would have otherwise been the case. In this action, the
Company sought to recover the “unjust enrichment” received by those HBOC
shareholders who exchanged more than 20,000 HBOC shares in the Merger. The
Company did not allege any wrongdoing by these shareholders. On January 9,
2002, Judge Whyte dismissed the Complaint and Counterclaim with prejudice. The
Company appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”). On August 13, 2003, the Ninth Circuit
affirmed Judge Whyte’s January 9, 2002, order dismissing the Complaint and
Counterclaim.

By order dated February 7, 2000, Judge Whyte coordinated with the
Consolidated Action a class action alleging claims under ERISA,

Chang v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-00-20030 RMW), and a shareholder
derivative action that had been filed in the Northern District of
California under the caption

Cohen v. McCall et al.

(Case No. C-99-20916 RMW)
with the Consolidated Action. There has been no further significant activity
in the Cohen action. By stipulated order dated April 30, 2003, no defendant or
nominal defendant is required to respond to the complaint until notified by the
plaintiff in writing with thirty days notice or upon further order of the
Court. Recent developments in the Chang action are discussed below.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Several individual actions have also been filed in, or transferred to, the
Northern District of California. On November 12, 1999, an individual
shareholder action was filed in the Court for the Northern District of
California under the caption

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(C-99-21192
RMW). The Plaintiffs in Jacobs are former HBOC shareholders who acquired their
HBOC shares pursuant to a registration statement issued by HBOC prior to the
Merger, and then exchanged their HBOC shares for McKesson shares in the Merger.
Plaintiffs in Jacobs assert claims under federal and state securities laws and
a claim for common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages, and costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. Judge Whyte’s
December 22, 1999, order consolidated the Jacobs action with the Consolidated
Action. With leave of the Court, the Jacobs plaintiffs amended their
complaint, but the action remains stayed. On September 21, 2000 the plaintiffs
in

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

filed a new individual action entitled

Jacobs
v. HBO & Company

(Case No. C-00-20974 RMW). The Jacobs complaint names only
HBOC as a defendant and asserts claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the
Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and various state law causes
of action. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages,
and costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. This action has been assigned to
Judge Whyte and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On December 16, 1999, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Bea v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al

. (Case No. C-00-20072 RMW). Plaintiffs in Bea filed an Amended Complaint
on March 9, 2000. Plaintiffs in Bea allege that they acquired the Company’s
common stock prior to the Merger and sold that stock after the April 1999
announcement at a loss. The Bea complaint asserts claims under the federal and
state securities laws, and a claim for fraud. Plaintiffs seek (i) unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, and (ii) reasonable costs and expenses of
suit, including attorneys’ fees. Bea is currently stayed and has been
consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On January 7, 2000, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Cater v. McKesson Corporation
et al.

(Case No. C-00-20327 RMW). The plaintiff is Terry Cater, a former
employee of the Company who alleges that his options and restricted stock were
substantially devalued as a result of the Merger and the subsequent drop in the
Company’s stock price. Plaintiff in Cater asserts claims under the federal
securities laws as well as claims for breach of good faith and fair dealing,
fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Plaintiff seeks (i) unspecified special
damages in excess of $50,000, (ii) unspecified general damages, (iii)
prejudgment interest and (iv) reasonable attorneys’ fees. The case has been
assigned to Judge Whyte and the parties stipulated to a stay pending the
outcome of the motions to dismiss in the Consolidated Action.

On February 7, 2000, an action entitled

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al.

(Case No. CV 00-0188) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Louisiana. The same plaintiffs then filed a virtually identical
parallel action in Louisiana State Court, Rapides Parish, under the caption

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al

(filed as Case No. 199018; Case No.
CV-00-0522 after removal to federal court). Plaintiffs, former shareholders of
Automated Prescription Services, allege claims under the federal securities
laws, and claims for breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and
detrimental reliance. The state court action was removed to federal court and
the two Baker cases have been transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On June 17, 2003, plaintiffs in the Baker cases filed a Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”) against McKesson, HBOC, various current or former officers or
directors of McKesson or HBOC, Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns. The SAC
asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under Section 14(a) of the Exchange
Act, for common law breach of fiduciary duty (McKesson only),
misrepresentation, and detrimental reliance. The SAC seeks damages in an
unspecified amount. By stipulation of the parties and order of the Court, the
Baker action is stayed and the defendants are not currently required to respond
to the SAC.

On July 27, 2001, an action was filed in the Court for the Northern
District of California captioned

Pacha, et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(Case No. C01-20713 PVT). The Pacha plaintiffs allege that they were
individual stockholders of McKesson stock on November 27, 1998, and assert that
McKesson and HBOC violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and that
McKesson, aided by HBOC, breached its fiduciary duties to plaintiffs by issuing
a joint proxy statement in connection with the Merger which allegedly contained
false and misleading statements or omissions. Plaintiffs name as defendants
McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of
McKesson or HBOC, Bear Stearns and Arthur Andersen. The Pacha complaint
seeks an award of compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount
and costs and expenses incurred in the action including reasonable attorneys’
fees. On November 13, 2001, Judge Whyte ordered Pacha consolidated with the
Consolidated Action and stayed all further proceedings.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Hess v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, an action filed in state court in
Arizona (Case No. C-20003862) on behalf of former shareholders of Ephrata
Diamond Spring Water Company (“Ephrata”) who acquired McKesson shares in
exchange for their Ephrata stock when McKesson acquired Ephrata in January
1999, was removed to federal court, transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action. Judge Whyte also
stayed all further proceedings in Hess except for the filing of an amended
complaint, which was filed on or about December 15, 2001 (the “Hess Amended
Complaint”). The Hess Amended Complaint generally incorporates the allegations
and claims asserted in the Consolidated Action and also includes various common
law causes of action relating to McKesson’s acquisition of Ephrata. The Hess
Amended Complaint seeks compensatory, punitive, general and special damages in
an unspecified amount, rescission of the agreement with Ephrata, attorneys’
fees and costs. The Company is not currently required to respond to the Hess
Amended Complaint.

On June 28, 2001, the Chang plaintiffs filed an amended ERISA class action
complaint against McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or
directors of McKesson or HBOC, and The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”). The
amended complaint in Chang generally alleged that the defendants breached their
ERISA fiduciary duties in connection with administering the McKesson HBOC
Profit Sharing Investment Plan (the “PSI Plan”) and the HBOC Profit Sharing and
Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”). Plaintiffs in Chang are former employees of
McKesson and participants in the PSI Plan, and purportedly seek relief under
sections 404-405, 409 and 502 of ERISA on behalf of a class defined to include
participants in the PSI Plan, including participants under the HBOC Plan, who
maintained an account balance under the PSI Plan as of April 27, 1999, who had
not received a distribution from the PSI Plan as of April 27, 1999, and who
suffered losses as a result of the alleged breaches of duty.

On February 7, 2002, a related ERISA class action was filed in the Court
for the Northern District of California captioned

Adams v. McKesson Information
Solutions, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-02-06 85 JCS). Plaintiff in Adams filed a
first amended complaint on March 15, 2002, against HBOC, McKesson, the HBO &
Company Board of Directors, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Administrative Committee, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Investment Committee, McKesson HBOC, Inc. Profit Sharing Investment Plan (as a
nominal defendant only), and certain current or former officers, directors or
employees of McKesson or HBOC. Plaintiff alleges that he was a participant in
the HBOC Plan and generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC breached their ERISA
fiduciary duties to the HBOC Plan and its participants or engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiff asserts his claims on behalf of a
putative class defined to include all participants in the HBOC Plan and their
beneficiaries for whose benefit the HBOC Plan acquired HBOC stock from March
31, 1996 to April 1, 1999. Plaintiff seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and
HBOC breached their fiduciary duties, (ii) an order requiring defendants to
restore to the plan all losses caused by these purported breaches of fiduciary
duty, and (iii) reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses.

On June 3, 2002, Judge Whyte consolidated the Adams ERISA class action
with the Chang ERISA class action. By order dated September 30, 2002 Judge
Whyte dismissed the First Amended Complaint in the Chang action. Judge Whyte
granted plaintiffs in Chang and Adams leave to file a consolidated and amended
complaint under the caption

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. ERISA Litigation

(Northern District of California No. C-02-0685 RMW) (the “ERISA Action”). On
December 31, 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint (the
“CAC”) in the ERISA Action. The CAC generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC
breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA, and that HBOC engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiffs further allege that McKesson and
HBOC are liable under principles of

respondeat superior

and agency for alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties by other defendants. The CAC seeks to have the
defendants restore to the HBOC Plan and McKesson Plan losses allegedly caused
by their alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees,
costs and expenses. On February 28, 2003, McKesson filed a motion to dismiss
the CAC and HBOC filed motions to dismiss portions of the CAC. Judge Whyte has
not yet issued a ruling on these motions.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have also been filed in various state courts in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State
Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State Actions generally allege
misconduct by McKesson or HBOC (and others) in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements.

Two of the State Actions are shareholder derivative actions:

Ash, et al.
v. McCall, et al.

, (Case No. 17132), filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and

Mitchell v. McCall et al.

(Case. No. 304415), filed in California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco. McKesson is named as a nominal
defendant only as no relief is sought against it in these actions. Plaintiffs
in Mitchell agreed to defer any action by the court on McKesson’s motions



McKESSON CORPORATION

pending resolution of McKesson’s dismissal motion in Ash. On September 15,
2000, in the Ash case, the Court of Chancery dismissed all causes of action
with leave to re-plead certain of the dismissed claims, and on January 22,
2001, the Ash plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint. On October 30, 2003,
the Court granted the plaintiffs leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint and
changed the caption of the case to

Saito, et. al. v. McCall

(Civil Action No.
17132). On December 15, 2003, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the
Fourth Amended Complaint. A hearing has been scheduled for May 18, 2004, to
consider the defendants’ motions to dismiss.

Five of the State Actions are class actions. Three of these were filed in
the Delaware Court of Chancery:

Derdiger v. Tallman et al.

(Civil Action No.
17276),

Carroll v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 17454) and

Kelly v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Civil Action No. 17282). Two additional actions
were filed in the Delaware Superior Court:

Edmondson v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 99-951) and

Caravetta v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action
No. 00C-04-214 WTQ). The Carroll and Kelly actions have been voluntarily
dismissed without prejudice. McKesson removed Edmondson to federal court in
Delaware and filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the federal court
on March 5, 2002. McKesson filed motions to stay the Derdiger and Caravetta
actions in favor of proceedings in the federal Consolidated Action, which were
granted. On December 20, 2001, the plaintiff in Derdiger moved to vacate the
stay of that action. In a series of rulings dated September 9, 2002, October
11, 2002 and October 18, 2002, the court denied plaintiff’s motion to vacate
the stay with respect to any class claims but granted plaintiff leave to
proceed with his individual claims. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion
for partial summary judgment, and the former directors of Access Health, Inc.,
who are also defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the claims asserted against
them. The parties have asked the court to defer consideration of those motions
while they pursue settlement discussions. On August 4, 2003, the court issued
an order dismissing the class action claims brought on behalf of persons other
than the named plaintiff Howard Derdiger without prejudice in favor of the
prior pending Consolidated Action pending in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California. The parties thereafter dismissed plaintiff
Howard Derdiger’s individual claims with prejudice pursuant to a settlement.

Several of the State Actions are individual actions which have been filed
in various state courts. Five of these were filed in the California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco:

Yurick v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 303857),

The State of Oregon by and through the Oregon Public
Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 307619),

Utah State Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 311269),

Minnesota State Board of Investment v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
311747), and

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. CGC-02-405792). Oregon, Utah, and Minnesota and Merrill
Lynch have been consolidated before the Honorable Donald S. Mitchell under the
Oregon caption.

In Yurick, the trial court sustained McKesson’s demurrer to the original
complaint without leave to amend with respect to all causes of action except
plaintiffs’ claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation, which
remain in the case. The complaint in Yurick seeks compensatory, general,
special, punitive and consequential damages in an unspecified amount,
prejudgment interest, costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. On December 27,
2002, the Yurick action was assigned to Judge Mitchell, the presiding judge in
the Oregon, Minnesota, Utah and Merrill Lynch actions.

The Oregon, Utah and Minnesota actions referenced above are individual
securities actions filed in the California Superior Court for the City and
County of San Francisco by the out-of-state pension funds for each of those
States and Colorado. On October 16, 2002, after motion practice to challenge
the sufficiency of the complaints in Utah, Minnesota and Oregon, which resulted
in the dismissal of a number of claims that had been asserted against McKesson
and HBOC, and the consolidation of those actions under the caption

The State of
Oregon Public Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Master
File No. 307619), plaintiffs in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah filed a consolidated
and amended complaint (the “CAAC”) which consolidated the remaining claims in
those actions. On October 11, 2002, plaintiffs in Merrill Lynch filed an
amended complaint in the Merrill Lynch action.

On March 13, 2003, Judge Mitchell overruled McKesson’s and HBOC’s
demurrers to and motions to strike the CAAC in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah. On
the same date, Judge Mitchell sustained in part and overruled in part
McKesson’s and HBOC’s demurrers, and denied McKesson’s and HBOC’s motions to
strike the amended complaint in Merrill Lynch. Following those orders, the
following claims remain against McKesson and HBOC in the
consolidated Oregon action: (i) under California law, for violation of
California Corporations Code § 25000/25400, for violation of California
Business and Professions Code § 17200 (against HBOC only), and for common law
fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and (ii) under Georgia law, claims for
conspiracy under Georgia’s RICO statute, and for common law fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The CAAC seeks



McKESSON CORPORATION

compensatory, general, punitive and special damages, pre-judgment interest,
post-judgment interest and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Following the Court’s
March 13, 2003, orders and the Court’s June 18, 2003, order granting the
plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, the following claims remain against
McKesson and HBOC in the Merrill Lynch action: (i) under California law, for
violation of California Corporations Code § 25000/25400, for violation of
California Business and Professions Code § 17200 (against HBOC only), and for
common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy and aiding and
abetting, (ii) under New Jersey law, for violation of New Jersey’s RICO statute
and conspiracy to violate New Jersey’s RICO statute, and (iii) under Georgia
law, for violation of Georgia’s securities laws and violation of Georgia’s RICO
statutes.

On June 27, 2003, plaintiffs in the Merrill Lynch action filed a Third
Amended Complaint (the “TAAC”) against McKesson, HBOC, various current or
former officers or directors of McKesson or HBOC, and Arthur Andersen. Like
the prior complaints in the Merrill Lynch action, the TAAC generally alleges
that the defendants are liable under various statutory and common law claims in
connection with the events leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May
and July of 1999. The TAAC asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under
California Corporations Code § 25400(d)/25500, California Business and
Profession Code § 17200 (HBOC only), common law fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, conspiracy and aiding and abetting, New Jersey RICO
(McKesson only), conspiracy to violate New Jersey RICO, Georgia’s securities
laws, and conspiracy to violate Georgia RICO. The TAAC seeks an award of
restitution, compensatory damages and treble damages in an unspecified amount,
and costs and expenses of litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees.

On July 25, 2003, McKesson and HBOC answered the Consolidated Complaint in
Oregon, Minnesota and Utah, generally denying the allegations and any liability
to plaintiffs. Also on July 25, 2003, McKesson filed cross-claims against all
plaintiffs named in the Consolidated Complaint, alleging that if such parties
exchanged HBOC shares in the Merger that were artificially inflated, as alleged
by those parties in the Consolidated Complaint, then the exchange ratio for the
Merger provided more shares to plaintiffs than would have otherwise been the
case, and more shares than was just. The Company’s cross-claims against the
plaintiffs seek judgments requiring plaintiffs to disgorge to the Company any
“unjust enrichment.” On January 9, 2004, the court heard arguments on
plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss McKesson’s cross-claims. The court has not yet
issued a ruling on that motion.

On September 26, 2003 the Merrill Lynch Plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended
Complaint (the “FAC”). The FAC adds Bear Stearns, General Electric Capital
Corporation, Inc. (“GECC”), Computer Associates International, Inc. (“CAI”),
and WebMD Corp. (“WebMD”) as defendants. The claims against GECC allege that
GECC aided and abetted the alleged fraud at HBOC, conspired to commit fraud and
made negligent misrepresentations. On December 30, 2003, McKesson and HBOC
answered the FAC, generally denying the allegations and any liability to
plaintiffs. Judge Mitchell has scheduled a trial date of November 28, 2005, in
the consolidated Oregon, Minnesota, Utah and Merrill Lynch actions.

Several individual actions have been filed in various state courts outside
of California. Several of these cases have been filed in Georgia state courts.
On October 24, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Suffolk Partners Limited Partnership et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 00VS010469A). Plaintiffs in the Suffolk action allegedly
purchased the Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999
announcement. Plaintiffs assert claims under Georgia’s securities and
racketeering laws, and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The Suffolk action names as defendants
the Company, HBOC, and certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, and Arthur Andersen. Like the Consolidated Action, the
claims in the Suffolk action generally arise out of the January 12, 1999
Merger, and the Company’s announcement of the need to restate its financial
statements. Plaintiffs seek (i) compensatory damages of approximately $22
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Company and HBOC separately answered the complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Suffolk
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. On August 2,
2001, the Court granted the motions to stay. Subsequently, however, in May
2003, the Court lifted the stay and directed the parties to coordinate
discovery with that in the Consolidated Action and several other actions.
Following the lifting of the stay, all Defendants filed motions to dismiss on
various grounds, all of which were denied, except as to Defendant Pulido, whom
Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed. Discovery is now proceeding in coordination
with the Consolidated Action.

On November 1, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
00 VS 010801). Plaintiff in the Curran action allegedly purchased the
Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999 announcement.
The claims in the Curran action are identical to the claims in the Suffolk
action. Plaintiff seeks (i) compensatory damages of approximately



McKESSON CORPORATION

$3 million,
as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with respect
to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Curran action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, and
certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and
Arthur Andersen. The Company and HBOC separately answered the Complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Curran
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. The Court
granted the motions to stay on August 22, 2001. However, in September 2003,
the court lifted the stay and transferred the action to the judge presiding
over the previously-reported action captioned

Suffolk Partners L.P. et al v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

, (Georgia State Court, Fulton County No.
00VS010469A). Discovery is now proceeding in coordination with the
Consolidated Action.

On December 12, 2001, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Drake v. McKesson Corp., et al.

(Case No. 01VS026303A).
Plaintiff in Drake is a former HBOC employee seeking lost commissions as well
as asserting claims under Georgia’s securities and racketeering laws, and
various common law causes of action. Plaintiff seeks (i) approximately
$300,000 in unpaid commissions, (ii) unspecified compensatory, consequential,
actual, exemplary, and punitive damages, and (iii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
The Drake action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and
Jay Gilbertson. The parties entered into a Consent Order for Partial Stay on
February 27, 2002, which stayed Plaintiff’s Georgia securities law, fraud and
RICO claims. On March 4, 2002, McKesson and McKesson Information Solutions
Inc. separately filed their answers. Following discovery, the case was settled
and Plaintiff filed a dismissal with prejudice on March 5, 2004.

Two similar Georgia actions have been consolidated for purposes of
discovery and may be consolidated for purposes of trial. On January 31, 2002,
an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton County, under the caption

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v. McKesson, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
2002-CV-48407). Plaintiffs in the Green action are former HBOC shareholders.
Plaintiff Holcombe Green was also a former officer, chairman and director of
HBOC. On February 6, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court,
Fulton County, under the caption

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 2002-CV-48612). Plaintiff in the Hall action is a former
HBOC shareholder. One of the limited partners of the Hall Plaintiff is Nancy
Hall Green, the wife of Holcombe Green. The complaints in the Green and Hall
actions are substantially identical. In each action, Plaintiffs asserted
claims for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance and named as defendants
the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. In each action,
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $100 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’ fees. The Company and HBOC filed their respective answers and
counterclaims on April 22, 2002. HBOC also filed a third party complaint
against Holcombe Green for indemnification. The Company and HBOC also filed
motions to stay and dismiss. The Court denied the motions to stay, and
partially granted the motions to dismiss, dismissing Plaintiffs’ claims for
fraudulent conveyance. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaims filed by
the Company and HBOC, and the Court denied those motions. Discovery is under
way and will proceed for some time. The trial court granted Plaintiffs’ motion
to compel the production of certain work product materials, and the Georgia
Court of Appeals affirmed. The Company has filed a petition for discretionary
review in the Georgia Supreme Court, and Plaintiffs have filed an opposition to
that petition.

On May 8, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton County,
under the caption

James Gilbert v. McKesson Corporation, et al.

(Case No.
02VS032502C). Plaintiff, formerly the general counsel of HBOC, alleges he was
a holder of options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock. The action
names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson.
Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages of approximately $2 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’ fees. On June 24, 2002, the Company and HBOC filed their respective
answers, motions to stay, and motions to dismiss. On November 26, 2002, the
court granted the motions to stay, and this case is stayed until final
disposition of the Consolidated Action.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of
California (“USAO”) and the SEC are conducting investigations into the matters
leading to the restatement. On May 15, 2000, the USAO filed a one-count
information against former HBOC officer, Dominick DeRosa, charging Mr. DeRosa
with aiding and abetting securities fraud, and on May 15, 2000, Mr. DeRosa
entered a guilty plea to that charge. On September 28, 2000, an indictment was
unsealed in the Northern District of California against former HBOC officer,
Jay P. Gilbertson, and
former Company and HBOC officer, Albert J. Bergonzi,

United States v.
Bergonzi, et al.

(Case No. CR-00-0505). On that same date, a civil complaint
was filed by the SEC against Mr. Gilbertson, Mr. Bergonzi and Mr. DeRosa

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gilbertson, et al.

(Case No. C-00-3570).
Mr. DeRosa has settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the
substantive allegations of the complaint. On January 10, 2001, the grand jury



McKESSON CORPORATION

returned a superseding indictment in the Northern District of California
against Messrs. Gilbertson and Bergonzi,

United States v. Bergonzi, et al.

(Case No. CR-00-0505), and on June 4, 2003, a second superseding indictment was
unsealed which added new charges against Mr. Bergonzi and which also charged
both former Chairman of the Board of HBOC and the Company, Charles W. McCall,
and former HBOC General Counsel, Jay Lapine, with various securities law
violations. Also on June 4, 2003, the USAO announced the filing of agreements
with Messrs. Gilbertson, DeRosa and former HBOC Senior Vice President for
Finance, Timothy Heyerdahl, to plead guilty to various securities law
violations (Case Nos. CR-00-0505, CR-00-0213 and CR-01-0002, respectively).
The USAO has informed the Company that it is not now nor has it ever been a
subject or target of the USAO’s investigation.

On September 27, 2001, the SEC filed securities fraud charges against six
former HBOC officers and employees including Messrs. Heyerdahl and Lapine.
Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission’s civil complaints, four of the
six defendants settled the claims brought against them by, among other things,
consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaints, to
entry of permanent injunctions against all of the alleged violations, and
agreed to pay civil penalties in various amounts. On June 4, 2003, the SEC
filed a civil complaint against Mr. McCall for various securities law
violations (Case No. C-03-2603). On January 3, 2002, the Company was notified
in writing by the SEC that its investigation has been terminated as to the
Company, and that no enforcement action has been recommended to the Commission.

On April 24, 2003, Gilbertson entered into a written plea agreement with
the USAO in which he pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and
making false statements in a document filed with the SEC. On October 16, 2003,
Bergonzi entered into a written plea agreement with the USAO in which he pled
guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. On March
30, 2004, the USAO filed a three count indictment against former McKesson
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Richard H. Hawkins,
charging him with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, securities
fraud, and making false statements to an accountant. On March 31, 2004, Mr.
Hawkins pled not guilty to the charges.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings, or to estimate the amounts
of, or potential range of, loss with respect to those proceedings. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain.
The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments
against the Company or settlements that could require substantial payments by
the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigation and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for product liability and other damages, investigations relating to
governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal
conduct of our business. These include:

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., is one of many defendants
in approximately 24 cases in which plaintiffs claim they were injured due to
exposure, over many years, to latex proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous
manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors, including McKesson
Medical-Surgical Inc. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its suppliers
are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers.
McKesson Medical Surgical Inc.’s insurers are providing some coverage for
these cases, subject to applicable deductibles.

We, along with more than 100 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit
brought in 2000 by the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (the
“Foundation”) alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven (7)
U.S. patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for
the automated management and control of product inventory, warehousing,
distribution and point-of-sale transactions. Due to the pendency of earlier
litigation brought against the Foundation by the manufacturers of bar code
devices attacking the validity of the patents at issue, the court stayed the
suit against us until the conclusion of the earlier case, including any appeals
that may be taken. The trial in this earlier case concluded in January 2003
and the court subsequently ruled that
each of the patents at issue was invalid due to prosecutorial laches. An
appeal by the Foundation to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is
anticipated. While the suit against the Company was stayed, the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office granted petitions for reexamination of three of the seven
patents asserted by the Foundation against the Company. The reexamination will
determine, among other things, whether these patents have expired.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Each of the
remaining four patents in the action has already expired by its own terms, or
by the Foundation disclaiming the remaining portion of the patent’s life.

We, through our former McKesson Chemical Company division, are named in
approximately 66 cases involving the alleged distribution of asbestos. These
cases typically involve multiple plaintiffs claiming personal injuries and
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement signed
at the time of the 1986 sale of McKesson Chemical Company to what is now called
Univar USA Inc. (“Univar”), we have tendered each of these actions to Univar.
Univar is currently defending us but has raised questions concerning the extent
of its obligations under the indemnification agreement. Discussions with
Univar on that subject are ongoing. We have not paid or incurred any costs or
expenses in connection with these actions to date; and we continue to look to
Univar for defense and full indemnification of these claims. In addition, we
believe that, if necessary, a portion of these claims would be covered by
insurance.

On January 21, 2004, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation
(“AmerisourceBergen”) filed a bid protest and a request for injunctive relief,

AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation vs. U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs

(Action No. 04-00063), in the United States Court of Federal Claims in
connection with the December 31, 2003 award by the United States Department of
Veteran Affairs (the “VA”) of Prime Vendor status to the Company for the supply
of pharmaceutical products to the VA commencing April 1, 2004. We successfully
moved to intervene in this action. On February 9, 2004, the parties stipulated
and the Court ordered a delay in the commencement date of the VA contract to a
date 45 days following the Court’s decision on the merits of the
AmerisourceBergen protest. On March 31, 2004, the Court issued its decision
rejecting AmerisourceBergen’s bid protest and ordering the dismissal of the
complaint. Pursuant to the terms of the Court’s February

th

order, the
Company’s performance under the Prime Vendor contract commenced on May 10,
2004.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois (“USAOI”)
is conducting an industry-wide civil and criminal investigation into the
marketing, sale and Medicare reimbursement of enteral nutritional products
(“Products”). The Products are sold by the extended care business conducted by
our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Minnesota Inc. (“Minnesota Supply”).
The USAOI has indicated that the Company and two employees of Minnesota Supply
are subjects of the investigation. In July of 2003, the USAOI announced
indictments of the two employees on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy, and
violation of the anti-kickback statute. The employees were subsequently placed
on leave pending resolution of the charges. We continue to cooperate with the
investigation.

On May 4, 2004, a judgment was entered against the Company in

Charlene
Roby vs. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al, (

Action No. CV01-573), pending in the
Superior Court of Yolo County, California on claims by a former employee for
wrongful termination, disability discrimination and harassment and against a
Company employee defendant on the harassment claim only. The jury awarded
plaintiff $3.5 million in compensatory damages against the Company and $0.5
million in compensatory damages against the individual employee. Punitive
damages of $15.0 million were assessed against the Company. The Company will
seek reduction or reversal of this judgment through post-trial motions, and
through an appeal, if necessary. If these efforts are not successful, this
judgment could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses,
which were fully divested by 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant
to environmental laws and regulations. We have received claims and demands
from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action
purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at
six sites where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations;
and we, by administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain
actions at those sites, including soil and groundwater remediation. In
addition, we were recently one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United
States Environmental Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural
resources damages (“NRD”) associated with one of these six sites. Although the
Company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at
this time, we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) group in the funding of an NRD assessment, the costs of which are
reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with
outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of
reasonably possible remediation costs for these six sites is $12.9 million, net
of approximately $2 million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement
or we expect, based either on



McKESSON CORPORATION

agreements or nonrefundable contributions which
are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties. The $12.9 million is expected
to be paid out between April 2004 and March of 2028. Our liability for these
environmental matters has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a PRP under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the
“Superfund” law or its state law equivalent) for environmental assessment and
cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of hazardous substances at
26 sites. With respect to each of these sites, numerous other PRPs have
similarly been designated and, while the current state of the law potentially
imposes joint and several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter costs of
these sites are typically shared with other PRPs. Our estimated liability at
those 26 sites is approximately $2 million. The aggregate settlements and
costs paid by us in Superfund matters to date have not been significant. The
accompanying consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain
due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup
costs; the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs
are recoverable from insurance or other parties.

While it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome
of any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this
section II, “Other Litigation and Claims”, we believe based on current
knowledge and the advice of our counsel that, except as otherwise noted, such
litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

III. Contingency

In 2002, we entered into a $500 million, ten year contract with the
National Health Services Information Authority (“NHS”), an organization of the
British government charged with the responsibility of delivering healthcare in
England and Wales. The contract engages the Company to develop, implement and
operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 NHS locations.

To date, there have been delays to this contract which have caused
increased costs and a decrease in the amount of time in which we can earn
revenues. These delays have adversely impacted the contract’s projected
profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this contract.
As of March 31, 2004, our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of
approximately $76 million in net assets, consisting of prepaid expenses,
software and capital assets, net of cash received, related to this contract.
While we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate an acceptable
system and recover our investment in this contract, we are currently
negotiating with the NHS to amend certain key terms and conditions in the
contract, and there is no certainty we will agree on an updated implementation
plan. We expect this negotiation to be completed in the second half of
calendar year 2004. However, the timing and the outcome of these negotiations
is uncertain and failure to reach agreement on an updated implementation plan
and amend certain key contract terms and conditions, and/or further delays in
the implementation may result in losses that could be material. Even if we
agree on amended contract terms and conditions and an updated implementation
plan, it is possible that the terms of that agreement may result in the
impairment of our net assets related to the contract as well as substantial
penalties and charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the three months ended March 31,
2004.

(4)

As a result of acquisitions, the Company currently has 18 assumed option
plans under which options are exercisable for 4,244,903 shares of Company
common stock. No further awards will be made under any of the assumed
plans and information regarding the assumed options is not included in the
table above.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by
the Company’s stockholders. The plans are administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, except for the Directors’ Plan (defined
below) which is administered by the Committee on Directors and Corporate
Governance.

1994 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “1994 Plan”)

: The 1994
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in 1994 and provides for the grant
of approximately 41.2 million shares, which includes awards granted under
predecessor plans, in the form of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock
options with or without tandem stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted
stock, or restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Options granted under the 1994 Plan
are generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those granted under
the 1999 Plan, discussed below, except that under the 1994 Plan only executive
officers of the Company are eligible to receive option grants. The 1994 Plan
expires in October 2004.

1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan (the
“Directors’ Plan”)

: The Directors’ Plan was adopted in 1997 and provides for
the grant of approximately 1.3 million shares in the form of nonqualified stock
options or RSUs to non-employee directors of the Company.
Shares subject to option grants which cease to be exercisable shall not be
counted against the number of shares available under the Directors’ Plan.
RSUs (described below), whether or not distributed in the
form of restricted stock, will be counted against the number of shares
available.

Under the Director’s Plan, each director receives an annual stock option
grant of 7,500 RSUs. In addition, each director is required to defer 50% of
his or her annual retainer into either RSUs payable in cash or stock at the
Director’s election, or nonqualified stock options, and may also elect to defer
the remaining 50% of the annual retainer into RSUs or Retainer Options or the
Company’s deferred compensation administration plan (DCAP II), or may elect to
receive cash. Meeting fees and Committee Chair annual retainers may be
deferred into RSUs or DCAP II or may be paid in cash. Options are granted at
fair market value and have a term of ten years.

1973 Stock Purchase Plan (the “SPP”):

The SPP was adopted by the
stockholders of the Company’s predecessor in 1973. The Company’s stockholders
approved an additional 2.5 million shares to be issued under the SPP in 1999,
which remain available for issuance. Rights to purchase shares are granted
under the SPP to key employees of the Company as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board. The purchase price, to be paid in cash or using
promissory notes of the Company common stock subject to rights granted under
the SPP, is the fair market value of such stock on the date the right is
exercised.

2000 ESPP:

The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase
plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. In March
2002, the Board amended the ESPP to allow for participation



McKESSON CORPORATION

in the plan by employees of certain of the Company’s international and
other subsidiaries. As to those employees, the ESPP does not so qualify.
Currently, 11.1 million shares have been authorized for issuance under the
ESPP.

The ESPP is implemented through a continuous series of 24-month offerings
beginning on the first trading day on or after each May 1 and November 1 (the
“Offering Dates”) and ending on the last trading day of the month which is 24
months later (the “Offering Periods”) and six-month periods beginning on each
May 1 and November 1 and ending on the following October 31 and April 30,
during which contributions may be made toward the purchase of common stock
under the plan (“Purchase Periods”).

Each eligible employee may elect to authorize regular payroll deductions
during the next succeeding Purchase Period, the amount of which may not exceed
15% of a participant’s compensation. At the end of each Purchase Period, the
funds withheld by each participant will be used to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock. The purchase price of each share of the Company’s
common stock will be the lesser of (i) 85% of the fair market value of such
share on the first day of the Offering Period; or (ii) 85% of the fair market
value of such share on the last day of the applicable Purchase Period. In
general, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by
a participant for each Purchase Period is determined by dividing $12,500 by the
fair market value of one share of common stock on the Offering Date.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have not been
submitted for approval by the Company’s stockholders:

1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “Plan

”): The Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors in 1999. The Plan provides for the grant to
eligible employees of 45.2 million shares in the form of nonqualified stock
options, with or without SARs, restricted stock or restricted stock units. No
executive officers or directors participate in this Plan.

Options are granted at not less than fair market value and have a term of
ten years. Options generally become exercisable in four equal annual
installments beginning one year after the grant date, or after four years from
the date of grant. Restricted stock granted under the Plan contains certain
restrictions on transferability and may not be transferred until such
restrictions lapse (generally two to four years). Grantees may elect to use
stock to satisfy any withholding tax obligation upon the lapsing of
restrictions on restricted stock awards.

1998 Canadian Stock Incentive Plan (the “Canadian Plan”):

The Canadian
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in January 1998, following the
Company’s acquisition of a Canadian company, to provide nonqualified stock
options, with or without tandem SARs, to eligible employees of the Canadian
company. The Canadian Plan has subsequently been amended to allow for the
grant of stock options to employees of any of the Company’s Canadian
subsidiaries. A total of 0.9 million shares have been authorized for issuance
under the Canadian Plan. Options granted under the Canadian Plan are generally
subject to the same terms and conditions as those granted under the 1999 Plan,
discussed above, except that (i) options may be granted for less than the fair
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and (ii) all
options will become immediately exercisable upon an employee’s disability or
death and must be exercised within three years of such date.

Stock Option Plans Adopted in January 1999 and August 1999

: On January 27,
1999 and August 25, 1999 the Board of Directors adopted certain stock option
plans (the “January 1999 Plan” and the “August 1999 Plan”, or together the
“Plans”) to provide stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common
stock to eligible employees of the Company pursuant to NYSE rules in effect at
the time the Plans were established. A maximum of 5.8 million and 5.2 million
shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the January 1999 and
August 1999 Plans. In each case the Plans state that: (i) under each of the
Plans no single officer or director of the Company or any subsidiary could
acquire more than 1% of the Company’s common stock outstanding at the time the
Plans were adopted, and (ii) each of the Plans, together with all stock option
or purchase plans, or any other arrangements pursuant to which officers or
directors of the Company may acquire common stock (other than stock plans for
which stockholder approval is not required under Section 312.03 of the NYSE
Rules), does not authorize the issuance of more than 5% of the Company’s common
stock outstanding at the time the Plans were adopted (collectively the “NYSE
Limits”). Options were granted under each of the Plans to eligible employees
of the Company. No further grants will be made from either of the Plans.

Options granted under these plans are generally subject to the same terms
and conditions as those granted under the 1994 and 1999 Plans.



McKESSON CORPORATION

1999 Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999 SPP”):

The 1999 SPP was
adopted by the Board of Directors in February 1999. The 1999 SPP provided for
the grant of rights to purchase a maximum of 0.7 million shares of common stock
subject to the NYSE Limits. No further grants will be made from the 1999 SPP.
Rights to purchase shares were granted under the 1999 SPP to eligible employees
of the Company. The purchase price, to be paid in cash or using promissory
notes, for the Company common stock subject to rights granted under the 1999
SPP was equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the
date the right was exercised (which was the closing price of the Company’s
common stock on the NYSE). Purchases were evidenced by written stock purchase
agreements which provide for the payment of the purchase price by (i) payment
in cash, or (ii) a promissory note payable on a repayment schedule determined
by the Compensation Committee of the Board, or (iii) a combination of (i) and
(ii).

HBOC 1994 UK Sharesave Scheme (the “1994 Scheme”):

In connection with the
acquisition by the Company of HBO & Company (“HBOC”), we assumed the HBOC 1994
Scheme which is similar to the ESPP, under which 227,268 shares remain
available for issuance. Employees and previous directors of HBOC and its
subsidiaries, who are residents of the United Kingdom, are eligible to receive
options under the 1994 Scheme. The exercise price of the stock covered by each
option shall not be less than 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock on the date the option is granted. Participants under the 1994
Scheme pay for options through monthly contributions, subject to minimum and
maximum monthly limits.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition

GENERAL

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and
financial condition, referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist
the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and
trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the
Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
financial notes. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March
31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular
year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

We conduct our business through three operating segments: Pharmaceutical
Solutions, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Information Solutions. See Financial
Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, “Significant
Accounting Policies,” for a description of these segments. In addition, in
order to respond to changes in our business environment, in April 2004 the
Company reorganized certain businesses within these operating segments. Our
Financial Review is prepared based on operating segments in effect at March 31,
2004. Supplemental financial information regarding our operating segments
under our new organizational structure is included under the caption “2005
Operating Segments” included in this Financial Review.

Revenues increased 22% to $69.5 billion in 2004 and 14% to $57.1 billion
in 2003 primarily reflecting revenue growth in our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment which is attributable to market growth rates as well as new customers
and/or expanded business with existing customers.

Gross profit increased 5% to $3.2 billion and 11% to $3.1 billion in 2004
and 2003. As a percentage of revenues, gross margins declined 76 and 15 basis
points in 2004 and 2003. Declines in our gross profit margins primarily
reflect a higher proportion of our revenue being attributable to our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which has lower margins relative to our other
segments and a decline in the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment’s margin in
2004. This segment’s gross profit margin was impacted by declines in the sell
margin due to the competitive environment in which we operate as well as
pressure on its buy side margin and by a higher proportion of sales to
customers’ warehouses which have lower margins. In addition, gross profit in
2004 and 2003 was impacted by a number of significant items, which are
discussed in further detail, including a $51.0 million provision for expected
losses on five multi-year contracts in our Information Solutions segment’s
international business in 2003.

Operating expenses increased 4% to $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion in 2004
and 2003. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased 54 and 38
basis points in 2004 and 2003. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues
have declined over the last two years, mainly due to leveraging of our fixed
cost infrastructure and productivity improvements in back-office and field
operations as well as a higher proportion of sales to customers’ warehouses
which have lower operating expense margins. Increases in operating expense
dollars were primarily due to additional expenses incurred to support our sales
volume growth. Operating expenses were also impacted by a number of
significant items which are discussed in further detail, including a $66.4
million credit pertaining to the reversal of a portion of customer settlement
reserves within our Information Solutions segment in 2004 and $39.8 million in
restructuring charges primarily related to a restructuring plan initiated for
our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment and restructuring activities in our
Information Solutions segment in 2002.

Income before income taxes increased 7% to $911.4 million and 41% to
$851.4 million in 2004 and 2003, reflecting the above noted factors. On an
operating segment basis, results for 2004 primarily reflect revenue growth



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

and competitive pricing pressure in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment,
and improved operating profit in our Medical-Surgical Solutions and Information
Solutions segments. Results for 2003 reflect revenue growth and operating
margin expansion in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and improved operating
profit in our Information Solutions segment.

Net income increased 16% to $646.5 million in 2004 and 33% to $555.4
million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $2.19 in 2004 and
31% to $1.88 in 2003. In addition to those factors discussed above, net income
reflected a reduction in our effective income tax rates, as well as a $23.2
million tax benefit relating to favorable tax settlements and adjustments in
2004 and a $36.1 million tax benefit in 2002 relating to the sale of a
business.

Revenues increased 22% in 2004 and 14% in 2003. The growth in revenues
was primarily driven by the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which accounted
for more than 90% of revenues. Revenues were not materially impacted by
business acquisitions.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Increases in U.S. Healthcare pharmaceutical distribution and services
revenues for 2004, excluding sales to customers’ warehouses, primarily reflect
market growth rates as well as new independent pharmacy, mail order and
institutional customers in our pharmaceutical distribution business. Increases
in these revenues for 2003 also reflect market growth rates as well as new
retail and institutional customers in our pharmaceutical distribution business,
new business that was previously direct or outside the distribution channel and
growth in our automation, specialty pharmaceutical products, and pharmacy
outsourcing services businesses. Market growth rates reflect growing drug
utilization and price increases, which are offset in part by the increased use
of lower priced generics.

U.S. Healthcare sales to customers’ warehouses increased primarily as a
result of several expanded agreements with existing customers in 2004, and also
growth from existing customers in 2004 and 2003. Sales to customers’
warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a
limited number of large self-warehousing customers whereby we order and
subsequently deliver bulk products from the manufacturer to the customers’
warehouses through a central distribution facility. These sales provide a
benefit to our customers in that they can use one source for both their direct
store-to-store business and their warehouse business.

Canadian pharmaceutical distribution revenues increased in 2004 reflecting
market growth rates, new business from manufacturers who formerly engaged in
direct distribution activities and favorable foreign exchange rates. On a
constant currency basis, revenues from our Canadian operations would have
increased approximately 14% compared to 2003. Revenues for 2003 also increased
reflecting market growth rates, greater sales to existing customers, increased
sales of product that previously went direct from manufacturers, and to a
lesser extent, favorable foreign exchange rates.

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distribution revenues decreased
nominally in 2004 and increased nominally in 2003. Increases in our primary
and extended care sectors were either fully offset or almost fully offset by a
decline in revenues in the acute care sector. The segment’s decline in its
acute care business reflects the competitive environment in which it operates
and the transition of the loss of the segment’s largest customer.

Information Solutions segment revenues increased in 2004 primarily from
services and hardware revenues. Revenues for 2004 reflect decreases in sales
of non-clinical solutions and longer installation periods required for certain
large complex clinical implementations, which have the effect of delaying
revenue recognition. Revenues for 2003 increased reflecting the sale of new
clinical products including those from Horizon Medical Imaging

TM

, which was the
result of our July 2002 purchase of A.L.I. Technologies Inc. (“A.L.I.”).

higher proportion of revenues attributable to our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment, which has lower margins relative to our other segments and a decline
in the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment’s margin as discussed in more detail
below. 2004 gross profit margin also reflects improvements in our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment as sales increased in alternate site markets
which have higher margins and in our Information Solutions segment reflecting
lower contract loss accruals during the year.



McKESSON CORPORATION

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

reassessed our estimate of the costs to fulfill our contract obligations and
recorded a $51.0 million provision for the expected contract losses.

Partially offsetting the above, this segment’s gross margin benefited from
greater software revenues with higher margins.

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment uses the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”)
method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost
of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than do other accounting
methods, thereby mitigating the effects of inflation and deflation on operating
profit. The practice in the Pharmaceutical Solutions distribution businesses
is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers.
Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which prevents
inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in
this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in
other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in
those fiscal years.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Solutions segment, combined with improved operating profits in our
Information Solutions segment and for 2004, improved operating profits in our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.

Operating profit as a percentage of revenues decreased in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment in 2004 primarily reflecting the previously
discussed decline in gross margins, and an additional $30.0 million bad debt
provision for a customer bankruptcy. These decreases were offset in part by
productivity improvements in operations, a $21.7 million cash settlement of an
antitrust class action lawsuit brought against the manufacturer of a cardiac
drug and lower restructuring charges. Operating profit as a percentage of
revenues increased in 2003 reflecting productivity improvements in operations
offset in part by a decline in gross margins. In addition, operating profit in
2003 benefited from $9.9 million of gains on sales of venture investments.

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment’s operating profit as a percentage of
revenues increased in 2004 primarily reflecting improvements in gross profit
and a reduction in operating expenses. The reduction in operating expenses
includes the removal of duplicate operating costs (discussed in more detail
below), benefits from the segment’s 2003/2002 distribution center network
consolidation plan, as well as other operational improvements including a
significant decrease in bad debt expense. The segment is also anticipating
completing its information systems consolidation plan in 2005 and anticipates
continuing benefits from more efficient operations as a result of its
consolidation plans.

Operating profit as a percentage of revenues in 2003 for our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment approximated that of 2002. Starting in
2002, this segment experienced an increase in the competitive environment in
which it operates and the commencement of a self-warehousing strategy by a
major customer. These changes resulted in the initiation of the segment’s
distribution center network consolidation plan which included $29.6 million of
restructuring and related asset impairment charges. Results for 2003 and 2002
also include duplicate operating expenses associated with the segment’s
restructuring activities and replacement of information systems. Additional
operating expenses incurred include duplicate payroll, transportation and
warehouse costs as the segment consolidated distribution centers. In 2003,
operating profit benefited from $12.0 million in reversals of the prior year’s
accrued restructuring charges as a result of a modification to the segment’s
distribution center network consolidation plan. This benefit was partially
offset by an increase in bad debt expense of approximately $11 million.

Information Solutions segment’s operating profit as a percentage of
revenues increased in 2004 and 2003. Operating profit for 2004 reflects a
higher gross profit margin, $66.4 million of reversals of customer settlement
reserves due to favorable settlements and negotiations, and better control of
expenses. Operating profit for 2003 reflects improvements in gross profit
offset by a $51.0 million provision for expected losses on five multi-year
contracts within the segment’s international business, a $22.3 million credit
for the reversal of a portion of customer settlement reserves and more
efficient operations resulting from improved customer support activities and
control of expenses. In 2002, this segment incurred $19.3 million of losses on
sales of businesses and $12.0 million in restructuring and related asset
impairment charges.

Corporate expenses increased in 2004 and 2003. Expenses for 2004 reflect
a $21.0 million charge for uncollected balances on loans made to former
employees for the purchase of McKesson common stock primarily in February 1999,
additional legal costs associated with our pending securities litigation,
higher pension expense and severance costs associated with the restructuring of
our enterprise-wide information network support departments. Partially
offsetting these increases was approximately $13 million of gains on the sales
of surplus properties. The increase in 2003 expenses was principally due to
higher benefit and insurance costs and lower pension income, partially offset
by lower venture investment impairment losses, lower expenses associated with
the use of our accounts receivable sales facility and a decrease in expenses
associated with an investment.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense decreased in 2004 primarily due to
lower average borrowings, including the repayment of $125.0 million of 6.55%
notes in November 2002. Interest expense increased nominally in 2003 primarily
due to higher average borrowings including the issuance of $400.0 million 7.75%
notes in January 2002 partially offset by the retirement of $175.0 million
6.875% notes in March 2002 and $125.0 million 6.55% notes in November 2002. In
addition, we also utilized our accounts receivable sales facility more in 2003
compared to 2004 and 2002 in order to meet our financing needs. The costs
associated with this facility are recorded in Corporate expenses.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Income Taxes:

The Company’s effective tax rate was 29.1%, 34.0% and 29.9%
in 2004, 2003 and 2002. In addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in
the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within state and foreign
effective tax rates resulting from the Company’s business mix, including a
higher proportion of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower
income tax rates. In addition, our effective tax rate in 2004 also benefited
from various state tax initiatives.

In 2004, we recorded a $23.2 million tax benefit relating to favorable tax
settlements and adjustments with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and with
various taxing authorities. A large portion of this benefit, which was not
previously recognized by the Company, resulted from the filing of amended tax
returns by our subsidiary, McKesson Information Solutions (formerly known as
HBO & Company) for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.

In 2002, we sold three businesses for a pre-tax loss of $22.0 million and
an after-tax gain of $22.0 million. For accounting purposes, the net assets of
one of these businesses were written down in 2001 in connection with the
restructuring of a former segment. The tax benefit could not be recognized
until 2002 when the sale of the business was completed.

Discontinued Operations:

Net loss from discontinued operations was $6.7
million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2003 and $3.2 million ($0.01 per diluted
share) in 2002. Results from discontinued operations include those of a
marketing fulfillment business which we sold in 2003 as well as adjustments
made in 2003 relating to the 2000 divestiture of our Water Products business.

Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding:

Diluted earnings per share
were calculated based on an average number of shares outstanding of 298.6
million, 298.8 million and 298.1 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

International Operations

International operations accounted for 6.7%, 6.3% and 6.0% of 2004, 2003
and 2002 of consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to
certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and
adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political
environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional
information regarding our international operations is also included in
Financial Notes 4 and 21, “Contracts” and “Segments of Business” to the

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2004, net charges for restructuring activities, excluding customer
settlement reserve reversals, amounted to $3.8 million. These charges related
to a number of smaller initiatives offset in part by adjustments to prior
years’ restructuring reserves.

In 2003, net credits for restructuring activities, excluding customer
settlement reserve reversals, amounted to $4.8 million. These net credits
primarily related to $12.0 million of reversals of severance and exit-related
accruals pertaining to our re-evaluation of our 2002 Medical-Surgical Solutions
segment distribution center network consolidation plan. The original
consolidation plan included a net reduction of 20 distribution centers, from
51, compared to a net reduction of 14 under the revised plan. Net credits for
2003 also include $5.1 million of charges for additional facility closure costs
associated with prior years’ restructuring plans in our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment.

In 2002, net charges for restructuring activities of $39.8 million
included severance charges of $19.8 million, exit-related charges of $19.5
million and asset impairment charges of $7.6 million primarily related to a
plan to reduce the number of distribution centers in our Medical-Surgical
Solutions segment, as well as restructuring activities in our Information
Solutions segment. Partially offsetting these charges was a reversal of $7.1
million of prior years’ restructuring reserves due to a change in estimated
costs to complete these activities.

In addition to the above restructuring activities, we are still managing a
2001/2000 restructuring plan associated with customer settlements for the
discontinuance of overlapping and nonstrategic products and other product
development projects within our Information Solutions segment. In 2004 and
2003, we reversed $66.4 million and $22.3 million of accrued customer
settlement reserves into operating profit due to favorable settlements and
negotiations with affected customers. Total cash and non-cash settlements of
$45.3 million and $95.0 million have been incurred since the inception of this
restructuring plan. As of March 31, 2004, customer settlement reserves
amounted to $6.2 million and we had substantially completed our negotiations
with the affected customers. As a result, we do not anticipate additional
significant increases to the allowance for customer settlements. However, as
settlement negotiations with the remaining customers are finalized, additional
adjustments to the reserve may be necessary.

Refer to Financial Note 5, “Restructuring and Related Asset Impairments,”
to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion
regarding our restructuring activities.

Acquisitions

approximately $40 million, the proceeds of which consisted of an interest
bearing ten-year note receivable, resulting in a nominal loss.

During the last three years we also completed several smaller acquisitions
and investments within our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Information Solutions
segments. Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have

2005 Outlook

Information regarding the Company’s 2005 outlook, including business risks
and opportunities, is contained in our Form 8-K dated April 29, 2004. This
Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections “Factors Affecting
Forward-looking Statements” and “Additional Factors That May Affect Future
Results” included in this Financial Review.

2005 Operating Segments

In April 2004, we reconfigured our operating segments to better align
product development and selling efforts with the evolving needs of the
healthcare market. As a result, commencing in the first quarter of 2005, we
will report the following operating segments:

The Pharmaceutical Solutions segment distributes ethical and proprietary
drugs and health and beauty care products throughout North America. This
segment also manufactures and sells automated pharmaceutical dispensing systems
for retail pharmacies, medical management and pharmaceutical solutions for
biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, patient and payor services, and
consulting and outsourcing services to pharmacies. We have added the Clinical
Auditing and Compliance business, which was previously included in our
Information Solutions segment, to this segment’s expanded payor services
business. This business sells software to payors for auditing professional
claims.

The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distributes medical-surgical
supplies and equipment and provides logistics and related services within the
United States. This segment will now include Zee Medical, which was formerly
reported in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Zee Medical provides first
aid and safety products and training services to corporate customers. The
results of our April 2004 acquisition of MMC will also be reported in this
segment.

The Provider Technologies segment consists of the former Information
Solutions segment plus the McKesson Inpatient Automation business, which was
previously reported in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, and the Corporate
Solutions group, which was previously managed by our Corporate group and whose
expenses are currently allocated to the applicable business segments. This
segment continues to deliver enterprise-wide patient care, clinical, financial,
supply chain, managed care and strategic management software solutions as well
as outsourcing and other services to healthcare organizations throughout North
America, the United Kingdom and Europe. McKesson Inpatient Automation provides
automation and robotics for the hospital market, and the Corporate Solutions
group will continue to be responsible for the sales coordination of complex
provider engagements that include strategic product and service solutions from
multiple business units.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires
us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the
accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably
could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate
that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a
material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below
are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our
operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are
described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to our
consolidated financial statements. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such
estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Valuation of Receivables:

We provide short-term credit and other customer
financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services.
Other customer financing relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or
their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories, and lease and credit
financing. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full
collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge
regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance is
recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts

.

If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’
financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for
uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing
and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. At March
31, 2004, trade and notes receivables were $5,182.2 million, and other customer
financing was $227.0 million, both prior to allowances of $145.3 million.

In addition, at March 31, 2004, we had $62.7 million of notes receivable
from certain of our current and former officers and senior managers related to
purchases of common stock under our various employee stock purchase plans.
These notes were issued for amounts equal to the market value of the stock on
the date of the purchase, are full recourse to the borrower and were due at
various dates through February 2004. As of March 31, 2004, the value of the
underlying stock collateral was $30.4 million. We evaluate the collectability
of these notes on an ongoing basis and as a result, we recorded a $21.0 million
charge for notes due from former employees whose uncollected balances relate to
the purchase of the Company’s common stock primarily in February 1999. There
can be no assurance that we will recover the full amounts due under any of the
notes and we continue to assess their collectability.

Customer Settlement Reserves:

In 2001 and 2000, we announced plans to
discontinue overlapping and nonstrategic products or product development
projects and to redesign or stabilize several go-forward projects within our
Information Solutions segment. As a result of this decision, we recorded a
total of $235.2 million for estimated customer settlements. These estimates
were developed using a customer and product specific approach, based on
numerous interactions with our customers.

The determination and quantification of our customer settlement
liabilities along with the assessment of an appropriate reserve for
uncollectible accounts required significant judgment. Factors that reflected
our estimated accrued settlement amounts include, but are not limited to, our
success in amending contract terms to provide new or different products and
services or negotiating settlements with affected customers, and our ability to
complete projects where re-design or stabilization was required. In 2004 and
2003, due to favorable settlements and negotiations with affected customers, we
reversed $66.4 million and $22.3 million of the accrued customer settlement
reserve as a credit to operating expenses. Total cash and non-cash settlements
of $45.3 million and $95.0 million have been incurred since the inception of
the restructuring plan. As of March 31, 2004, customer settlement allowances
amounted to $6.2 million. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, we
substantially completed our negotiations with the affected customers. As a
result, we do not anticipate additional significant increases to the allowance
for customer settlements. However, as settlement negotiations with the
remaining customers are finalized, additional adjustments to the reserve may be
necessary.

Valuation of Inventories:

We state inventories at the lower of cost or
market. Inventories for our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical
Solutions segments consist of merchandise held for resale. For our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic
inventories was determined on the LIFO method and international inventories are
stated using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost of inventories for
our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment was primarily determined on the FIFO
method. Information Solutions segment’s inventories consist of computer
hardware with cost determined either by the specific identification or the FIFO
method. Total inventories before the LIFO cost adjustment, which approximates
replacement cost, were $6,981.5 million and $6,241.0 million at March 31, 2004
and 2003. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider
various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by
reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted
sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences
due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products, or the
loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the
value of our inventories.

Valuation of Goodwill:

We have significant goodwill assets as a result of
acquiring businesses. We account for goodwill under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires us to maintain goodwill assets on
our books unless the assets are deemed to be impaired. We perform an
impairment test on goodwill balances annually or when indicators of impairment
exist. Such impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value
of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the operations in
which goodwill is assigned. If carrying value exceeds fair value, a second
step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment. Fair values can
be determined using income, market or cost approaches.

We predominately use a discounted cash flow model derived from internal
budgets in assessing fair values for our goodwill impairment testing. Factors
that could change the result of our goodwill impairment test include, but are
not limited to, different assumptions used to forecast future revenues,
expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements used in our
cash flow models. In addition, selection of a risk-adjusted discount rate on



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

the estimated undiscounted cash flows is susceptible to future changes in
market conditions, and when unfavorable, can adversely affect our original
estimates of fair values. At March 31, 2004, we concluded that there was no
impairment in our goodwill.

Contract Accounting:

We use the percentage of completion method of
accounting to recognize certain revenues and costs, primarily for long-term
software contracts within our Information Solutions segment. This method of
accounting requires us to estimate the timing and amounts of total revenue to
be earned and total costs to be incurred over the life of a contract. Revenue
estimates are derived primarily from negotiated contract prices modified by
assumptions regarding change orders and assumptions regarding penalty
provisions associated with technical performance. Cost estimates are based
primarily on the expected amount of resources required to complete project
requirements. Based on the relationship of total estimated labor costs
incurred to date to total estimated labor costs to be incurred, a gross margin
percentage is developed. The amount reported as gross margin is determined by
applying the estimated gross margin percentage to the amount of revenue
recognized each period.

The estimated revenue to be earned and costs to complete a project can
change significantly throughout the period of a contract. Factors that could
change estimates include, but are not limited to, the ability to successfully
complete milestones, the timing of milestones, and modifications in the amount
of resources or other costs required to complete the project. Changes in
estimates to complete, and revisions in overall profit estimates on percentage
of completion contracts, are recognized in the period in which they are
determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current estimate of
total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue. Such a provision is
subject to change as additional information is obtained and as contracts
progress towards completion.

As previously discussed, we have made material adjustments to our gross
profit due to changes in estimates in accounting for certain contracts. In
addition, in 2002, we entered into a $500 million, ten year contract with the
National Health Services Information Authority (“NHS”), an organization of the
British government charged with the responsibility of delivering healthcare in
England and Wales. The contract engages the Company to develop, implement and
operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 NHS locations.
To date, there have been delays to this contract which have caused increased
costs and a decrease in the amount of time in which we can earn revenues.
These delays have adversely impacted the contract’s projected profitability and
no material revenue has yet been recognized on this contract. As of March 31,
2004, our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of approximately
$76 million in net assets, consisting of prepaid expenses, software and capital
assets, net of cash received, related to this contract. While we believe it is
likely that we can deliver and operate an acceptable system and recover our
investment in this contract, we are currently negotiating with the NHS
to amend certain key terms and conditions in the contract, and there is no
certainty we will agree on an updated implementation plan. We expect this
negotiation to be completed in the second half of calendar year 2004. However,
the timing and the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain and failure to
reach agreement on an updated implementation plan and amend certain key
contract terms and conditions, and/or further delays in the implementation may
result in losses that could be material. Even if we agree on amended contract
terms and conditions and an updated implementation plan, it is possible that
the terms of that agreement may result in the impairment of our net assets
related to the contract as well as substantial penalties and charges, which
could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Stock Options:

We account for employee stock-based compensation in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is
recorded based on a stock option’s intrinsic value, which is the difference
between the market value of a company’s stock and the exercise price at the
date of grant. As we generally grant stock options to employees at market
value at the date of grant, compensation expense as a result of option grants
has been nominal.

An alternative to APB No. 25 in accounting for stock options is Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Stock-Based Compensation.”
SFAS No. 123 utilizes the fair value method in valuing stock options and
requires expensing of such values. Fair value is determined based on an option
pricing model with the Black-Scholes model currently being the most widely
available and used model. Such models require the use of several estimates
including expected life of the option, volatility of our common stock, dividend
yields (which includes estimates of future dividends and market values of our
common stock), risk-free interest rates and employee turnover.

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an exposure
draft, “Equity Based Compensation,” which if approved, would mandate the
expensing of stock options in a manner similar to that of



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

SFAS No. 123. This potential accounting standard would be effective for
our 2006 fiscal year and would include compensation expense for all awards that
vest in 2006.

Had we accounted for employee stock options in accordance with SFAS No.
123 for all awards that vested during the year (as calculated under the
Black-Scholes model), net income and diluted earnings per share for 2004 would
have been:

expense (or $0.39 per diluted share) associated with the acceleration of
substantially all unvested stock options outstanding whose exercise price was
equal to or greater than $28.20, or substantially all of the total unvested
stock options outstanding.

Securities Litigation:

As discussed in Financial Note 18, “Other
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, we are involved in a number of lawsuits regarding the
restatement of our 1999 historical financial statements. Our directors and
officers’ liability insurance policies cover some of our restatement litigation
costs up to specified aggregate limits. For costs not covered under our
insurance policies, we accrue for litigation defense and settlement costs when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. We expensed $17.7 million, $3.9 million and $2.2 million
in 2004, 2003 and 2002, in connection with these matters. Due to an
acceleration of activities related to the litigation, we anticipate this
expense to increase by approximately $20 million in 2005.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of these proceedings, or to estimate the amount of, or potential
range of, loss with respect to these proceedings, and therefore, no accrual for
legal settlement is recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these legal proceedings is
uncertain. The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could
include judgments against us or settlements that could require substantial
payments by us that could cause us to incur material losses which could have a
material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Income Taxes:

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous
foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the
worldwide provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. To the
extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income
tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash flow from operating activities was $563.4 million in 2004,
compared with $710.3 million in 2003 and $336.9 million in 2002. Net cash flow
from operating activities improved over the last two years primarily reflecting
greater earnings, offset in part by net increases in working capital required
to support our revenue growth. In addition, 2002 net cash flow from operations
reflects certain purchasing opportunities. Partially offsetting these
increases in working capital were improvements made in working capital
management.

Net cash used by investing activities was $267.9 million in 2004, compared
with $600.9 million in 2003 and $404.3 million in 2002. Net cash flow used in
investing activities was greater in 2003 primarily due to $347.0 million paid
for the acquisition of A.L.I. and an increase in software expenditures. These
increases were partially offset by $117.9 million of proceeds from the sale of
notes receivable. Expenditures for capitalized software reflect our investment
in software developed for internal use and for resale.

Financing activities utilized cash of $109.5 million and $145.2 million in
2004 and 2003 and provided cash of $191.7 million in 2002. Financing
activities for 2004 include $156.8 million of stock repurchases and the receipt
of $32.8 million pertaining to the collection of employee loans. Fiscal 2003
financing activities include the repayment of $125.0 million of term debt that
had matured and 2002 financing activities reflect our public offering of $400.0



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

million of 7.75% unsecured notes, due in 2012. These notes are redeemable
at any time, in whole or in part, at our option. Net proceeds from the
issuance of these notes were used to repay $175.0 million of term debt and for
other general corporate purposes.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we repurchased 3.9 million, 0.9 million and 1.3
million shares of our common stock for $115.1 million, $25.0 million and $44.2
million. In 2004, we effectively completed a $250.0 million repurchase program
initiated in 2001 which resulted in the repurchase of a total of 8.3 million
shares of our common stock. Also in 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors
approved a new program to repurchase up to $250.0 million of additional common
stock of the Company. Under this new program, we have repurchased 1.4 million
shares for $41.5 million. Stock repurchases may be made in open or private
transactions.

Working capital primarily includes receivables and inventories, net of
drafts and accounts payable and deferred revenue. Our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is
susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory
purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a
function of sales activity, new customer build-up requirements and the desired
level of investment inventory. Consolidated working capital has increased over
the past two years primarily as a result of our higher sales volume.

We reduced our ratio of net debt to net capital employed and increased our
return on equity over the past two years. Improvements reflect a growth in our
operating profit in excess of the growth in working capital and other
investments needed to fund the increase in revenue.

MMC.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions
(primarily for our Canadian business) under which we have guaranteed the
repurchase of inventory at a discount in the event these customers are unable
to meet certain obligations to those financial institutions. Among other
limitations, these inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also
guaranteed loans, credit facilities and the payment of leases for some
customers; and we are a secured lender for substantially all of these
guarantees. Customer guarantees range from one to ten years and were primarily
provided to facilitate financing for certain strategic customers. At March 31,
2004, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer
guarantees were $169.1 million and $57.9 million. On April 21, 2004, we
converted a $40.0 million credit facility guarantee in favor of a customer to a
note receivable due from this customer. This secured note bears interest and
is repayable in 2007. In conjunction with this modification, an inventory
repurchase guarantee in favor of this customer for approximately $12 million
has been terminated. We consider it unlikely that we would make significant
payments under these guarantees, and accordingly, amounts accrued for these
guarantees were nominal.

In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $65.4 million
of standby letters of credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet
the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and
fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability
programs.

Credit Resources:

We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash, short-term
borrowings and our receivables sale facility. In September 2003, we
renegotiated our 364-day revolving credit arrangement. With the exception that
the facility was increased by $100.0 million to $650.0 million, the terms of
the new agreement are substantially similar to those previously in place. This
renewed facility expires in September 2004. We have a three-year $550.0
million revolving credit facility that expires in September 2005. These
facilities are primarily intended to support our commercial paper borrowings.
We also have a $1.1 billion revolving receivables sale facility, which expires
in June 2004. We anticipate renewing our existing capacity under these
facilities prior to their expirations. No amounts were outstanding under any
of these facilities at March 31, 2004.

Our senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s are currently
BBB, BBB and Baa2, and our commercial paper ratings are currently A-2, F-2, and
P-2. Our ratings are stable, except for the Moody’s which is on a negative
credit outlook. Our various borrowing facilities and certain long-term debt
instruments are subject to covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt
to capital ratio, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio,
repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $335.0
million of term debt could be accelerated. At March 31, 2004, this ratio was
22.3% and we were in compliance with all other covenants. A reduction in our
credit ratings or the lack of compliance with our covenants could result in a
negative impact on our ability to finance our operations through our credit
facilities, as well as the issuance of additional debt at the interest rates
then currently available.

Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements
are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flows from operations,
existing credit sources and other capital market transactions.

MARKET RISKS

Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas
our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying
weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed
by 50 basis points in 2004, interest expense would not have been materially
different from that reported.

As of March 31, 2004, the aggregate fair value of our long-term debt was
$1,701.8 million. Fair value was estimated on the basis of quoted market
prices, although trading in these debt securities is limited and may not
reflect fair value. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our
performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes
in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms.

We derive revenues from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the
Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico. We also have a 22% equity
interest in a pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. We are subject to foreign
currency exchange risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and
investment transactions. If exchange rates on such currencies were to
fluctuate 10%, we believe that our results from operations and cash flows could
be materially affected. Aggregate foreign exchange translation gains and
losses included in

RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS

Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is
included in “Critical Accounting Policies” appearing within this Financial
Review and Financial Note 20, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

There are a number of new accounting pronouncements that may impact our
financial results. These new pronouncements are described in Financial Note 1,
“Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, management’s discussion and
analysis includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)
and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”). Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by
use of forward-looking words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” or
“estimates,” or the negative of these words, or other comparable terminology.
The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans or intentions may also
include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such
risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed under “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” The
reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all
potential risks and uncertainties.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described herein or in our
other public documents. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We
undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to
these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following additional factors may affect our future results:

Adverse resolution of pending litigation regarding the restatement of our
historical financial statements may cause us to incur material losses.

Subsequent to our April 28, 1999 restatement of financial results
announcement, and as of March 31, 2004, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed
against us, certain of our current or former officers or directors, or those of
HBOC, and other defendants. In addition, the United States Attorney’s Office
for the Northern District of California and the San Francisco District Office
of the SEC also have ongoing investigations in connection with the matters
relating to the restatement of previously reported amounts.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of these proceedings, or to estimate the amount of, or potential
range of, loss with respect to these proceedings. In addition, the timing of
the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain. The range of possible
resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against us or
settlements that could require substantial payments by us, which could cause us
to incur material losses.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Changes in the United States healthcare environment could have a material
negative impact on our revenues and net income.

Our products and services are primarily intended to function within the
structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being
used in the United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has
changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. These changes include
increased use of managed care, cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply
distributors, and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups.

We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in
the future. Some of these changes, such as adverse changes in government
funding of healthcare services, legislation or regulations governing the
privacy of patient information, or the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals
and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry
participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they
purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services.

Changes in pharmaceutical and medical-surgical manufacturers’ pricing,
selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices, or changes in
our customer mix could also significantly reduce our revenues and net income.
Due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare
information technology products and services that we offer, such changes may
adversely impact us, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a
narrower range of products and services.

There have been increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to
control or limit the product availability in the supply channels, which impacts
the ways in which distributors are being compensated by manufacturers. For
instance, certain types of vendor product incentives and sources of supply,
such as certain inventory purchases on the secondary market, are not available
at historical levels to the major distributors which have the impact of
reducing gross margins. We have been actively working with manufacturers
through restructured distribution agreements to ensure that we are
appropriately compensated for the services we provide. However, if we fail to
negotiate favorable terms, such efforts by the pharmaceutical manufacturers may
have an adverse impact on our profitability.

Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic
drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of
certain drug patents. In recent years, our revenues and gross margins have
increased from our generic drug offering programs. An increase or a decrease
in the availability of these generic drugs could have a material impact on our
net income.

There has been increasing efforts by various levels of government
including state boards and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical
distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit drugs,
adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution
system. Certain states, such as Florida, have already adopted laws and
regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical
distribution system while other government agencies are currently evaluating
their recommendations. These laws and regulations could increase the overall
regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution
business, and may negatively impact our operating results.

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud.
The federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting the Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs.
  Furthermore, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse.
 Many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical or medical-surgical suppliers, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts.
 They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.

Substantial defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of our
products by large customers could have a significant negative impact on our
financial condition and results of operations and liquidity.

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with
a limited number of large customers. During the year ended March 31, 2004,
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of our total
consolidated revenues (including sales to customers’ warehouses). Sales to our
largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented approximately 11% of our
2004 total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2004, accounts receivable from
our ten largest customers and Rite Aid Corporation were approximately 50% and
8% of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit
concentration is significant. Any defaults in payment or a material reduction
in purchases from this or any other large customer could have a significant
negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments are
dependent upon sophisticated information systems. The implementation delay,
malfunction or failure of these systems for any extended period of time could
adversely affect our business.

We rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain,
rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: facilitate the purchase and
distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution
centers; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; manage the
accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and process
payments to suppliers. Our business and results of operations may be
materially adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by
unforeseen events, or fail for any extended period of time.

We could become subject to liability claims that are not adequately covered by
our insurance, and may have to pay damages and other expenses which could have
a material adverse effect on us.

Our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution and
dispensing of pharmaceuticals, the provision of ancillary services (such as our
pharmacy management business) and the conduct of our medical management
businesses (which include disease management programs and our nurse triage
services.) A successful product or professional liability claim not fully
covered by our insurance or any applicable contractual indemnity could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

The ability of our Information Solutions business to attract and retain
customers due to challenges in software product integration and technological
advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Our Information Solutions business delivers enterprise-wide patient care,
clinical, financial, managed care, payor and strategic management software
solutions, as well as networking technologies, electronic commerce, outsourcing
and other services to healthcare organizations throughout the United States and
certain foreign countries. Challenges in integrating Information Solutions
software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and
may reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead
to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the
products and services offered by our Information Solutions business. Such
technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services
or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure. The success of our
Information Solutions business will depend, in part, on its ability to be
responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing
business models. To remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information
systems marketplace, our Information Solutions business must develop new
products on a timely basis. The failure to develop competitive products and to
introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our
Information Solutions business to attract and retain customers and thereby
significantly reduce our net income.

The loss of third party licenses utilized by our Information Solutions segment
may adversely impact our operating results.

We license the rights to use certain technologies from third-party vendors
to incorporate in or complement our Information Solutions segment products and
solutions. These licenses are generally nonexclusive, must be renewed
periodically by mutual consent, and may be terminated if we breach the terms of
the license. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product
shipments until we obtain equivalent technology, which could hurt our business.
Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by
these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us. In
addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed
technology in the future, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own
products.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and proprietary rights
may infringe on the rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark
laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to
protect our proprietary rights to our products. There can be no assurance that
these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not
independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technology. Although we believe that our products and other
proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third
parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims
against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement claims against us in the future. If we were found to be
infringing on other’s rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage
awards and forced to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or
cease selling the products that contain the infringing property. Additionally,
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets,
to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights, and to determine the
scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These types of
litigation can be costly and time consuming. These litigation expenses, damage
payments, or cessation of use of infringing technology and development of
respective replacement technology could be significant and result in material
losses to us.

Potential product liability claims arising from healthcare information
technology business products could result in material losses to us.

We provide products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to
patient medical histories and treatment plans. If these products fail to
provide accurate and timely information, customers could assert liability
claims against us. Litigation with respect to liability claims, regardless of
the outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management’s
attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. We
attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages from negligence,
errors or mistakes. Despite this precaution, the limitations of liability set
forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us
from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage,
including coverage for errors and omissions. However, this coverage may not
continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in
sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us. In addition,
the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.

System errors and warranties in Information Solutions segment’s products could
cause unforeseen liabilities.

Our Information Solutions segment’s software and software systems
(“systems”) are very complex. As with complex systems offered by others, our
systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. Our Information
Solutions business systems are intended to provide information for healthcare
providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our systems have a
greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products.
Failure of a client’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation
could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional
expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. If such
failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material
breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain
refunds of amounts previously paid, or assert claims for significant damages.

Potential regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of
Information Solutions products as medical devices could impose increased costs,
delay the introduction of new products and negatively impact our business.

The FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer
software intended for use in the healthcare industry. The FDA has increasingly
focused on the regulation of computer products and computer-assisted products
as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If the FDA
chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose
extensive requirements upon us. If we fail to comply with the applicable
requirements, the FDA could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil
penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production,
refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and
initiating criminal prosecution. Any final FDA policy governing computer
products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing
products or may prevent us from marketing our products.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

New and potential federal regulations relating to patient confidentiality and
format and data content standards could depress the demand for our Information
Solutions products and impose significant product redesign costs and unforeseen
liabilities on us.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and
the circumstances under which those records may be released. These regulations
govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record
information and will require the users of such information to implement
specified security measures. Regulations currently in place governing
electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear
and difficult to apply.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA,
requires national standards for some types of electronic health information
transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, security
standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and
standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health
information. Healthcare organizations were required to comply with the privacy
standards by April 2003 and additional transaction regulations by October 2003.
Such organizations must also be in compliance with security regulations by
April 2005.

Information Solutions systems have been updated and modified to comply
with the current requirements of HIPAA. In addition, the division has been
testing and sending HIPAA compliant transactions through its clearinghouse
directly to payors and to competitive clearinghouses. However, not all testing
is complete, and there are payors and competitive clearinghouses which cannot
yet accommodate all HIPAA compliant transactions. The Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has indicated that it will delay payment of
nonstandard electronic transactions by an additional two weeks as of July 1,
2004. CMS has implemented a flexible, complaint-driven enforcement strategy
regarding electronic transactions, taking into account good faith efforts to
comply with the HIPAA standards. It is possible, however, that CMS may change
its existing enforcement strategy in the future in a manner that increases the
likelihood of fines or penalties for non-compliance with standards. To the
extent that other payors adopt policies similar to CMS regarding adjudication
and payment of nonstandard electronic transactions and testing of standard
transactions has not been completed with such payors, payor reimbursement of
claims submitted by customers through the McKesson clearinghouse may be slowed,
thereby negatively impacting the demand for our clearinghouse services and
negatively affecting our financial condition.

Evolving HIPAA-related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of
our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information. This could
adversely affect demand for our products if they are not re-designed in a
timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations that
seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our
customers to execute new or modified healthcare transactions. We may need to
expend additional capital, research and development and other resources to
modify our products to address these evolving data security and privacy issues.

Due to the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our Information
Solutions segment, our future operating results may be impacted.

Our Information Solutions segment has long sales and implementation
cycles, which could range from several months to over two years or more from
initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. How and
when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add
business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. The
solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and
time commitments by the customer. Any decision by our customers to delay
implementation may adversely affect our revenues. Furthermore, delays or
failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a
breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as
well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize
revenue.

Reduced capacity in the commercial property insurance market exposes us to
potential loss.

In order to provide prompt and complete service to our major
Pharmaceutical Solutions customers, we maintain significant product inventory
at certain of our distribution centers. While we seek to maintain property
insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no
assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on
acceptable terms. One or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake
or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could materially
harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate
acquisitions successfully.

An element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate
acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. Integration of
acquisitions involves a number of risks, including the diversion of
management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we
have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and
the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and
retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; challenges in retaining
the customers of the combined businesses; and potential adverse effects on
operating results. In addition, we may potentially require additional
financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be
attainable. If we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic
acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could
be negatively affected.

In addition to the above, the following factors could affect future
results: changes in generally accepted accounting principles, including the
requirement by accounting setting standards boards to expense stock options;
tax legislation initiatives, foreign currency fluctuations and general economic
and market conditions.



McKESSON CORPORATION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors of

McKesson Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2004. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item
15(a). These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and
subsidiaries at March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the fiscal period ended
March 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Financial Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company is involved in certain shareholder litigation related to HBO & Company
and subsidiaries.

As discussed in Financial Note 1, in fiscal 2003 the Company changed its method
of accounting for discontinued operations to conform to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

.

As also discussed in Financial Note 1, in fiscal 2004 the Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,

and retroactively restated the fiscal 2003 and 2002
financial statements.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations.

The consolidated financial statements of McKesson
Corporation (“McKesson,” the “Company,” or “we” and other similar pronouns)
include the financial statements of all majority-owned or controlled companies.
Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on
March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall
mean the Company’s fiscal year.

We conduct our business through three segments: Pharmaceutical Solutions,
Medical-Surgical Solutions and Information Solutions. The Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment includes our U.S. and Canadian pharmaceutical and healthcare
products distribution businesses and a 22% equity interest in a pharmaceutical
distributor in Mexico, Nadro S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”). Our U.S. Pharmaceutical
Solutions business also includes the manufacture and sale of automated
pharmaceutical dispensing systems for hospitals and retail pharmacies, medical
management and specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and
pharmaceutical manufacturers, patient and payor services, consulting and
outsourcing services to pharmacies, and distribution of first-aid products to
industrial and commercial customers. The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment
distributes medical-surgical supplies and equipment, and provides logistics and
related services within the U.S. The Information Solutions segment delivers
enterprise-wide clinical, revenue cycle and resource management software
solutions, as well as technology, outsourcing and other professional services,
to healthcare organizations throughout North America, certain European
countries and the United Kingdom.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

include all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale

are carried at fair value and the
net unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in
marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders’
equity.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories for
the Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments consist of
merchandise held for resale. For our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, the
majority of the cost of domestic inventories were determined on the last-in,
first-out (“LIFO”) method and international inventories stated using the
first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost of inventories for our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment was primarily determined on the FIFO method.
Information Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with
cost determined either by the specific identification or the FIFO method. The
LIFO method was used to value approximately 90% of our inventories at March 31,
2004 and 2003. Total inventories before the LIFO cost adjustment, which
approximates replacement cost, were $6,981.5 million and $6,241.0 million at
March 31, 2004 and 2003. Allowances received from vendors are generally
accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when
the inventory is sold.

Property, Plant and Equipment

is stated at cost and depreciated on the
straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of properties
over estimated service lives ranging from one to 50 years.

Capitalized Software Held for Sale

consists of development costs for
software held for sale primarily for our Information Solutions segment. Such
costs are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological
feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of
general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated
useful life of approximately three years. We monitor the net realizable value
of capitalized software held for sale to ensure that the investment will be
recovered through future sales.

Long-lived Assets.

We assess the recoverability of goodwill on at least
an annual basis and other long-lived assets when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets, including
goodwill, which we expect to hold and use, is based on estimated fair values of
the assets. Estimates of fair values are based on quoted market prices, when
available, the results of valuation techniques utilizing discounted cash flows
(using the lowest level of identifiable cash flows) or fundamental analysis.
Long-lived assets to be disposed of, either by sale or abandonment, are
reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use

is amortized over estimated
useful lives ranging from one to ten years and is included in other assets in
the consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, capitalized
software held for internal use was $389.3 million and $325.5 million, net of
accumulated amortization of $182.0 million and $127.7 million.

Insurance Programs.

Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain
coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required to be
insured by law or contract. It is our policy to retain a significant portion
of certain losses primarily related to workers’ compensation and comprehensive
general, product, and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under
these programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability
for claims incurred. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial assumptions
followed in the insurance industry.

Revenue Recognition

. Revenues for our Pharmaceutical Solutions and
Medical-Surgical Solutions segments are recognized when all of the following
criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is
fixed or determinable, product delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, there are no further obligations to customers, and collectability is
probable. Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances and rebates.
Sales returns are recorded when goods are returned to us and are generally not
accepted unless the inventory can be returned to the manufacturer for
credit. Sales returns were approximately $766 million,
$755 million and $721 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
Amounts recorded in revenue and cost of sales under this accounting policy approximate what would have been
recorded under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 48,
“Revenue Recognition when Right of Return Exists.” Included in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment revenues are large volume sales of
pharmaceuticals to a limited number of large self-warehousing customers whereby
we order and subsequently deliver bulk products directly from the manufacturer
to the customers’ warehouses through a central distribution facility. In
addition to these revenues, we also record revenues associated with direct
store deliveries from most of these same customers. Sales to customer warehouses
amounted to $21.6 billion in 2004, $14.8 billion in 2003, and $13.2 billion in
2002. These sales are recorded gross as we take title to and possession of the
inventory and assume the risk of loss for collection, delivery or return.
We have significantly lower gross margin on these sales as we pass
much of the efficiencies of this low cost-to-serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars in that the volume allows us to earn incremental product sourcing profits.

Revenues for our Information Solutions segment are generated primarily by
licensing software systems (consisting of software, hardware and maintenance
support), and providing outsourcing and professional services. Revenue for
this segment is recognized as follows:

Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well
as service agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the
time of delivery or under the percentage-of-completion contract method in
accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue
Recognition,” and SOP 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type
and Certain Production-Type Contracts,” based on the terms and conditions in
the contract. Contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion
method are generally measured based on the ratio of labor costs incurred to
date to total estimated labor costs to be incurred. Changes in estimates to
complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are
charged to earnings in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for
contract losses if and when the current estimate of total contract costs
exceeds total contract revenue.

Hardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue from
multi-year software license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of
the agreement. Software implementation fees are recognized as



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion contract
method. Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or
multiyear agreements and are recognized ratably over the period covered by the
agreements. Remote processing service fees are recognized monthly as the
service is performed. Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the
service is performed.

We also offer our products on an application service provider (“ASP”)
basis, making available our software functionality on a remote hosting basis
from our data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative
support as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on an ASP basis
is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract starting when
the hosting services begin.

This segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may
contain any combination of software, hardware, implementation or consulting
services, or maintenance services. When some elements are delivered prior to
others in an arrangement and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
(“VSOE”) exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered
elements is recognized upon delivery of such items. The segment establishes
VSOE for hardware and implementation and consulting services based on the price
charged when sold separately, and for maintenance services, based on renewal
rates offered to customers. Revenue for the software element is recognized
under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all of
the undelivered elements in an arrangement. If fair value cannot be
established for any undelivered element, all of the arrangement’s revenue is
deferred until the delivery of the last element or until the fair value of the
undelivered element is determinable.

Income Taxes

. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in
the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Foreign Currency Translation.

Assets and liabilities of international
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.
Cumulative currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
comprehensive losses in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated
balance sheets. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions
are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations
and were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2004, 2003
or 2002.

Derivative Financial Instruments

. Derivative financial instruments are
used principally in the management of our foreign currency and interest rate
exposures and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value
of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated
as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses and are
recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged item
affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash
flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative
instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each
accounting period with the results included in earnings.

Concentrations of Credit Risk.

Trade receivables subject us to a
concentration of credit risk with customers primarily in our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment. A significant proportion of our revenue growth has been
with a limited number of large customers and as a result, our credit
concentration has increased. Accordingly, any defaults in payment by or a
reduction in purchases from these large customers could have a significant
negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity. At March 31, 2004, revenues and accounts receivable from our ten
largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of total consolidated
revenues and accounts receivable. Fiscal 2004 revenues and March 31, 2004
receivables from our largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented
approximately 11% of total consolidated revenues and 8% of accounts receivable.
We have also provided financing arrangements to certain of our customers
within our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, some of which are on a revolving
basis. At March 31, 2004, these arrangements totaled $196.1 million and we
have a security interest in the customers’ assets.

Accounts Receivable Sales.

At March 31, 2004, we had a $1.1 billion
revolving receivables sales facility, which was fully available. The program
qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No. 140, “Accounting For Transfers and
Servicing Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” Sales are
recorded at the estimated fair values of the



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

receivables sold, reflecting discounts for the time value of money based
on U.S. commercial paper rates and estimated loss provisions. Discounts are
recorded in administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations.

Employee Stock Options.

We account for our employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” We
apply the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” Had compensation cost for our
employee stock-based compensation been recognized based on the fair value
method, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, net income and earnings
per share would have been as follows:

In 2004, we accelerated the vesting of substantially all unvested stock
options outstanding whose exercise price was equal to or greater than $28.20,
or substantially all of the total unvested stock options outstanding. SFAS No.
123 expense related to this acceleration amounted to approximately $117 million
(or $0.39 per diluted share) on an after-tax basis.

New Accounting Pronouncements

. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement
obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. In May 2002, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, 64, Amendment to
FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002.” SFAS No.
145 amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under
changed conditions. SFAS Nos. 143 and 145 became effective for 2004. The
adoption of these standards did not materially impact our consolidated
financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” that replaces SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of.” SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale, including those of discontinued operations, be measured at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Discontinued
operations are no longer measured at net realizable value or include amounts
for operating losses that have not yet been incurred. SFAS No. 144 also
broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of
an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity
and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations in a disposal
transaction. We adopted SFAS No. 144 as of April 1, 2002. The adoption of
this standard resulted in the classification of a disposition of a business as
a discontinued operation.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” which replaces Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.” SFAS No. 146
requires that liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities be
recognized when they are incurred. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for

exit costs was recognized at the date of a commitment to an exit plan. SFAS
No. 146 also requires that the liability be measured and recorded at fair
value. Accordingly, this standard may affect the timing of recognizing future
restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized. Liabilities recognized
prior to the initial application of SFAS No. 146 continue to be accounted for
in accordance with preexisting guidance. The provisions of SFAS No.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

146 were adopted for restructuring activities initiated after December 31,
2002 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” This interpretation elaborates
on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual
financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45
were effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002.
The initial recognition and measurement requirements of FIN No. 45 are
effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. The adoption of FIN No. 45 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus regarding EITF Issue No.
00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” EITF Issue No. 00-21
addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or
performance of multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The
guidance provided by EITF Issue No. 00-21 is effective for us on contracts
entered into on or after July 1, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Also, in November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus on EITF Issue No.
02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain
Consideration Received from a Vendor.” EITF Issue No. 02-16 provides that cash
consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the
prices of the vendor’s products or services and should, therefore, be
characterized as a reduction in cost of sales unless it is a payment for assets
or services delivered to the vendor, in which case the cash consideration
should be characterized as revenue, or it is a reimbursement of costs incurred
to sell the vendor’s products, in which case the cash consideration should be
characterized as a reduction of that cost. This consensus is generally
effective for new or modified agreements subsequent to November 2002. We were
previously accounting for rebates in accordance with this consensus, and as a
result, the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” This statement amends
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148
amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The Company has not yet adopted the fair value
method of accounting for stock-based compensation, however, as required, we
adopted the disclosure provisions of this standard in 2004.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” and in December 2003, a revised interpretation was issued
(FIN No. 46(R)). In general, a variable interest entity (“VIE”) is a
corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business
purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has
equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. FIN No. 46 requires a VIE to be consolidated
by a company if that company is designated as the primary beneficiary. The
interpretation applies to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and for all
financial statements issued after December 15, 2003 for VIEs in which an
enterprise held a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003.

We
implemented FIN Nos. 46 and 46(R) on a retroactive basis as required in
2004. As a result of the implementation, the Company no longer consolidates
its investment in the McKesson Financing Trust (the “Trust”) as the Company was
not designated as the Trust’s primary beneficiary. In accordance with this
accounting standard, the Company now recognizes the debentures issued to the
Trust as long-term debt in its consolidated financial statements in lieu of the
preferred securities that the Trust issued to third parties. Additionally, the
consolidated financial statements include interest expense on the debentures
and no longer report dividends on the preferred securities, net of tax. These
changes increased the Company’s net debt to net capital ratio slightly but did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including
diluted earnings per share.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends SFAS
No. 133 for decisions made as part of the FASB’s Derivatives



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Implementation Group process, other FASB projects dealing with financial
instruments, and in connection with implementation issues raised in relation to
the application of the definition of a derivative. This statement is generally
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for
hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”
SFAS No. 150 clarifies the definition of a liability as currently defined in
FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, “Elements of Financial Statements,” as well as
other planned revisions. This statement requires a financial instrument that
embodies an obligation of an issuer to be classified as a liability. In
addition, the statement establishes standards for the initial and subsequent
measurement of these financial instruments and disclosure requirements. SFAS
No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003 and for all other matters, at the beginning of our second quarter
of 2004. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, “Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. This statement does not change
the measurement or recognition aspects for pensions and other postretirement
benefit plans, however it does revise employers’ disclosures to include more
information about plan assets, obligations to pay benefits and funding
obligations. As required, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of
SFAS No. 132 in 2004.

In December 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition,” which supersedes SAB No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” SAB No. 104’s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting
guidance contained in SAB No. 101 related to multiple-element revenue
arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF Issue No.
00-21. Additionally, SAB No. 104 rescinds the SEC’s related Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers
issued with SAB No. 101 that had previously been codified by the SEC. While
the wording of SAB No. 104 reflects the issuance of EITF Issue No. 00-21, the
revenue recognition principles of SAB No. 101 remain largely unchanged by the
issuance of SAB No. 104, which was effective upon issuance. The adoption of
SAB No. 104 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

In January 2004, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position (“FSP”) 106-1,
“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” As permitted by FSP No.
106-1, we elected to defer recognizing the effects of the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) until authoritative
guidance on accounting for the new federal subsidy is issued. In May 2004, the
FASB issued FSP No. 106-2 which provides accounting guidance for this new
subsidy. The Company sponsors a number of postretirement benefit plans which
may benefit from the subsidy and as a result, we are currently evaluating the
impact of FSP No. 106-2, which we are required to adopt in our second quarter
of 2005.

2. Acquisitions

We made the following acquisitions:

–

In April 2004, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Moore Medical Corp. (“MMC”), of New Britain, Connecticut, for $12 per
share in cash or approximately $40 million in aggregate. MMC is an
Internet-enabled, multi-channel marketer and distributor of
medical-surgical and pharmaceutical products to non-hospital provider
settings. Financial results for MMC will be reflected as part of our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment in 2005.

–

In the second quarter of 2003, we acquired the outstanding stock of
A.L.I. Technologies Inc. (“A.L.I.”) for an aggregate cash purchase
price of $347.0 million. A.L.I. provides digital medical imaging
solutions which are designed to streamline access to diagnostic
information, automate clinical workflow and eliminate the need for
film purchase and storage. The acquisition of A.L.I. complemented our
Horizon Clinicals™ offering by incorporating medical images into a
computerized patient record. Approximately $328 million of A.L.I.’s
purchase price was assigned to goodwill, none of which is deductible
for tax purposes. The aggregate purchase



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

price was financed through cash and short-term borrowings. The results of
A.L.I.’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial
statements within our Information Solutions segment since its acquisition
date.

–

In February 2002, our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment acquired, for
approximately $62 million in cash, the net assets of PMO, Inc., a
national specialty pharmacy business (having previously done business
as VitaRx), that provides mail order pharmaceutical prescription
services to managed care patients.

–

In 2003, we purchased the remaining interest in an investment of our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment for approximately $32 million,
retained a small portion of the business and subsequently sold the
balance for approximately $40 million, the proceeds of which consisted
of an interest bearing ten-year note receivable, resulting in a
nominal loss.

During the last three years we also completed several smaller acquisitions
and investments within our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Information Solutions
segments. Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have
not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated
financial statements on either an individual or aggregate basis.

3. Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

In September 2002, we sold the net assets of a marketing fulfillment
business which was previously included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.
Net proceeds from the sale of this business were $4.5 million. The
disposition resulted in an after-tax loss of $3.7 million or $0.01 per diluted
share. The net assets and results of operations of this business have been
presented as a discontinued operation and, as a result, prior year amounts have
been reclassified.

In 2002, we sold three businesses, Abaton.com, Inc., Amisys Managed Care
Systems, Inc. and ProDental Corporation. Two of these businesses were from our
Information Solutions segment and one was from our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment. Net proceeds from the sale of these businesses were $0.2 million,
resulting in a pre-tax loss of $22.0 million and an after-tax gain of $22.0
million. For accounting purposes, the net assets of one of these businesses
were written down in 2001 in connection with the restructuring of a former
business segment. The tax benefit could not be recognized until 2002 when the
sale of the business was completed. In addition, as SFAS No. 144 was not
effective until 2003, the dispositions of these businesses were not treated as
discontinued operations.

4. Contracts

In 2003, we recorded a $51.0 million provision for expected losses on five
multi-year contracts in our Information Solutions segment’s international
business. Substantially all of the expected losses pertain to contracts that
were entered into in 2001 or earlier. These contracts contain multiple-element
deliverables, including customization of software. In addition, these
contracts place significant reliance on third party vendors as well as the
customers.

During the software development and implementation phases of these
contracts, despite experiencing certain operational issues, we believed these
contracts could be fully performed on a timely basis and remain profitable. In
2003, after experiencing numerous delays in product delivery and functionality,
we conducted a reassessment of the contract delivery and project methodology,
including assessment of our third party vendors’ ability to perform under these
contracts. We determined that certain contract obligations, including software
functionality, could not be met within existing contract cost estimates and
delivery dates. Accordingly, we reassessed our estimate of the costs to
fulfill our contract obligations and recorded a $51.0 million provision for the
expected contract losses.

During the third quarter of 2004, the Company and a customer decided to
exit one contract and had commenced discussions to mutually terminate the
contract and negotiate settlement terms and conditions, and as a result, we
recorded an additional $20.0 million contract loss provision. In the fourth
quarter of 2004, we reduced our accrued contract loss provision by $15.2
million primarily to reflect the final terms and conditions of our termination
agreement with this customer.

In 2004, net charges for restructuring activities, excluding customer
settlement reserve reversals, amounted to $3.8 million. These charges related
to a number of smaller initiatives offset in part by adjustments to prior
years’ restructuring reserves.

In 2003, net credits for restructuring activities, excluding customer
settlement reserve reversals, amounted to $4.8 million. These net credits
primarily related to $12.0 million of reversals of severance and exit-related
accruals pertaining to our re-evaluation of our 2002 Medical-Surgical Solutions
segment distribution center network consolidation plan. The original
consolidation plan included a net reduction of 20 distribution centers, from
51, compared to a net reduction of 14 under the revised plan. Net credits for
2003 also include $5.1 million of charges for additional facility closure costs
associated with prior years’ restructuring plans in our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment.

In 2002, net charges for restructuring activities of $39.8 million
included severance charges of $19.8 million, exit-related charges of $19.5
million and asset impairment charges of $7.6 million primarily related to a
plan to reduce the number of distribution centers in our Medical-Surgical
Solutions segment, as well as restructuring activities in our Information
Solutions segment. Partially offsetting these charges was a reversal of $7.1
million of prior years’ restructuring reserves due to a change in estimated
costs to complete these activities.

Accrued restructuring liabilities are included in other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balances at March 31, 2004 for
Corporate include approximately $7 million of retirement costs which were paid
in April 2004.

In addition to the above restructuring activities, we are still managing a
2001/2000 restructuring plan associated with customer settlements for the
discontinuance of overlapping and nonstrategic products and other product
development projects within our Information Solutions segment. In 2004 and
2003, we reversed $66.4 million and $22.3 million of accrued customer
settlement reserves into operating expenses due to favorable settlements and
negotiations with affected customers. There have been no significant
offsetting changes in estimates that increase the provision for customer
settlements. Total cash and non-cash settlements of $45.3 million and $95.0
million have been incurred since the inception of this restructuring plan.
Non-cash settlements represent write-offs of customer receivables.

The following table summarizes the activity related to the customer
settlement reserves for the three years ended March 31, 2004:

(b)

By the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we had completed, on a cumulative basis, settlements with 71% of our affected customers.
 Additionally, we announced the general availability of a critical software component of our clinical strategy, which helped us refine
our estimate of customers expected to move forward with the clinical product replacements and provided a more favorable prognosis of remaining settlements.
  Accordingly, we reversed $22.3 million of the customer settlement reserve in the fiscal year. In fiscal 2004, we had significant settlement activity, including the
 completion and execution of a number of the more difficult customer settlements.
  As of March 31, 2004, we were substantially complete (97%) with our customer settlements.  As a result, the customer settlement reserve was reduced by $66.4 million and we believe we have good estimates for the few remaining settlements.

Past settlements do not necessarily reflect future or projected settlement
amounts. Customer settlement reserves were established, reviewed and assessed
on a customer and contract specific basis, and actual settlements for each
customer varied significantly depending on the specific mix and number of
products, and each customer contract or contracts.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

By the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, we substantially completed our
negotiations with the affected customers. As a result, we do not anticipate
additional significant increases to the allowance for customer settlements.
However, as settlement negotiations with the remaining customers are finalized,
additional adjustments to the reserve may be necessary.

6. Gain (Loss) on Investments, Net

Gain (loss) on investments includes gains and losses from the sale or
liquidation of investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses. We
recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of $1.5 million, $8.5 million,
and $14.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002 on equity and joint venture
investments as a result of significant declines in the market values of these
investments. We used quoted market prices, if available, to determine the fair
value of our investments. For investments that do not trade regularly, we
estimated fair value using a variety of pricing techniques including discounted
cash flow analyses and market transactions.

the sales of $3.1 million and $5.3 million were recognized from these
receivable sales in 2004 and 2003.

8. Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per
share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised
or converted into common stock.

Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures

In February 1997, we issued 5% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures
(the “Debentures”) in an aggregate principal amount of $206,186,000. The
Debentures, which are included in long-term debt, mature on June 1, 2027, bear
interest at an annual rate of 5%, payable quarterly, and are currently
redeemable by us at 101.5% of the



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

principal amount. The Debentures were purchased by the Trust, which is
wholly owned by the Company, with proceeds from its issuance of four million
shares of preferred securities to the public and 123,720 common securities to
us. These preferred securities are convertible at the holder’s option into the
Company’s common stock. The Debentures represent the sole assets of the Trust.

Holders of the preferred securities are entitled to cumulative cash
distributions at an annual rate of 5% of the liquidation amount of $50 per
security. Each preferred security is convertible at the rate of 1.3418 shares
of the Company’s common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preferred securities will be redeemed upon repayment of the Debentures and
are callable by us on or after March 4, 2000, in whole or in part, initially at
103.5% of the liquidation preference per share, and thereafter at prices
declining at 0.5% per annum to 100% of the liquidation preference on and after
March 4, 2007 plus, in each case, accumulated, accrued and unpaid
distributions, if any, to the redemption date.

We have guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other
payments due on the preferred securities (the “Guarantee”). The Guarantee,
when taken together with our obligations under the Debentures, and in the
indenture pursuant to which the Debentures were issued, and our obligations
under the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust governing the subsidiary
trust, provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the
preferred securities.

Other Financing

We have a 364-day revolving credit agreement that allows for short-term
borrowings of up to $650.0 million (2003 – $550.0 million) which expires in
September 2004, and a $550.0 million three-year revolving credit facility which
expires in September 2005. These facilities are primarily intended to support
our commercial paper borrowings. We also have a $1.1 billion revolving
receivables sale facility, which expires in June 2004. At March 31, 2004,
there were no amounts utilized under any of these facilities.

In January 2002, we completed a public offering of $400.0 million of 7.75%
unsecured notes, due in 2012. These notes are redeemable at any time, in whole
or in part, at our option. Net proceeds of $397.3 million for the issuance of
these notes were used to repay term debt and for other general corporate
purposes.

The employee stock ownership program (“ESOP”) debt bears interest at rates
ranging from 8.6% fixed rate to approximately 89% of the London Interbank
Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) or LIBOR plus 0.4% and is due in semi-annual and annual
installments through 2009.

Our various borrowing facilities and certain long-term debt instruments
are subject to covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital
ratio, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt
outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $335.0 million of term debt
could be accelerated. At March 31, 2004, this ratio was 22.3% and we were in
compliance with all other covenants.

Aggregate annual payments on long-term debt, including capital lease
obligations, for the years ending March 31, are as follows: $274.8 million in
2005, $8.7 million in 2006, $27.2 million in 2007, $157.4 million in 2008, $8.0
million in 2009 and $1,008.5 million thereafter.

13. Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

At March 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, drafts and accounts payable,
and other liabilities approximated their estimated fair values because of the
short maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of our long-term debt were $1,484.6 million and $1,701.8
million at March 31, 2004 and $1,507.1 million and $1,678.0 million at March
31, 2003. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined based
on quoted market prices and may not be representative of actual values that
could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes
and foreign currency fluctuations. We limit these risks through the use of
derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward contracts. In accordance
with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes. We do not use
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

of base period amounts.

15. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

We maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension
plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees. In addition, we
provide postretirement benefits, consisting of healthcare and life insurance
benefits, for certain eligible employees.

U.S. Plans

Eligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company prior to December
31, 1996 are covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement
plan. In 1997, we amended this plan to freeze all plan benefits based on each
employee’s plan compensation and creditable service accrued to that date. No
annual contributions have been made by the Company since this plan was frozen.
The benefits for this defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on
age of employees at date of retirement, years of service and employees’ pay
during the five years prior to retirement. We also have nonqualified
supplemental defined benefit plans for certain U.S. executives, which are
non-funded. In addition to providing these retirement (“pension”) benefits, we
provide postretirement healthcare and life insurance (“other postretirement”)
benefits for certain eligible employees.

In April 2004, we made several lump sum cash payments totaling $41.6
million from an unfunded U.S. pension plan. In accordance with SFAS No. 88,
“Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit
Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,” approximately $13 million in
settlement charges associated with these payments will be expensed in the first
quarter of 2005.

Additional minimum liabilities were established to increase accrued
benefit cost, totaling $33.0 million and $30.5 million at March 31, 2004 and
2003 for our U.S. unfunded pension plans. The additional minimum liabilities
were partially offset by intangible assets of $5.9 million and $5.2 million and
charged to other comprehensive loss included in the consolidated stockholders’
equity, net of tax.

Projected benefit obligations relating to our unfunded U.S. pension plans
were $99.3 million and $85.3 million at March 31, 2004 and 2003. The Company
uses a December 31 measurement date for its U.S. pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. Pension costs are funded based on the
recommendations of independent actuaries and other postretirement benefits are
funded as claims are paid. We expect contributions for our U.S. pension plans
in 2005 to increase to approximately $46 million.

Expected benefit payments for our U.S. pension and other postretirement
plans are as follows:

We develop our expected long-term rate of return assumption based on the

asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices. Our
target asset allocation was determined based on the risk tolerance
characteristics of the plan and, at times, may be adjusted to achieve our
overall investment objective.

drugs, 15% and 11% for medical and 7% and 8% for dental in 2004 and 2003. The
assumed combined healthcare cost trend was 11% in 2002. The healthcare cost
trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. The

Other Defined Benefit Plans

Under various U.S. bargaining unit labor contracts, we make payments into
multi-employer pension plans established for union employees. We are liable
for a proportionate part of the plans’ unfunded vested benefits liabilities
upon our withdrawal from the plan, however information regarding the relative
position of each employer with respect to the actuarial present value of
accumulated benefits and net assets available for benefits is not available.
Contributions to the plans and amounts accrued were not material as of and for
the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible Canadian and
United Kingdom employees. At March 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of assets
for these plans amounted to $43.8 million and $30.8 million, and benefit
obligations amounted to $63.9 million and $45.4 million. For the years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, pension expense for these plans was $4.9
million, $3.1 million and $1.6 million.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have a contributory profit sharing investment plan (“PSIP”) for U.S.
employees not covered by collective bargaining arrangements. Eligible
employees may contribute up to 20% of their compensation to an individual
retirement savings account. The Company makes matching contributions equal to
or greater than 50% of employee contributions, not to exceed 3% of employee
compensation. An additional annual matching contribution may be



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

granted at the discretion of the Company. The Company provides for the
PSIP contributions with its common shares through its leveraged ESOP.

The ESOP has purchased an aggregate of 24.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock since its inception. These purchases have been financed
by 10 to 20-year loans from or guaranteed by us. The ESOP’s outstanding
borrowings are reported as long-term debt of the Company and the related
receivables from the ESOP are shown as a reduction of stockholders’ equity.
The loans are repaid by the ESOP from interest earnings on cash balances and
common dividends on shares not yet allocated to participants, common dividends
on certain allocated shares and Company cash contributions. The ESOP loan
maturities and rates are identical to the terms of related Company borrowings.
Stock is made available from the ESOP based on debt service payments on ESOP
borrowings.

Contribution expense for the PSIP in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was all ESOP
related. After-tax ESOP expense, including interest expense on ESOP debt, was
$7.8 million, $7.9 million and $9.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
Approximately 1.6 million, 1.7 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock
were allocated to plan participants in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Through March 31,
2004, 20.8 million common shares have been allocated to plan participants,
resulting in a balance of 3.5 million common shares in the ESOP which have not
yet been allocated to plan participants.

our foreign operations totaling $406.8 million were considered to be
permanently reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been recognized for the
remittance of such earnings to the U.S. since it is our intention to utilize
those earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research
and development activities for an indefinite period of time, or to repatriate
such earnings when it is tax efficient to do so. The determination of the
amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable since the
computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a
decision to repatriate the earnings is made.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

We have income tax net operating loss carryforwards related to our U.K.
operations of approximately $78 million, which have an indefinite life. We
also have state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$298 million which will expire at various dates from 2005 through 2024. We
believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these state net
operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this
risk, we have provided a full valuation allowance of $20.4 million on the
deferred tax assets relating to these state net operating loss carryforwards.
If this valuation allowance is reversed in the future, approximately $12
million of the tax benefit realized will be credited to equity.

17. Financial Guarantees and Warranties

Financial Guarantees

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions
under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of inventory (primarily for our
Canadian business) at a discount in the event these customers are unable to
meet certain obligations to those financial institutions. Among other
requirements, these inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also
guaranteed loans, credit facilities and the payment of leases for some
customers; and we are a secured lender for substantially all of these
guarantees. Customer guarantees range from one to ten years and were primarily
provided to facilitate financing for certain strategic customers. At March 31,
2004, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer
guarantees were $169.1 million and $57.9 million of which a nominal amount had
been accrued.

In 2004, a Pharmaceutical Solutions customer filed for bankruptcy.
Accordingly, we reviewed all amounts owed to us from this customer as well as
financial guarantees provided to third parties in favor of this customer, and
as a result, we increased our provision for doubtful accounts by $30.0 million.
On April 21, 2004, we converted a $40.0 million credit facility guarantee in
favor of this customer to a note receivable due from this customer. This
secured note bears interest and is repayable in 2007. In conjunction with this
modification, an inventory repurchase guarantee in favor of this customer for
approximately $12 million has been terminated.

At March 31, 2004, we had commitments of $12.4 million, primarily
consisting of the purchase of services from our equity-held investments, for
which no amounts had been accrued.

The expirations of the above noted financial guarantees and commitments
are as follows: $78.7 million, $27.7 million, $7.0 million, $1.9 million and
$1.6 million from 2005 through 2009, and $122.5 million thereafter.

In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $65.4 million
of standby letters of credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet
the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and
fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability
programs.

Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for
indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe on
a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred
any material costs as a result of such indemnification agreements and have not
accrued any liabilities related to such obligations.

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may
provide routine indemnification agreements (such as retention of previously
existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) whose terms vary in
duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, obligations
for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the amounts of
these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall
maximum amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than
obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have
historically not made significant payments as a result of these indemnification
provisions.

Warranties

In the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and
indemnification protection for our products and services. For example, we
provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products we
distribute are in compliance with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other
applicable laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our
suppliers, which customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

addition, we have indemnity obligations to our customers for these
products, which have also been provided to us from our suppliers, either
through express agreement or by operation of law.

We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and
automation products we sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring
the product into compliance with previously agreed upon specifications. For
software products, this may result in additional project costs which are
reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting for software installation services within these contracts. In
addition, most of our customers who purchase our software and automation
products also purchase annual maintenance agreements. Revenue from these
maintenance agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract
period and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when
claims become estimable. Accrued warranty costs were not material to the
consolidated balance sheets.

18. Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

I. Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by the Company in April, May and July of 1999 that
it had determined that certain software sales transactions in its Information
Solutions segment, formerly HBO & Company (“HBOC”) and now known as McKesson
Information Solutions, Inc., were improperly recorded as revenue and reversed,
as of March 31, 2004, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed against McKesson,
HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors,
and other defendants, including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. (“Bear Stearns”) and
Arthur Andersen LLP (“Arthur Andersen”).

Federal Actions

Sixty-seven of the above mentioned actions have been filed in Federal
Court (the “Federal Actions”). All of the undismissed Federal Actions are
pending before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District
Court (the “Court”) for the Northern District of California. Federal Actions
filed as class actions (excluding the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(commonly known as “ERISA”) actions discussed below) have been consolidated
into a single action before Judge Whyte under the caption

In re McKesson HBOC,
Inc. Securities Litigation

(Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the “Consolidated
Action”). As discussed below, some individual Federal Actions are also pending
before Judge Whyte. By order dated December 22, 1999, Judge Whyte appointed
the New York State Common Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff”)
in the Consolidated Action and approved Lead Plaintiff’s choice of counsel.

After the filing of three consolidated complaints and multiple motions by
multiple defendants challenging the sufficiency of those complaints, the
pleadings in the case have been set with respect to McKesson and HBOC (motions
for reconsideration of prior dismissal orders issued by Judge Whyte have been
filed by Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns and remain pending). The operative
complaint in the Consolidated Action is Lead Plaintiff’s Third Amended and
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“TAC”), filed on February 15, 2002. The
TAC asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) in connection with the
events leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May and July 1999, and
names McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns as defendants. The
Section 10(b) claim alleges that McKesson and HBOC intentionally misstated the
financial statements of HBOC or McKesson during the class period. The Section
14(a) claim alleges that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus issued in
connection with a McKesson subsidiary and HBOC merger (the “Merger”) contained
material misstatements or omissions and that McKesson was negligent in issuing
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with those misstatements. The TAC seeks
unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees.

By order dated January 6, 2003, Judge Whyte dismissed with prejudice the
claim against the Company under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act to the extent
that claim was based on McKesson’s conduct or statements prior to the January
12, 1999 merger transaction with HBOC, denied the Company’s motion to dismiss
the claim against the Company under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and
ordered the Company to answer the TAC. Following the Court’s January 6, 2003
orders, the following claims remained against McKesson and HBOC: (i) a claim
against HBOC under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act; (ii) a claim against
McKesson under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to post-Merger
conduct only; and (iii) a Section 14(a) claim against McKesson, as described in
the Court’s January 6, 2003 order. The Company and HBOC filed answers to the
TAC on March 7,

2003, denying that the Company or HBOC had violated Section 10(b) or
Section 14(a) or that they had any liability to the alleged plaintiff class.

On March 7, 2003, Lead Plaintiff filed a motion for class certification
seeking to certify a class consisting of (i) all persons and entities who
purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of HBOC during the
period from January 20, 1997, through and including January 12, 1999, (ii) all
persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded
securities or call options, or who sold put options, of McKesson during the
period from October 18, 1998 through and including April 27, 1999, and (iii)
all persons and entities who held McKesson common stock on November 27, 1998
and still held those shares on January 12, 1999. Lead Plaintiff seeks an order
appointing three representatives of this proposed class: (i) the Lead
Plaintiff; (ii) City of Miami Beach General Employees Retirement Trust; and
(iii) an individual investor named Donald Chiert. The hearing on class
certification was held on March 12, 2004. Judge Whyte has not yet ruled on the
motion for class certification. McKesson and HBOC have commenced the
production of documents in the Consolidated Action and, pursuant to pretrial
orders, merits depositions have begun. A trial is scheduled to commence on
September 12, 2005.

On January 11, 2001, McKesson filed an action in the Court for the
Northern District of California against the Lead Plaintiff in the Consolidated
Action individually, and as a representative of a defendant class of former
HBOC shareholders who exchanged HBOC shares for Company shares in the January
12, 1999 Merger,

McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State Common Retirement Fund,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. C01-20021 RMW) (the “Complaint and Counterclaim”). In
the Complaint and Counterclaim, the Company alleged that the exchanged HBOC
shares were artificially inflated due to undisclosed accounting improprieties,
and that the exchange ratio therefore provided more shares to former HBOC
shareholders than would have otherwise been the case. In this action, the
Company sought to recover the “unjust enrichment” received by those HBOC
shareholders who exchanged more than 20,000 HBOC shares in the Merger. The
Company did not allege any wrongdoing by these shareholders. On January 9,
2002, Judge Whyte dismissed the Complaint and Counterclaim with prejudice. The
Company appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”). On August 13, 2003, the Ninth Circuit
affirmed Judge Whyte’s January 9, 2002, order dismissing the Complaint and
Counterclaim.

By order dated February 7, 2000, Judge Whyte coordinated with the
Consolidated Action a class action alleging claims under ERISA,

Chang v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-00-20030 RMW), and a shareholder
derivative action that had been filed in the Northern District of California
under the caption

Cohen v. McCall et al.

(Case No. C-99-20916 RMW) with the
Consolidated Action. There has been no further significant activity in the
Cohen action. By stipulated order dated April 30, 2003, no defendant or
nominal defendant is required to respond to the complaint until notified by the
plaintiff in writing with thirty days notice or upon further order of the
Court. Recent developments in the Chang action are discussed below.

Several individual actions have also been filed in, or transferred to, the
Northern District of California. On November 12, 1999, an individual
shareholder action was filed in the Court for the Northern District of
California under the caption

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(C-99-21192
RMW). The Plaintiffs in Jacobs are former HBOC shareholders who acquired their
HBOC shares pursuant to a registration statement issued by HBOC prior to the
Merger, and then exchanged their HBOC shares for McKesson shares in the Merger.
Plaintiffs in Jacobs assert claims under federal and state securities laws and
a claim for common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages, and costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. Judge Whyte’s
December 22, 1999, order consolidated the Jacobs action with the Consolidated
Action. With leave of the Court, the Jacobs plaintiffs amended their
complaint, but the action remains stayed. On September 21, 2000 the plaintiffs
in

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

filed a new individual action entitled

Jacobs
v. HBO & Company

(Case No. C-00-20974 RMW). The Jacobs complaint names only
HBOC as a defendant and asserts claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the
Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and various state law causes
of action. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages,
and costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. This action has been assigned to
Judge Whyte and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On December 16, 1999, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Bea v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al

. (Case No. C-00-20072 RMW). Plaintiffs in Bea filed an Amended Complaint
on March 9, 2000. Plaintiffs in Bea allege that they acquired the Company’s
common stock prior to the Merger and sold that stock after the April 1999
announcement at a loss. The Bea complaint asserts claims under the federal and
state securities laws, and a claim for fraud. Plaintiffs seek (i) unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, and (ii) reasonable costs and expenses of
suit, including attorneys’ fees. Bea is currently stayed and has been
consolidated with the Consolidated Action.



McKESSON CORPORATION

On January 7, 2000, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Cater v. McKesson Corporation
et al.

(Case No. C-00-20327 RMW). The plaintiff is Terry Cater, a former
employee of the Company who alleges that his options and restricted stock were
substantially devalued as a result of the Merger and the subsequent drop in the
Company’s stock price. Plaintiff in Cater asserts claims under the federal
securities laws as well as claims for breach of good faith and fair dealing,
fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Plaintiff seeks (i) unspecified special
damages in excess of $50,000, (ii) unspecified general damages, (iii)
prejudgment interest and (iv) reasonable attorneys’ fees. The case has been
assigned to Judge Whyte and the parties stipulated to a stay pending the
outcome of the motions to dismiss in the Consolidated Action.

On February 7, 2000, an action entitled

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al.

(Case No. CV 00-0188) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Louisiana. The same plaintiffs then filed a virtually identical
parallel action in Louisiana State Court, Rapides Parish, under the caption

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al

(filed as Case No. 199018; Case No.
CV-00-0522 after removal to federal court). Plaintiffs, former shareholders of
Automated Prescription Services, allege claims under the federal securities
laws, and claims for breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and
detrimental reliance. The state court action was removed to federal court and
the two Baker cases have been transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On June 17, 2003, plaintiffs in the Baker cases filed a Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”) against McKesson, HBOC, various current or former officers or
directors of McKesson or HBOC, Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns. The SAC
asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under Section 14(a) of the Exchange
Act, for common law breach of fiduciary duty (McKesson only),
misrepresentation, and detrimental reliance. The SAC seeks damages in an
unspecified amount. By stipulation of the parties and order of the Court, the
Baker action is stayed and the defendants are not currently required to respond
to the SAC.

On July 27, 2001, an action was filed in the Court for the Northern
District of California captioned

Pacha, et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(Case No. C01-20713 PVT). The Pacha plaintiffs allege that they were
individual stockholders of McKesson stock on November 27, 1998, and assert that
McKesson and HBOC violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and that
McKesson, aided by HBOC, breached its fiduciary duties to plaintiffs by issuing
a joint proxy statement in connection with the Merger which allegedly contained
false and misleading statements or omissions. Plaintiffs name as defendants
McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of McKesson or
HBOC, Bear Stearns and Arthur Andersen. The Pacha complaint seeks an award of
compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount and costs and
expenses incurred in the action including reasonable attorneys’ fees. On
November 13, 2001, Judge Whyte ordered Pacha consolidated with the Consolidated
Action and stayed all further proceedings.

Hess v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, an action filed in state court in
Arizona (Case No. C-20003862) on behalf of former shareholders of Ephrata
Diamond Spring Water Company (“Ephrata”) who acquired McKesson shares in
exchange for their Ephrata stock when McKesson acquired Ephrata in January
1999, was removed to federal court, transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action. Judge Whyte also
stayed all further proceedings in Hess except for the filing of an amended
complaint, which was filed on or about December 15, 2001 (the “Hess Amended
Complaint”). The Hess Amended Complaint generally incorporates the allegations
and claims asserted in the Consolidated Action and also includes various common
law causes of action relating to McKesson’s acquisition of Ephrata. The Hess
Amended Complaint seeks compensatory, punitive, general and special damages in
an unspecified amount, rescission of the agreement with Ephrata, attorneys’
fees and costs. The Company is not currently required to respond to the Hess
Amended Complaint.

On June 28, 2001, the Chang plaintiffs filed an amended ERISA class action
complaint against McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or
directors of McKesson or HBOC, and The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”). The
amended complaint in Chang generally alleged that the defendants breached their
ERISA fiduciary duties in connection with administering the McKesson HBOC
Profit Sharing Investment Plan (the “PSI Plan”) and the HBOC Profit Sharing and
Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”). Plaintiffs in Chang are former employees of
McKesson and participants in the PSI Plan, and purportedly seek relief under
sections 404-405, 409 and 502 of ERISA on behalf of a class defined to include
participants in the PSI Plan, including participants under the HBOC
Plan, who maintained an account balance under the PSI Plan as of April 27,
1999, who had not received a distribution from the PSI Plan as of April 27,
1999, and who suffered losses as a result of the alleged breaches of duty.



McKESSON CORPORATION

On February 7, 2002, a related ERISA class action was filed in the Court
for the Northern District of California captioned

Adams v. McKesson Information
Solutions, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-02-06 85 JCS). Plaintiff in Adams filed a
first amended complaint on March 15, 2002, against HBOC, McKesson, the HBO &
Company Board of Directors, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Administrative Committee, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Investment Committee, McKesson HBOC, Inc. Profit Sharing Investment Plan (as a
nominal defendant only), and certain current or former officers, directors or
employees of McKesson or HBOC. Plaintiff alleges that he was a participant in
the HBOC Plan and generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC breached their ERISA
fiduciary duties to the HBOC Plan and its participants or engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiff asserts his claims on behalf of a
putative class defined to include all participants in the HBOC Plan and their
beneficiaries for whose benefit the HBOC Plan acquired HBOC stock from March
31, 1996 to April 1, 1999. Plaintiff seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and
HBOC breached their fiduciary duties, (ii) an order requiring defendants to
restore to the plan all losses caused by these purported breaches of fiduciary
duty, and (iii) reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses.

On June 3, 2002, Judge Whyte consolidated the Adams ERISA class action
with the Chang ERISA class action. By order dated September 30, 2002 Judge
Whyte dismissed the First Amended Complaint in the Chang action. Judge Whyte
granted plaintiffs in Chang and Adams leave to file a consolidated and amended
complaint under the caption

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. ERISA Litigation

(Northern District of California No. C-02-0685 RMW) (the “ERISA Action”). On
December 31, 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint (the
“CAC”) in the ERISA Action. The CAC generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC
breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA, and that HBOC engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiffs further allege that McKesson and
HBOC are liable under principles of

respondeat superior

and agency for alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties by other defendants. The CAC seeks to have the
defendants restore to the HBOC Plan and McKesson Plan losses allegedly caused
by their alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees,
costs and expenses. On February 28, 2003, McKesson filed a motion to dismiss
the CAC and HBOC filed motions to dismiss portions of the CAC. Judge Whyte has
not yet issued a ruling on these motions.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have also been filed in various state courts in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State
Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State Actions generally allege
misconduct by McKesson or HBOC (and others) in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements.

Two of the State Actions are shareholder derivative actions:

Ash, et al.
v. McCall, et al.

, (Case No. 17132), filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and

Mitchell v. McCall et al.

(Case. No. 304415), filed in California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco. McKesson is named as a nominal
defendant only as no relief is sought against it in these actions. Plaintiffs
in Mitchell agreed to defer any action by the court on McKesson’s motions
pending resolution of McKesson’s dismissal motion in Ash. On September 15,
2000, in the Ash case, the Court of Chancery dismissed all causes of action
with leave to re-plead certain of the dismissed claims, and on January 22,
2001, the Ash plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint. On October 30, 2003,
the Court granted the plaintiffs leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint and
changed the caption of the case to

Saito, et. al. v. McCall

(Civil Action No.
17132). On December 15, 2003, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the
Fourth Amended Complaint. A hearing has been scheduled for May 18, 2004, to
consider the defendants’ motions to dismiss.

Five of the State Actions are class actions. Three of these were filed in
the Delaware Court of Chancery:

Derdiger v. Tallman et al.

(Civil Action No.
17276),

Carroll v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 17454) and

Kelly v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Civil Action No. 17282). Two additional actions
were filed in the Delaware Superior Court:

Edmondson v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 99-951) and

Caravetta v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action
No. 00C-04-214 WTQ). The Carroll and Kelly actions have been voluntarily
dismissed without prejudice. McKesson removed Edmondson to federal court in
Delaware and filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the federal court
on March 5, 2002. McKesson filed motions to stay the Derdiger and Caravetta
actions in favor of proceedings in the federal Consolidated Action, which were
granted. On December 20, 2001, the plaintiff in Derdiger moved to vacate the
stay of that action. In a series of rulings dated September 9, 2002, October
11, 2002 and October 18, 2002, the court denied plaintiff’s motion to vacate
the stay with respect to any class claims but granted plaintiff leave to
proceed with his individual claims. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion
for partial summary judgment, and the former directors of Access Health, Inc., who are
also defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the claims asserted against them.
The parties have asked the court to defer consideration of those motions



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

while they pursue settlement discussions. On August 4, 2003, the court issued
an order dismissing the class action claims brought on behalf of persons other
than the named plaintiff Howard Derdiger without prejudice in favor of the
prior pending Consolidated Action pending in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California. The parties thereafter dismissed plaintiff
Howard Derdiger’s individual claims with prejudice pursuant to a settlement.

Several of the State Actions are individual actions which have been filed
in various state courts. Five of these were filed in the California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco:

Yurick v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 303857),

The State of Oregon by and through the Oregon Public
Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 307619),

Utah State Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 311269),

Minnesota State Board of Investment v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
311747), and

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. CGC-02-405792). Oregon, Utah, and Minnesota and Merrill
Lynch have been consolidated before the Honorable Donald S. Mitchell under the
Oregon caption.

In Yurick, the trial court sustained McKesson’s demurrer to the original
complaint without leave to amend with respect to all causes of action except
plaintiffs’ claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation, which
remain in the case. The complaint in Yurick seeks compensatory, general,
special, punitive and consequential damages in an unspecified amount,
prejudgment interest, costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. On December 27,
2002, the Yurick action was assigned to Judge Mitchell, the presiding judge in
the Oregon, Minnesota, Utah and Merrill Lynch actions.

The Oregon, Utah and Minnesota actions referenced above are individual
securities actions filed in the California Superior Court for the City and
County of San Francisco by the out-of-state pension funds for each of those
States and Colorado. On October 16, 2002, after motion practice to challenge
the sufficiency of the complaints in Utah, Minnesota and Oregon, which resulted
in the dismissal of a number of claims that had been asserted against McKesson
and HBOC, and the consolidation of those actions under the caption

The State of
Oregon Public Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Master
File No. 307619), plaintiffs in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah filed a consolidated
and amended complaint (the “CAAC”) which consolidated the remaining claims in
those actions. On October 11, 2002, plaintiffs in Merrill Lynch filed an
amended complaint in the Merrill Lynch action.

On March 13, 2003, Judge Mitchell overruled McKesson’s and HBOC’s
demurrers to and motions to strike the CAAC in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah. On
the same date, Judge Mitchell sustained in part and overruled in part
McKesson’s and HBOC’s demurrers, and denied McKesson’s and HBOC’s motions to
strike the amended complaint in Merrill Lynch. Following those orders, the
following claims remain against McKesson and HBOC in the consolidated Oregon
action: (i) under California law, for violation of California Corporations Code
§ 25000/25400, for violation of California Business and Professions Code §
17200 (against HBOC only), and for common law fraud and negligent
misrepresentation, and (ii) under Georgia law, claims for conspiracy under
Georgia’s RICO statute, and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The CAAC seeks compensatory, general,
punitive and special damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest and
reasonable attorneys’ fees. Following the Court’s March 13, 2003, orders and
the Court’s June 18, 2003, order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for
reconsideration, the following claims remain against McKesson and HBOC in the
Merrill Lynch action: (i) under California law, for violation of California
Corporations Code § 25000/25400, for violation of California Business and
Professions Code § 17200 (against HBOC only), and for common law fraud,
negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy and aiding and abetting, (ii) under New
Jersey law, for violation of New Jersey’s RICO statute and conspiracy to
violate New Jersey’s RICO statute, and (iii) under Georgia law, for violation
of Georgia’s securities laws and violation of Georgia’s RICO statutes.

On June 27, 2003, plaintiffs in the Merrill Lynch action filed a Third
Amended Complaint (the “TAAC”) against McKesson, HBOC, various current or
former officers or directors of McKesson or HBOC, and Arthur Andersen. Like
the prior complaints in the Merrill Lynch action, the TAAC generally alleges
that the defendants are liable under various statutory and common law claims in
connection with the events leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May
and July of 1999. The TAAC asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under
California Corporations Code § 25400(d)/25500, California Business and
Profession Code § 17200 (HBOC only), common law fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, conspiracy and aiding and abetting, New Jersey RICO
(McKesson only), conspiracy to violate New Jersey RICO, Georgia’s securities
laws, and conspiracy to violate Georgia RICO.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The TAAC seeks an award of restitution, compensatory damages and treble
damages in an unspecified amount, and costs and expenses of litigation,
including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees.

On July 25, 2003, McKesson and HBOC answered the Consolidated Complaint in
Oregon, Minnesota and Utah, generally denying the allegations and any liability
to plaintiffs. Also on July 25, 2003, McKesson filed cross-claims against all
plaintiffs named in the Consolidated Complaint, alleging that if such parties
exchanged HBOC shares in the Merger that were artificially inflated, as alleged
by those parties in the Consolidated Complaint, then the exchange ratio for the
Merger provided more shares to plaintiffs than would have otherwise been the
case, and more shares than was just. The Company’s cross-claims against the
plaintiffs seek judgments requiring plaintiffs to disgorge to the Company any
“unjust enrichment.” On January 9, 2004, the court heard arguments on
plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss McKesson’s cross-claims. The court has not yet
issued a ruling on that motion.

On September 26, 2003 the Merrill Lynch Plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended
Complaint (the “FAC”). The FAC adds Bear Stearns, General Electric Capital
Corporation, Inc. (“GECC”), Computer Associates International, Inc. (“CAI”),
and WebMD Corp. (“WebMD”) as defendants. The claims against GECC allege that
GECC aided and abetted the alleged fraud at HBOC, conspired to commit fraud and
made negligent misrepresentations. On December 30, 2003, McKesson and HBOC
answered the FAC, generally denying the allegations and any liability to
plaintiffs. Judge Mitchell has scheduled a trial date of November 28, 2005, in
the consolidated Oregon, Minnesota, Utah and Merrill Lynch actions.

Several individual actions have been filed in various state courts outside
of California. Several of these cases have been filed in Georgia state courts.
On October 24, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Suffolk Partners Limited Partnership et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 00VS010469A). Plaintiffs in the Suffolk action allegedly
purchased the Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999
announcement. Plaintiffs assert claims under Georgia’s securities and
racketeering laws, and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The Suffolk action names as defendants
the Company, HBOC, and certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, and Arthur Andersen. Like the Consolidated Action, the
claims in the Suffolk action generally arise out of the January 12, 1999
Merger, and the Company’s announcement of the need to restate its financial
statements. Plaintiffs seek (i) compensatory damages of approximately $22
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Company and HBOC separately answered the complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Suffolk
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. On August 2,
2001, the Court granted the motions to stay. Subsequently, however, in May
2003, the Court lifted the stay and directed the parties to coordinate
discovery with that in the Consolidated Action and several other actions.
Following the lifting of the stay, all Defendants filed motions to dismiss on
various grounds, all of which were denied, except as to Defendant Pulido, whom
Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed. Discovery is now proceeding in coordination
with the Consolidated Action.

On November 1, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
00 VS 010801). Plaintiff in the Curran action allegedly purchased the
Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999 announcement.
The claims in the Curran action are identical to the claims in the Suffolk
action. Plaintiff seeks (i) compensatory damages of approximately $3 million,
as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with respect
to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Curran action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, and
certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and
Arthur Andersen. The Company and HBOC separately answered the Complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Curran
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. The Court
granted the motions to stay on August 22, 2001. However, in September 2003,
the court lifted the stay and transferred the action to the judge presiding
over the previously-reported action captioned

Suffolk Partners L.P. et al v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

, (Georgia State Court, Fulton County No.
00VS010469A). Discovery is now proceeding in coordination with the
Consolidated Action.

On December 12, 2001, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Drake v. McKesson Corp., et al.

(Case No. 01VS026303A).
Plaintiff in Drake is a former HBOC employee seeking lost commissions as well as asserting claims under Georgia’s securities and
racketeering laws, and various common law causes of action. Plaintiff seeks
(i) approximately $300,000 in unpaid commissions, (ii) unspecified
compensatory,

consequential, actual, exemplary, and punitive damages, and (iii) prejudgment
and post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’
fees. The Drake action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi
and Jay Gilbertson. The parties entered into a Consent Order for Partial Stay
on February 27, 2002, which stayed Plaintiff’s Georgia securities law, fraud
and RICO claims. On March 4, 2002, McKesson and McKesson Information Solutions
Inc. separately filed their answers. Following discovery, the case was settled
and Plaintiff filed a dismissal with prejudice on March 5, 2004.

Two similar Georgia actions have been consolidated for purposes of
discovery and may be consolidated for purposes of trial. On January 31, 2002,
an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton County, under the caption

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v. McKesson, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
2002-CV-48407). Plaintiffs in the Green action are former HBOC shareholders.
Plaintiff Holcombe Green was also a former officer, chairman and director of
HBOC. On February 6, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court,
Fulton County, under the caption

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 2002-CV-48612). Plaintiff in the Hall action is a former
HBOC shareholder. One of the limited partners of the Hall Plaintiff is Nancy
Hall Green, the wife of Holcombe Green. The complaints in the Green and Hall
actions are substantially identical. In each action, Plaintiffs asserted
claims for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance and named as defendants
the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. In each action,
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $100 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’ fees. The Company and HBOC filed their respective answers and
counterclaims on April 22, 2002. HBOC also filed a third party complaint
against Holcombe Green for indemnification. The Company and HBOC also filed
motions to stay and dismiss. The Court denied the motions to stay, and
partially granted the motions to dismiss, dismissing Plaintiffs’ claims for
fraudulent conveyance. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaims filed by
the Company and HBOC, and the Court denied those motions. Discovery is under
way and will proceed for some time. The trial court granted Plaintiffs’ motion
to compel the production of certain work product materials, and the Georgia
Court of Appeals affirmed. The Company has filed a petition for discretionary
review in the Georgia Supreme Court, and Plaintiffs have filed an opposition to
that petition.

On May 8, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton County,
under the caption

James Gilbert v. McKesson Corporation, et al.

(Case No.
02VS032502C). Plaintiff, formerly the general counsel of HBOC, alleges he was
a holder of options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock. The action
names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson.
Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages of approximately $2 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’ fees. On June 24, 2002, the Company and HBOC filed their respective
answers, motions to stay, and motions to dismiss. On November 26, 2002, the
court granted the motions to stay, and this case is stayed until final
disposition of the Consolidated Action.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of
California (“USAO”) and the SEC are conducting investigations into the matters
leading to the restatement. On May 15, 2000, the USAO filed a one-count
information against former HBOC officer, Dominick DeRosa, charging Mr. DeRosa
with aiding and abetting securities fraud, and on May 15, 2000, Mr. DeRosa
entered a guilty plea to that charge. On September 28, 2000, an indictment was
unsealed in the Northern District of California against former HBOC officer,
Jay P. Gilbertson, and former Company and HBOC officer, Albert J. Bergonzi,

United States v. Bergonzi, et al.

(Case No. CR-00-0505). On that same date, a
civil complaint was filed by the SEC against Mr. Gilbertson, Mr. Bergonzi and
Mr. DeRosa

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gilbertson, et al.

(Case No.
C-00-3570). Mr. DeRosa has settled with the SEC without admitting or denying
the substantive allegations of the complaint. On January 10, 2001, the grand
jury returned a superseding indictment in the Northern District of California
against Messrs. Gilbertson and Bergonzi,

United States v. Bergonzi, et al.

(Case No. CR-00-0505), and on June 4, 2003, a second superseding indictment was
unsealed which added new charges against Mr. Bergonzi and which also charged
both former Chairman of the Board of HBOC and the Company, Charles W. McCall,
and former HBOC General Counsel, Jay Lapine, with various securities law
violations. Also on June 4, 2003, the USAO announced the filing of agreements
with Messrs. Gilbertson, DeRosa and former HBOC Senior Vice President for
Finance, Timothy Heyerdahl, to plead guilty to various securities law
violations (Case Nos. CR-00-0505, CR-00-0213 and CR-01-0002, respectively).
The USAO has informed the Company that it is not now nor has it ever been a
subject or target of the USAO’s investigation.

On September 27, 2001, the SEC filed securities fraud charges against six
former HBOC officers and employees including Messrs. Heyerdahl and Lapine.
Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission’s civil complaints, four of the six defendants settled the claims brought against
them by, among other things, consenting, without admitting or denying the
allegations of the complaints, to entry of permanent injunctions against all of
the



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

alleged violations, and agreed to pay civil penalties in various amounts. On
June 4, 2003, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Mr. McCall for various
securities law violations (Case No. C-03-2603). On January 3, 2002, the
Company was notified in writing by the SEC that its investigation has been
terminated as to the Company, and that no enforcement action has been
recommended to the Commission.

On April 24, 2003, Gilbertson entered into a written plea agreement with
the USAO in which he pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and
making false statements in a document filed with the SEC. On October 16, 2003,
Bergonzi entered into a written plea agreement with the USAO in which he pled
guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. On March
30, 2004, the USAO filed a three count indictment against former McKesson
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Richard H. Hawkins,
charging him with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, securities
fraud, and making false statements to an accountant. On March 31, 2004, Mr.
Hawkins pled not guilty to the charges.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings, or to estimate the amounts
of, or potential range of, loss with respect to those proceedings. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain.
The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments
against the Company or settlements that could require substantial payments by
the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigation and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for product liability and other damages, investigations relating to
governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal
conduct of our business. These include:

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., is one of many defendants
in approximately 24 cases in which plaintiffs claim they were injured due to
exposure, over many years, to latex proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous
manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors, including McKesson
Medical-Surgical Inc. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its suppliers
are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers.
McKesson Medical Surgical Inc.’s insurers are providing some coverage for
these cases, subject to applicable deductibles.

We, along with more than 100 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit
brought in 2000 by the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (the
“Foundation”) alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven (7)
U.S. patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for
the automated management and control of product inventory, warehousing,
distribution and point-of-sale transactions. Due to the pendency of earlier
litigation brought against the Foundation by the manufacturers of bar code
devices attacking the validity of the patents at issue, the court stayed the
suit against us until the conclusion of the earlier case, including any appeals
that may be taken. The trial in this earlier case concluded in January 2003
and the court subsequently ruled that each of the patents at issue was invalid
due to prosecutorial laches. An appeal by the Foundation to the Federal
Circuit Court of Appeals is anticipated. While the suit against the Company
was stayed, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petitions for
reexamination of three of the seven patents asserted by the Foundation against
the Company. The reexamination will determine, among other things, whether
these patents have expired. Each of the remaining four patents in the action
has already expired by its own terms, or by the Foundation disclaiming the
remaining portion of the patent’s life.

We, through our former McKesson Chemical Company division, are named in
approximately 66 cases involving the alleged distribution of asbestos. These
cases typically involve multiple plaintiffs claiming personal injuries and
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement signed
at the time of the 1986 sale of McKesson Chemical Company to what is now called
Univar USA Inc. (“Univar”), we have tendered each of these actions to Univar.
Univar is currently defending us but has raised questions concerning the extent
of its obligations under the indemnification agreement. Discussions with Univar on that subject are
ongoing. We have not paid or incurred any costs or expenses in connection with
these actions to date; and we continue to look to Univar for defense and full



McKESSON CORPORATION

indemnification of these claims. In addition, we believe that, if necessary, a
portion of these claims would be covered by insurance.

On January 21, 2004, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation
(“AmerisourceBergen”) filed a bid protest and a request for injunctive relief,

AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation vs. U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs

(Action No. 04-00063), in the United States Court of Federal Claims in
connection with the December 31, 2003 award by the United States Department of
Veteran Affairs (the “VA”) of Prime Vendor status to the Company for the supply
of pharmaceutical products to the VA commencing April 1, 2004. We successfully
moved to intervene in this action. On February 9, 2004, the parties stipulated
and the Court ordered a delay in the commencement date of the VA contract to a
date 45 days following the Court’s decision on the merits of the
AmerisourceBergen protest. On March 31, 2004, the Court issued its decision
rejecting AmerisourceBergen’s bid protest and ordering the dismissal of the
complaint. Pursuant to the terms of the Court’s February 9

th

order, the
Company’s performance under the Prime Vendor contract commenced on May 10,
2004.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois (“USAOI”)
is conducting an industry-wide civil and criminal investigation into the
marketing, sale and Medicare reimbursement of enteral nutritional products
(“Products”). The Products are sold by the extended care business conducted by
our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Minnesota Inc. (“Minnesota Supply”).
The USAOI has indicated that the Company and two employees of Minnesota Supply
are subjects of the investigation. In July of 2003, the USAOI announced
indictments of the two employees on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy, and
violation of the anti-kickback statute. The employees were subsequently placed
on leave pending resolution of the charges. We continue to cooperate with the
investigation.

On May 4, 2004, a judgment was entered against the Company in

Charlene
Roby vs. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al, (

Action No. CV01-573), pending in the
Superior Court of Yolo County, California on claims by a former employee for
wrongful termination, disability discrimination and harassment and against a
Company employee defendant on the harassment claim only. The jury awarded
plaintiff $3.5 million in compensatory damages against the Company and $0.5
million in compensatory damages against the individual employee. Punitive
damages of $15.0 million were assessed against the Company. The Company will
seek reduction or reversal of this judgment through post-trial motions, and
through an appeal, if necessary. If these efforts are not successful, this
judgment could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses,
which were fully divested by 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant
to environmental laws and regulations. We have received claims and demands
from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action
purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at
six sites where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations;
and we, by administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain
actions at those sites, including soil and groundwater remediation. In
addition, we were recently one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United
States Environmental Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural
resources damages (“NRD”) associated with one of these six sites. Although the
Company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at
this time, we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) group in the funding of an NRD assessment, the costs of which are
reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with
outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of
reasonably possible remediation costs for these six sites is $12.9 million, net
of approximately $2 million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement
or we expect, based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions which
are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties. The $12.9 million is expected
to be paid out between April 2004 and March of 2028. Our liability for these
environmental matters has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a PRP under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the
“Superfund” law or its state law equivalent) for environmental assessment and
cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of hazardous substances at
26 sites. With respect to each of these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly
been designated and, while the current state of the law potentially imposes
joint and several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these
sites are



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

typically shared with other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 26 sites is
approximately $2 million. The aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in
Superfund matters to date have not been significant. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain
due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup
costs; the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs
are recoverable from insurance or other parties.

While it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome
of any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this
section II, “Other Litigation and Claims”, we believe based on current
knowledge and the advice of our counsel that, except as otherwise noted, such
litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

III. Contingency

In 2002, we entered into a $500 million, ten year contract with the
National Health Services Information Authority (“NHS”), an organization of the
British government charged with the responsibility of delivering healthcare in
England and Wales. The contract engages the Company to develop, implement and
operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 NHS locations.

To date, there have been delays to this contract which have caused
increased costs and a decrease in the amount of time in which we can earn
revenues. These delays have adversely impacted the contract’s projected
profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this contract.
As of March 31, 2004, our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of
approximately $76 million in net assets, consisting of prepaid expenses,
software and capital assets, net of cash received, related to this contract.
While we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate a satisfactory
system and recover our investment in this contract, we are currently
negotiating with the NHS to amend certain key terms and conditions in the
contract, and there is no certainty that we will agree on an updated
implementation plan. We expect this negotiation to be completed in the second
half of calendar year 2004. However, the timing and the outcome of these
negotiations is uncertain and failure to reach agreement on an updated
implementation plan and amend certain key contract terms and conditions, and/or
further delays in the implementation may result in losses that could be
material. Even if we agree on amended contract terms and conditions and an
updated implementation plan, it is possible that the terms of that agreement
may result in the impairment of our net assets related to the contract as well
as substantial penalties and charges, which could have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

19. Stockholders’ Equity

Each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock is permitted one vote
on proposals presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any
dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”). In July
2002, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Restated Articles of
Incorporation to increase authorized common shares from 400 million to 800
million shares.

In 2001, the Board approved a plan to repurchase up to $250.0 million of
common stock of the Company in open market or private transactions. In 2004,
2003 and 2002, we repurchased 3.9 million, 0.9 million and 1.3 million shares
for $115.1 million, $25.0 million and $44.2 million. Since the inception of
this plan, we repurchased 8.3 million shares for $249.9 million. In 2004, the
Board approved a new plan to repurchase up to $250.0 million of additional
common stock of the Company. Under this plan, we have repurchased 1.4 million
shares for $41.5 million in 2004. The repurchased shares will be used to
support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other
general corporate purposes.

We have several equity compensation plans (stock option, restricted stock
and stock purchase plans) for the benefit of certain officers, directors and
employees. As a result of acquisitions, we also have 18 other option plans
under which no further awards have been made since the date of acquisition.
Under the active equity compensation plans, we were authorized to grant up to
117.3 million shares as of March 31, 2004, of which 94.1 million shares have
been granted.

options vest over four years, subject to continuous employment and certain
other conditions. Options generally expire ten years after the grant date. In
2004, we accelerated the vesting of substantially all unvested stock options
outstanding with prices equal to or greater than $28.20, or substantially all
of the total unvested stock options outstanding.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

20. Related Party Balances and Transactions

Notes receivable outstanding from certain of our current and former
officers and senior managers totaled $62.7 million and $95.1 million at March
31, 2004 and 2003. These notes related to purchases of common stock under our
various employee stock purchase plans. The notes bear interest at rates
ranging from 2.7% to 8.0% and were due at various dates through February 2004.
Interest income on these notes is recognized only to the extent that cash is
received. These notes, which are included in other capital in the consolidated
balance sheets, were issued for amounts equal to the market value of the stock
on the date of the purchase and are full recourse to the borrower. At March
31, 2004, the value of the underlying stock collateral was $30.4 million. The
collectability of these notes is evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as a
result, in 2004 we recorded a $21.0 million charge for notes from the former
officers and employees. Other receivable balances held with related parties,
consisting of loans made to certain officers and senior managers, at March 31,
2004 and 2003 amounted to $2.6 million and $3.7 million.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002 we incurred approximately $8 million, $9 million
and $8 million of rental expense from an equity-held investment. In addition,
in 2004 and 2003 we purchased $3.0 million of services per year from an
equity-held investment.

21. Segments of Business

Our segments include Pharmaceutical Solutions, Medical-Surgical Solutions
and Information Solutions. We evaluate the performance of our operating
segments based on operating profit before interest expense, income taxes and
results from discontinued operations. Our Corporate segment includes expenses
associated with Corporate functions and projects, certain employee benefits,
and the results of certain joint venture investments. Corporate expenses are
allocated to the operating segments to the extent that these items can be
directly attributable to the segment.

In addition to the distribution of pharmaceutical and healthcare
products, our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment includes the manufacture
and sale of automated pharmaceutical dispensing systems for hospitals and
retail pharmacies, medical management and patient and payor services,
consulting and outsourcing to pharmacies and distribution of first-aid
products. Revenues from these products and services were not a material
component of segment revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

(2)

Includes $7.4 million, $12.2 million and $6.3 million of earnings from
equity investments in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

(3)

Includes amortization of intangibles, capitalized software held for sale
and capitalized software for internal use.

(4)

Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment.

In 2004, we received $21.7 million as our share of a settlement of an
antitrust class action brought against the manufacturer of a cardiac drug.
This settlement was recorded as a credit in cost of sales within our
consolidated statements of operations in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.

In April 2004, we reorganized certain businesses into different operating
segments. As a result, we will report on this new organizational structure on
a retroactive basis beginning in the first quarter of 2005.
