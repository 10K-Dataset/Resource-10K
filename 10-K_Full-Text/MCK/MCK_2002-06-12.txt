supplies, equipment, logistics and related services to healthcare providers
that include hospitals, physicians’ offices, extended care, and
homecare sites. The
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment is the nation’s third largest distributor of

system, Supply Management On-Line

SM

, provides an advanced way of ordering
medical-surgical products over the Internet, and its Optipak® program allows
physicians to customize ordering of supplies according to individual surgical
procedure preferences.

Information Solutions

Our Information
Solutions segment provides a comprehensive portfolio of software, support and services to help healthcare
organizations improve patient safety, reduce the cost and variability of care,
and better manage their resources and revenue stream. The Information
Solutions segment markets its products and services to integrated delivery
networks, hospitals, physician group practices, home health providers, managed
care providers and payors. Sixty-one percent of hospital-based integrated
delivery networks use one or more products from this segment. The segment also
sells its solutions internationally through subsidiaries and/or distribution
agreements in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, France, the
Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Australia and New Zealand. This business
segment has sales offices in the United Kingdom and Europe and a software
manufacturing facility in Ireland.

The product portfolio for the Information Solutions segment is organized
into three major solutions sets — clinical management, revenue cycle management
and resource management, with a variety of subsets of these solutions designed
to address specific healthcare business issues (e.g., physician access,
medication safety and homecare agency needs). To ensure that organizations
achieve the maximum value of their information technology investment, the
Information Solutions segment also offers a variety of services to support the
implementation and use of solutions as well as assist with business and
clinical redesign, process re-engineering and staffing (both information
technology and back office).

Clinical Management.

The segment’s clinical solutions are designed to
enable organizations to improve medication safety, accelerate physician
acceptance of information technology and reduce variability in healthcare
quality and costs. The clinical management solution set, known as Horizon
Clinicals™, is built using architecture to facilitate integration and enable
modular deployment of systems. It includes a clinical data repository,
document imaging, real-time decision support, point-of-care nursing
documentation, enterprise laboratory and pharmacy, an emergency department
solution and an ambulatory medical record. Horizon Clinicals™ also includes
solutions to facilitate physician access to patient information such as
Web-based physician portals and wireless devices that draw on information from
the hospital’s information systems.

Revenue Cycle Management.

The segment’s revenue cycle solution sets is
designed to reduce days in accounts receivable, facilitate insurance claim
processing, reduce costs and improve productivity. Examples of solutions sets
include contract management, electronic claims processing and coding compliance
checking. The segment’s hospital information systems also play a key role in
revenue cycle management by working with these solutions to automate the
operation of individual departments and their respective functions within the
inpatient environment.

Resource Management.

The segment’s resource management solution consists
of an integrated suite of applications that enhance an organization’s ability
to forecast and optimize the enterprise-wide use of resources (labor, supplies,
equipment and facilities) associated with the delivery of care. The solution
helps automate and link resource requirements to care protocols, resulting in
increased profitability, enhanced decision-making, and improved business
processes.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Technology Services.

The group works with healthcare organizations to
support the operation of their information systems by providing the technical
infrastructure designed to maximize application accessibility, availability,
security and performance.

Professional Services

. Professional services help customers achieve
business results from their software investment through a wide array of quality
service options including consulting for business process improvement and
re-design, as well as implementation, project management, technical, and
education services relating to all products in the Information Solutions
segment.

Outsourcing Services

. The Information Solutions segment has been in the
business of helping healthcare organizations focus their resources where they
are needed while the segment manages their information technology or revenue
cycle operations through outsourcing. Outsourcing service options include
managing hospital data processing operations, as well as strategic information
systems planning and management, revenue cycle processes, payroll processing,
business office administration, and major system conversions.

Acquisitions, Investments and Dispositions

We have undertaken
strategic initiatives in recent years designed to further focus
on our core healthcare businesses and enhance our competitive position. These
include the following significant acquisitions, investments and dispositions:



McKESSON CORPORATION

•

In November 1999, we acquired Abaton.com, Inc., a provider of
internet-based clinical applications for use by physician practices,
pharmacy benefit managers, benefit payors, laboratories and pharmacies,
for approximately $95 million in cash and the assumption of $8 million of
employee stock incentives.

•

In February 2000, we disposed of our last non-healthcare business, our
wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Water Products Company, for
approximately $1.1 billion in cash.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2000,
we sold a software business, Imnet France S.A.R.L. for net proceeds of $0.8 million.

Competition

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Pharmaceutical
Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments face strong competition, both
in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line, short-line
and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, and
manufacturers engaged in direct distribution. The Pharmaceutical Solutions and
Medical-Surgical Solutions segments face competition from various other service
providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers (as well
as other potential customers of the segments) which may from time to time
decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities
which are provided by the segments and other competing service providers.
Price, quality of service, and, in some cases, convenience to the customer are
generally the principal competitive elements in these segments.

Our Information Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from
many firms, including other computer services firms, consulting firms, shared
service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, hardware vendors and
internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry.
Competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical
coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Other Information About the Business

Customers

— In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth
has been with a limited number of large customers. During 2002, sales to our
largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, and ten largest customers accounted for
approximately 14% and 55% of our revenues. All of these customers are from our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.

Research and Development

— Most of our research and development expenses
are incurred by our Information Solutions segment, where their product
development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to
specific information processing needs of hospitals. We believe a substantial
and sustained commitment to such research and development (“R&D”) expenditures
is important to the long-term success of this business.

Investment in software development includes both R&D expense as well as
capitalized software held for sale. The Information Solutions segment expended
$145.1 million (15% of revenue) for R&D activities during 2002, compared to
$152.5 million (16% of revenue) and $148.4 million (14% of revenue) during 2001
and 2000. The Information Solutions segment capitalized 21%, 20% and 29% of
its R&D expenditures in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Information regarding R&D is
included in Financial Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
“Significant Accounting Policies,” appearing on pages 54 to 57 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental Legislation

—We sold our chemical distribution operations in
1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations.
Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may
require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These
matters are described further in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” on page 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than any capital expenditures that may be
required in connection with those matters, we do not anticipate making
substantial capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, or be
required to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. The
amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not
material in 2002 and is not expected to be material in the next year.

Employees

— On March 31, 2002, we employed approximately 24,000 persons
compared with 23,000 in 2001 and 21,100 in 2000.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export
Sales

— Information as to foreign operations is included in Financial Notes 1
and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting
Policies” and “Segments of Business,” appearing on
pages 54 to 57 and 88 to 90
of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Item 2.  Properties

Because of the nature of our principal businesses, plant, warehousing,
office and other facilities are operated in widely dispersed locations. The
warehouses are typically owned or leased on a long-term basis. We consider our
operating properties to be in satisfactory condition and adequate to meet our
needs for the next several years without making capital expenditures materially
higher than historical levels. Information as to material lease commitments is
included in Financial Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, “Lease
Obligations,” appearing on page 68 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

I. Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by McKesson, formerly known as McKesson HBOC,
Inc., in April, May and July of 1999 that McKesson had determined that certain
software sales transactions in its Information Technology Business unit (now
referred to as the Information Solutions segment), were improperly recorded as
revenue and reversed, as of May 10, 2002, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed
against McKesson, HBO & Company (“HBOC”), certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s
current or former officers or directors, and other defendants, including Bear
Stearns & Co. Inc. (“Bear Stearns”) and Arthur Andersen LLP (“Andersen”).



McKESSON CORPORATION

Federal Actions

Sixty-seven of the above-mentioned actions have been filed in Federal
Court (the “Federal Actions”). Of these, sixty-one were filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California, one in the Northern
District of Illinois, which has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice,
one in the Northern District of Georgia, which has been transferred to the
Northern District of California, one in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
which has been transferred to the Northern District of California, two in the
Western District of Louisiana, which have been transferred to the Northern
District of California, and one in the District of Arizona, which has been
transferred to the Northern District of California.

On November 2, 1999, the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the Northern
District of California issued an order consolidating fifty-three of these
actions into one consolidated action entitled

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc.
Securities Litigation

, (Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”).
By order dated December 22, 1999, Judge Whyte appointed the New York State
Common Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff”) and approved Lead
Plaintiff’s choice of counsel.

By order dated February 7, 2000, Judge Whyte coordinated a class action
alleging claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (commonly
known as “ERISA”),

Chang v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., (Case No. C-00-20030
RMW), and a shareholder derivative action that had been filed in the Northern
District under the caption

Cohen v. McCall et al.

, (Case No. C-99-20916 RMW)
with the Consolidated Action. There has been no further significant activity
in the

Cohen

action. Recent developments in the

Chang

action are discussed
below.

Lead Plaintiff filed an Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint
(the “ACCAC”) on February 25, 2000. The ACCAC generally alleged that
defendants violated the federal securities laws in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May and July 1999. On September
28, 2000, Judge Whyte dismissed all of the ACCAC claims against McKesson under
Section 11 of the Securities Act with prejudice, dismissed a claim under
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act with leave to amend, and declined to dismiss
a claim against McKesson under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.

On November 14, 2000, Lead Plaintiff filed its Second Amended and
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“SAC”). As with its ACCAC, Lead
Plaintiff’s SAC generally alleged that McKesson violated the federal securities
laws in connection with the events leading to McKesson’s announcements in
April, May and July 1999. The SAC names McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s
or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, Andersen and Bear Stearns
as defendants. The SAC purported to state claims against McKesson and HBOC
under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act.

On January 11, 2001, McKesson filed an action in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California against the Lead Plaintiff in the
Consolidated Action individually, and as a representative of a defendant class
of former HBOC shareholders who exchanged HBOC shares for Company shares in the
January 12, 1999 merger of a McKesson subsidiary into HBOC (the “Merger”),

McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State Common Retirement Fund, Inc. et al.

,
(Case No. C01-20021 RMW) (the “Complaint and Counterclaim”). In the Complaint
and Counterclaim, the Company alleges that the exchanged HBOC shares were
artificially inflated due to undisclosed accounting improprieties, and that the
exchange ratio therefore provided more shares to former HBOC shareholders than
would have otherwise been the case. In this action, the Company seeks to
recover the “unjust enrichment” received by those HBOC shareholders who
exchanged more than 20,000 HBOC shares in the Merger. The Company does not
allege any wrongdoing by these shareholders. On January 9, 2002, Judge Whyte
dismissed the Complaint and Counterclaim with prejudice. On February 8, 2002,
the Company filed a Notice of Appeal from this ruling to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”). The Company’s
opening brief to the Ninth Circuit is currently due to be filed on or before
July 5, 2002. Because certain decisions of the Ninth Circuit raise a question
as to whether the Ninth Circuit has appellate jurisdiction over the Company’s
appeal, the Company has also filed a motion before Judge Whyte for an order
certifying his January 9 dismissal order for immediate appeal.

On January 7, 2002, Judge Whyte dismissed the claim in the SAC against
McKesson under Section 10(b), to the extent that the claim was based on any
pre-Merger conduct or statements by McKesson, and also dismissed the claim
against McKesson under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, granting Lead
Plaintiff thirty (30) days leave “for one last opportunity” to amend those
claims. Judge Whyte dismissed the claim against HBOC under Section 14(a) of
the



McKESSON CORPORATION

Exchange Act without leave to amend. The Section 10(b) claim based on
post-Merger statements remains pending against McKesson, and a Section 10(b)
claim based on pre-Merger statements remains pending against HBOC.

On February 15, 2002, Lead Plaintiff filed a Third Amended and
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the “TAC”) in the Consolidated Action.
The TAC, like the SAC, purports to state claims against McKesson and HBOC under
Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May and July 1999, and names
McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or
directors, Andersen and Bear Stearns as defendants. On April 5, 2002,
McKesson filed a motion to dismiss Lead Plaintiff’s claim under Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act to the extent that it is based on McKesson’s pre-Merger
conduct, and the claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act in its entirety.
McKesson’s motion to dismiss was heard on June 7, 2002, and the court has not
yet issued an opinion.

Several individual actions have also been filed in or transferred to the
Northern District of California. On November 12, 1999, an individual
shareholder action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California under the caption

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

,
(C-99-21192 RMW). The Plaintiffs in

Jacobs

are former HBOC shareholders who
acquired their HBOC shares pursuant to a registration statement issued by HBOC
prior to the Merger, and then exchanged their HBOC shares for McKesson shares
in the Merger. Plaintiffs in

Jacobs

assert claims under federal and state
securities laws and a claim for common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including attorneys’
fees. Judge Whyte’s December 22, 1999, order consolidated the

Jacobs

action
with the Consolidated Action. With leave of court, the

Jacobs

plaintiffs
amended their complaint, but the action remains stayed and there has been no
discovery, motion practice or other activity in the case.

On September 21, 2000, the plaintiffs in

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

,
filed a new individual action entitled

Jacobs v. HBO & Company

(Case No.
C-00-20974 RMW). The

Jacobs

complaint names only HBOC as a defendant and
asserts claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act and various state law causes of action. The complaint
seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and costs of suit,
including attorneys’ fees. This action has been assigned to Judge Whyte and
consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On December 16, 1999, an individual action was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California under the caption

Bea v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al

., (Case No. C-00-20072 RMW). Plaintiffs in

Bea

filed an
Amended Complaint on March 9, 2000. Plaintiffs in

Bea

allege that they
acquired the Company’s common stock prior to the Merger and sold that stock
after the April 1999 announcement at a loss. The

Bea

complaint asserts claims
under the federal and state securities laws, and a claim for fraud. Plaintiffs
seek (i) unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and (ii) reasonable
costs and expenses of suit, including attorneys’ fees.

Bea

is currently stayed
and has been consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On January 7, 2000, an individual action was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California under the caption

Cater v.
McKesson Corporation et al

., (Case No. C-00-20327 RMW). The plaintiff is Terry
Cater, a former employee of the Company who, at the time he ceased active
employment with the Company, held options to purchase shares of Company stock,
and also held shares of the Company’s restricted stock. Plaintiff alleges that
these options and restricted stock were substantially devalued as a result of
the Merger and the subsequent drop in the Company’s stock price. Plaintiff in

Cater

asserts claims under the federal securities laws as well as claims for
breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
Plaintiff seeks (i) unspecified special damages in excess of $50,000, (ii)
unspecified general damages, (iii) prejudgment interest and (iv) reasonable
attorneys’ fees. The case has been assigned to Judge Whyte and the parties
have stipulated to a stay pending the outcome of the motions to dismiss in the
Consolidated Action.

On February 7, 2000, an action entitled

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al

., (Case No. CV 00-0188) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Louisiana. The same plaintiffs then filed a virtually identical
parallel action in Louisiana State Court, Rapides Parish, under the caption

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al

. (filed as Case No. 199018; Case No.
CV-00-0522 after removal to federal court). Plaintiffs, former shareholders of
Automatic Prescription Services, allege claims under the federal securities
laws, and claims for breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and
detrimental reliance. The state court action was removed to federal court and
the two

Baker

cases have been transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.



McKESSON CORPORATION

On July 27, 2001, an action was filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California captioned

Pacha, et al., v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc., et al

., (No. C01-20713 PVT) (“

Pacha

”). The

Pacha

plaintiffs allege
that they were individual shareholders of McKesson stock on November 27, 1998,
and assert that McKesson and HBOC violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act
and SEC Rule 14a-9, and that McKesson, aided by HBOC, breached its fiduciary
duties to plaintiffs by issuing a joint proxy statement in connection with the
Merger which allegedly contained false and misleading statements or omissions.
Plaintiffs name as defendants McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former
officers or directors of McKesson or HBOC, Andersen and Bear Stearns. On
November 13, 2001, Judge Whyte ordered

Pacha

consolidated with the Consolidated
Action and stayed all further proceedings.

Hess v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., an action filed in state court in
Arizona (Case No. C-20003862) on behalf of former shareholders of Ephrata
Diamond Spring Water Company (“Ephrata”) who acquired McKesson shares in
exchange for their Ephrata stock when McKesson acquired Ephrata in January
1999, was removed to federal court, transferred to the Northern District and
consolidated with the Consolidated Action. Judge Whyte also stayed all further
proceedings in

Hess

except for the filing of an amended complaint, which was
filed on or about December 15, 2001 (the “

Hess

Amended Complaint”). The

Hess

Amended Complaint generally incorporates the allegations and claims asserted in
Lead Plaintiff’s SAC in the Consolidated Action and also includes various
common law causes of action relating to McKesson’s acquisition of Ephrata. The
Company is not currently required to respond to the

Hess

Amended Complaint.

On June 28, 2001, the

Chang

plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against
McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of McKesson or
HBOC, and The Chase Manhattan Bank. The amended complaint in

Chang

generally
alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with
administering the McKesson HBOC Profit Sharing Investment Plan (the “PSI Plan”)
and the HBOC Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”). Plaintiffs in

Chang

are alleged former employees of McKesson and participants in the PSI
Plan, and purportedly seek relief under sections 404-405, 409 and 502 of ERISA
on behalf of a class defined to include participants in the PSI Plan, including
participants under the HBOC Plan, who maintained an account balance under the
PSI Plan as of April 27, 1999, who had not received a distribution from the PSI
Plan as of April 27, 1999, and who suffered losses as a result of the alleged
breaches of duty. Plaintiff seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and HBOC
breached their fiduciary duties, (ii) an order requiring defendants to restore
to the PSI Plan all losses caused by these purported breaches of fiduciary
duty, and (iii) attorneys’ fees. In October 2001, McKesson, HBOC, Chase and
other defendants moved to dismiss the

Chang

action. These motions are
currently set for hearing on May 17, 2002.

On February 7, 2002, an action was filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California captioned

Adams v. McKesson
Information Solutions, Inc. et al

., No. C-02-06 85 JCS (“

Adams

”). Plaintiff in

Adams

filed a first amended complaint on March 15, 2002, against McKesson
Information Solutions, Inc. (formerly HBOC), McKesson, certain current or
former officers, directors or employees of McKesson or HBOC, and other
defendants. Plaintiff alleges that he was a participant in the HBOC Plan and
generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC breached their fiduciary duties to the
HBOC Plan and its participants or engaged in transactions prohibited by ERISA.
Plaintiff asserts his claims on behalf of a putative class defined to include
all participants in the HBOC Plan and their beneficiaries for whose benefit the
HBOC Plan acquired HBOC stock from March 31, 1996 to April 1, 1999. Plaintiff
seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and HBOC breached their fiduciary duties,
(ii) an order requiring defendants to restore to the plan all losses caused by
these purported breaches of fiduciary duty, and (iii) reasonable attorneys’
fees, costs and expenses. On April 3, 2002, Judge Whyte issued a Related Case
Order in which he found that

Adams

is related to the Consolidated Action. By
operation of a pretrial order entered in the Consolidated Action, Judge Whyte’s
Related Case Order automatically consolidated

Adams

into the Consolidated
Action. On April 25, 2002, Plaintiff filed an application with the Court
requesting that the

Adams

action be relieved from automatic consolidation with
the Consolidated Action, which HBOC intends to oppose. Defendants are
presently not obligated to respond to the first amended complaint.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have also been filed in various state courts in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State
Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State Actions generally allege
misconduct by McKesson or HBOC in connection with the events leading to
McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Two of the State Actions are derivative actions:

Ash, et al., v. McCall,
et al

., (Case No. 17132), filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and

Mitchell v.
McCall et al.

, (Case. No. 304415), filed in California Superior Court, City and
County of San Francisco. McKesson moved to dismiss both of these actions and
to stay the

Mitchell

action in favor of the earlier filed

Ash

and

Cohen

derivative actions. Plaintiffs in

Mitchell

agreed to defer any action by the
court on McKesson’s motions pending resolution of McKesson’s dismissal motion
in

Ash

. On September 15, 2000, in the

Ash

case, the Court of Chancery
dismissed all causes of action with leave to re-plead certain of the dismissed
claims, and on January 22, 2001, the

Ash

plaintiffs filed a Third Amended
Complaint which is presently the subject of McKesson’s motion to dismiss.

Five of the State Actions are class actions. Three of these were filed in
Delaware Chancery Court:

Derdiger v. Tallman et al.

, (Case No. 17276),

Carroll
v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

, (Case No. 17454),

and Kelly v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al

., (Case No. 17282 NC). Two additional actions were filed in Delaware
Superior Court:

Edmondson v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

, (Case No. 99-951) and

Caravetta v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

, (Case No. 00C-04-214 WTQ). The

Carroll

and

Kelly

actions have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. McKesson
removed

Edmondson

to federal court in Delaware and filed a motion to dismiss,
which was granted by the federal court on March 5, 2002. McKesson filed
motions to stay the

Derdiger

and

Caravetta

actions in favor of proceedings in
the federal Consolidated Action, which were granted. On December 20, 2001, the
plaintiff in the

Derdiger

action filed a motion to vacate the stay, but that
motion has not yet been briefed or heard by the Court.

Several of the State Actions are individual actions which have been filed
in various state courts. Five of these were filed in the California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco:

Yurick v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

,
(Case No. 303857),

The State of Oregon by and through the Oregon Public
Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No. 307619),

Utah State Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., (Case No. 311269),

Minnesota State Board of Investment v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No.
311747), and

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al

., CGC-02-405792. In

Yurick

, the trial court has sustained
McKesson’s demurrer to the original complaint without leave to amend with
respect to all causes of action except plaintiffs’ claims for common law fraud
and negligent misrepresentation, which the trial court has allowed to remain in
the case. The Court also stayed

Yurick

pending the commencement of discovery
in the Consolidated Action, but allowed the filing of an amended complaint. On
May 23, 2001, the California Court of Appeals affirmed the

Yurick

trial court’s
order dismissing claims against certain of the individual defendants without
leave to amend. On July 31, 2001, McKesson’s demurrer to the Second Amended
Complaint was overruled and McKesson’s alternative motion to strike was denied.

The

Oregon

,

Utah

and

Minnesota

actions referenced above are individual
securities actions filed in the California Superior Court for the City and
County of San Francisco by out-of-state pension funds. On April 20, 2001,
plaintiffs in

Utah

and

Minnesota

filed amended complaints against McKesson,
HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of McKesson or HBOC,
Andersen and Bear Stearns. The amended complaints in

Utah

and

Minnesota

assert
claims under California and Georgia’s securities laws, claims under Georgia’s
RICO statute, and various common law claims under California and Georgia law.
On June 22, 2001, McKesson and HBOC demurred to and moved to strike portions of
the amended complaints and also moved to stay these actions pending the final
resolution of the Consolidated Action. The court held hearings on McKesson’s
demurrers and motions to strike on November 15, 2001, January 29, 2002, and
April 23, 2002, but has not issued a final ruling on the motions. By order
dated December 3, 2001, the court denied McKesson’s motion to stay the entire
action pending the final resolution of the Consolidated Action but ordered that
all discoveries in the

Utah

and

Minnesota

actions would be stayed pending the
commencement of discovery in the Consolidated Action.

On May 30, 2001, plaintiffs in

Oregon

filed a second amended complaint
against McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of
McKesson or HBOC, and Andersen. The second amended complaint in

Oregon

asserts claims under California and Georgia’s securities laws, claims under
Georgia’s RICO statute, and various common law claims under California and
Georgia law. The parties to the

Oregon

action previously agreed to a stay of
all proceedings in that action, other than motions to test the sufficiency of
the pleadings, pending the commencement of discovery in the Consolidated
Action. On April 4, 2001, the plaintiff in

Oregon

filed a motion to lift the
stipulated stay of discovery, which McKesson and HBOC opposed. McKesson also
moved the court for an order modifying the stipulated stay to stay all
proceedings in the action pending the final resolution of the Consolidated
Action. Also on June 22, 2001, McKesson and HBOC demurred to and moved to
strike portions of

Oregon’s

second amended complaint. The court held hearings
on McKesson’s demurrers and motions to strike on November 15, 2001, January



McKESSON CORPORATION

29, 2002, and April 23, 2002, but has not issued a final ruling on the
motions. By order dated December 7, 2001, the court denied McKesson’s motion
to stay all proceedings in

Oregon

but ordered that all discoveries would be
stayed pending the commencement of discovery in the Consolidated Action.

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al.

, CGC-02-405792 (“

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund

”) was filed on March
19, 2002, in Superior Court in San Francisco. Plaintiffs in

Merrill Lynch
Fundamental Growth Fund

allege that they purchased Company stock after the
Merger and sold that stock at a loss after April 28, 1999. Plaintiffs name as
defendants the Company, HBOC, Andersen, Bear Stearns and certain current or
former officers or directors of the Company or HBOC, and assert causes of
action under California’s securities statutes, Business and Professions Code §
17200, and common law claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting in connection with the events leading to
McKesson’s need to restate HBOC’s financial statements. Plaintiffs also assert
claims under New Jersey’s RICO statute, Georgia’s securities statutes, and
Georgia RICO. Plaintiffs seek restitution in an unspecified amount,
unspecified compensatory and treble damages, reasonable attorneys’ and experts’
fees, and costs and expenses. The Company’s counsel and counsel for the
plaintiffs are currently discussing an appropriate response date to the
complaint.

Several individual actions have been filed in various state courts outside
of California. Several of these cases have been filed in Georgia state courts.
On October 29, 1999, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court under the
caption

Powell v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, and (Case No. 1999-CV- 15443).
Plaintiff in

Powell

is a former HBOC employee seeking lost commissions as well
as asserting claims under Georgia’s securities and racketeering laws, and
various common law causes of action. The

Powell

action names as defendants the
Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. The Company filed a motion
to stay, which was granted as to the Georgia securities law claims but not the
Georgia RICO claims. Plaintiff thereafter voluntarily dismissed the action.
On September 11, 2000, Plaintiff re-filed his action under the caption

Powell
v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., Case No. 2000-CV-27864, reasserting the same
claims against the same defendants. On October 11, 2000, McKesson and HBOC
filed answers, motions to dismiss, and motions for a partial stay. The motions
for partial stay were granted. This case has been settled and the action was
dismissed on February 22, 2002.

On December 9, 1999, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Gwinnett
County, under the caption

Adler v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No.
99-C-7980-3). Plaintiff in

Adler

is a former HBOC shareholder and asserts a
claim for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance. The

Adler

action names
as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. Plaintiff
seeks damages in excess of $43 million, as well as punitive damages, and costs
of suit, including attorneys’ fees. The Company has answered the complaint in

Adler

. On May 26, 2000, the court denied McKesson’s motion to stay. On July
14, 2000, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, which McKesson and HBOC
answered on August 21, 2000. Discovery has commenced in the

Adler

action and
is ongoing.

On October 24, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned:

Suffolk Partners Limited Partnership et al., v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al

., (No. 00VS010469A). Plaintiffs in the

Suffolk

action
allegedly purchased the Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the
April 1999 announcement. Plaintiffs assert claims under Georgia’s securities
and racketeering laws, and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The

Suffolk

action names as defendants
the Company, HBOC, and certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, and Andersen. Like the Consolidated Action, the claims
in the

Suffolk

action generally arise out of the January 12, 1999, Merger, and
the Company’s announcement of the need to restate its financial statements.
Plaintiffs seek (i) compensatory damages of approximately $21.8 million, as
well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with respect to
certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Company and HBOC separately answered the complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the

Suffolk

action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. On August 2,
2001, the Court granted the motions to stay, and this case is stayed until all
discoveries are completed in the Consolidated Class Action pending in
California.

On November 1, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned:

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. ET al.

, and
(No. 00 VS 010801). Plaintiff in the

Curran

action allegedly purchased the
Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999 announcement.
The claims in the

Curran

action are identical to the claims in the

Suffolk

action. Plaintiff seeks (i) compensatory damages of approximately $2.6
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble



McKESSON CORPORATION

damages, and (ii) prejudgment and post-judgment interest and costs of
suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees. The

Curran

action
names as defendants the Company, HBOC, and certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s
current or former officers or directors, and Andersen. The Company and HBOC
separately answered the complaint on January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC
moved for an order staying the

Curran

action in favor of the Consolidated
Action on January 10, 2001. The Court granted the motions to stay on August
22, 2001.

On December 12, 2001, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned:

Drake v. McKesson Corp., et al.

, and (Case No. 01VS026303A).
Plaintiff in

Drake

is a former HBOC employee seeking lost commissions as well
as asserting claims under Georgia’s securities and racketeering laws, and
various common law causes of action. Plaintiff seeks (i) approximately $0.3
million in unpaid commissions, (ii) unspecified compensatory, consequential,
actual, exemplary, and punitive damages, and (iii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
The

Drake

action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and
Jay Gilbertson. The parties entered into a Consent Order for Partial Stay on
February 27, 2002, which stayed Plaintiff’s Georgia securities law, fraud and
RICO claims. On March 4, 2002, McKesson and McKesson Information Solutions
Inc. separately filed their answers.

On January 31, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton
County, under the caption

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v McKesson, Inc. et.
al.

, (Case No. 2002-CV-48407). Plaintiffs in the

Green

action are former HBOC
shareholders and assert claims for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance.
Plaintiff Holcombe Green was also a former officer, chairman and director of
HBOC. The

Green

action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi
and Jay Gilbertson. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $100
million, as well as unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and
costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. The Company and HBOC filed their
respective answers and counterclaims on April 22, 2002. The Company and HBOC
also filed their motions to stay and dismiss. Discovery is under way and will
proceed for some time, unless the court grants the Company’s and HBOC’s motions
to stay and/or dismiss.

On February 6, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton
County, under the caption

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson, Inc. et
al.

, (Case No. 2002-CV-48612). Plaintiff in the

Hall

action is a former HBOC
shareholder and asserts a claim for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance.
The

Hall

action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay
Gilbertson. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in excess of $100 million, as
well as unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit,
including attorneys’ fees. The Company and HBOC filed their respective answers
on April 22, 2002. The Company also filed its counterclaim for unjust
enrichment. On April 26, 2002, the Company and HBOC filed motions to stay and
dismiss. HBOC also filed a third party complaint against Holcombe Green for
indemnification. Discovery is under way and will proceed for some time, unless
the court grants the Company’s and HBOC’s motions to stay and/or dismiss.
Additionally, the defendants in

Hall

have moved to have the case consolidated
with the

Green

action.

On September 28, 1999, an action was filed in Delaware Superior Court
under the caption

Kelly v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, and (C.A. No. 99C-09-265
WCC). Plaintiffs in

Kelly

are former shareholders of KWS&P/SFA, which merged
into McKesson after the HBOC transaction. Plaintiffs assert claims under the
federal securities laws, as well as claims for breach of contract and breach of
the duty of good faith and fair dealing. On January 17, 2002, the Delaware
Superior Court denied the

Kelly

plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment
and denied McKesson’s motion to dismiss, while granting the motions to dismiss
for lack of personal jurisdiction that were filed by certain former officers
and directors of McKesson and HBOC. The parties thereafter commenced discovery
by exchanging document requests and interrogatories. The court in

Kelly

has
scheduled a trial to begin on May 5, 2003.

The United States Attorneys’ Office and the Securities and Exchange
Commission are conducting investigations into the matters leading to the
restatement. On May 15, 2000, the United States Attorney’s Office filed a
one-count information against former HBOC officer, Dominick DeRosa, charging
Mr. DeRosa with aiding and abetting securities fraud, and on May 15, 2000, Mr.
DeRosa entered a guilty plea to that charge. On September 28, 2000, an
indictment was unsealed in the Northern District of California against former
HBOC officer, Jay P. Gilbertson, and former Company and HBOC officer, Albert J.
Bergonzi (United States v. Bergonzi, et al., Case No. CR-00-0505). On that
same date, a civil complaint was filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission against Mr. Gilbertson, Mr. Bergonzi and Mr. DeRosa (Securities and
Exchange Commission v. Gilbertson, et al., Case No. C-00-3570). Mr. DeRosa
has settled with the Securities Exchange Commission without admitting or
denying the substantive allegations of the complaint. On January 10, 2001, the
grand jury returned a superseding indictment in the Northern District of



McKESSON CORPORATION

California against Messrs. Gilbertson and Bergonzi (United States v.
Bergonzi, et al., Case No. CR-00-0505). On September 27, 2001, the Securities
and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against six former HBOC
officers and employees. Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission’s civil
complaints, four of the six defendants settled the claims brought against them
by, among other things, consenting, without admitting or denying the
allegations of the complaints, to entry of permanent injunctions against all of
the alleged violations, and agreed to pay civil penalties in various amounts.
On January 3, 2002, the Company was notified in writing by the Securities and
Exchange Commission that its investigation has been terminated as to the
Company, and that no enforcement action has been recommended to the Commission.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings, or to estimate the amounts
of, or potential range of, loss with respect to those proceedings. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain.
The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments
against the Company or settlements that could require substantial payments by
the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigation and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for product liability and other damages, investigations relating to
governmental laws and regulations, and other matters arising out of the normal
conduct of our business. These include:

Antitrust Matters

We are currently a defendant in numerous civil antitrust actions filed
since 1993 in federal and state courts by retail pharmacies. The federal cases
were coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court in
the Northern District of Illinois and are known as MDL 997. MDL 997 consists
of approximately 109 actions brought by approximately 3,500 individual retail,
chain and supermarket pharmacies (the “Individual Actions”). In 1999, the
court dismissed a related class action following a judgment as a matter of law
entered in favor of defendants, which was unsuccessfully appealed. There are
numerous other defendants in these actions, including several pharmaceutical
manufacturers and several other wholesale distributors. These cases allege, in
essence, that the defendants have violated the Sherman Act by conspiring to fix
the prices of brand-name pharmaceuticals sold to plaintiffs at artificially
high, and non-competitive levels, especially as compared with the prices
charged to mail-order pharmacies, managed care organizations and other
institutional buyers. The wholesalers’ motion for summary judgment in the
Individual Actions has been granted. Plaintiffs have appealed to the Seventh
Circuit. On May 6, 2002, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the summary judgment.

Most of the individual cases brought by chain stores have been settled.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation recommended remand of the
Sherman Act claims in MDL 997 and on November 2, 2001, the court remanded those
claims to their original jurisdictions.

A state court antitrust case against McKesson and other defendants is
currently pending in California. This case is based on essentially the same
facts alleged in the Federal Class Action and Individual Actions and asserts
violations of state antitrust and/or unfair competition laws. The case
(

Paradise Drugs, et al. v. Abbott Laboratories

,

et al.

, (Case No. CV793852) was
filed in the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara and was transferred to
the Superior Court for the County of San Francisco. The case is trailing MDL
997.

In each of the cases, plaintiffs seek remedies in the form of injunctive
relief and unquantified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.
Plaintiffs in the California cases also seek restitution. In addition, treble
damages are sought in the Individual Actions and the California case. We and
other wholesalers have entered into a judgment sharing agreement with certain
pharmaceutical manufacturer defendants, which provides generally that we,
together with the other wholesale distributor defendants, will be held harmless
by such pharmaceutical manufacturer defendants and will be indemnified against
the costs of adverse judgments, if any, against the wholesaler and
manufacturers in these or similar actions, in excess of $1 million in the
aggregate per wholesale distributor defendant.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical, is one of many defendants in
approximately 138 cases in which plaintiffs claim that they were injured due to
exposure, over many years, to the latex proteins in gloves manufactured by
numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors, including
McKesson Medical-Surgical. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its
suppliers are continuing and a final agreement has been reached with one major
supplier. McKesson Medical-Surgical’s insurers are providing coverage for
these cases, subject to the applicable deductibles.

We, along with 134 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit brought
by the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (“the Foundation”)
alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven U.S. patents
relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the automated
management and control of product inventory, warehousing, distribution and
point-of-sale transactions. The Foundation seeks to enter into a license
agreement with us, the lump sum fee for which would be based upon a fraction of
a percent of our overall revenues over the past ten years. Due to the pendency
of earlier litigation brought against the Foundation attacking the validity of
the patents at issue, the court has stayed the action until the conclusion of
the earlier case.

III. Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses,
which were divested in 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations. We have received claims and demands from
governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly
required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at five sites
where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations; and we, by
administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain actions at those
sites, including soil and groundwater remediation.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with
outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of
reasonably possible remediation costs for these five sites is approximately $13
million, net of approximately $1.5 million which third parties have agreed to
pay in settlement or which we expect, based either on agreements or
nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third
parties. The $13 million is expected to be paid out between April 2002 and
March 2029. Our liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a potentially responsible party,
or PRP, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law or its state law
equivalent) for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our
alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 19 sites. With respect to each of
these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and, while the
current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon
PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with
other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 19 PRP sites is approximately $1.1
million. The aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in Superfund matters
to date have not been significant. The accompanying consolidated balance
sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain
due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup
costs; the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportion to other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs are
recover able from insurance or other parties.

Except as specifically stated above with respect to the litigation matters
summarized under “Accounting Litigation” above, we believe, based on current
knowledge and the advice of our counsel, that the outcome of the litigation and
governmental proceedings discussed under “Legal Proceedings” will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

leading pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical
Solutions business also includes the manufacture and sale of automated
pharmaceutical dispensing systems for hospitals and retail pharmacists, medical
management services and tools to payors and providers, marketing and other
support services to pharmaceutical manufacturers, consulting and outsourcing
services to pharmacies, and distribution of first-aid products to industrial
and commercial customers. The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distributes
medical-surgical supplies and equipment, and provides logistics and related
services within the U.S. The Information Solutions segment delivers
enterprise-wide patient care, clinical, financial, supply chain, managed care
and strategic management software solutions, as well as outsourcing and other
services, to healthcare organizations throughout the U.S. and certain foreign
countries.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

As reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.
GAAP), net income was $418.6 million in 2002, a net loss of $48.3 million in
2001, and net income of $723.7 million in 2000, and diluted earnings (loss) per
share were $1.43, $(0.17) and $2.55. U.S. GAAP financial results include
pre-tax special charges of $88.5 million, $458.3 million and $127.5 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000. After taxes, these charges amounted to $20.6 million,
$325.7 million and $80.4 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, or $0.06, $1.14 and
$0.28 per diluted share. Results for 2001 and 2000 also include after-tax
results from discontinued operations of a loss of $5.6 million and income of
$23.2 million, or $(0.02) and $0.08 per diluted share, primarily relating to
the disposition of our Water Products business. Fiscal 2000 results also
include a gain on the disposition of our Water Products business of $515.9
million, or $1.82 per diluted share.

Net income and net income per diluted share before special charges and
discontinued operations increased by 55% and 51% to $439.2 million and $1.49 in
2002, from $283.0 million and $0.99 in 2001. This compares to an increase of
7% and 6% from 2000 to 2001. Revenues increased by 19% to $50.0 billion in
2002 and by 14% to $42.0 billion in 2001, from $36.7 billion in 2000.
Excluding the impact of special charges and discontinued operations, the
increase in operating profit, net income and earnings per share over the last
two years primarily reflects revenue growth and operating margin expansion in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and improved operating profit in our
Information Solutions segment. The increase in financial results from 2001 to
2002 was also attributable to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in
accordance with our implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Pro forma financial data is provided as an alternative for understanding
our results, as we believe such discussion is the most informative
representation of recurring and non-recurring, non-transactional-related
operating results. Pro forma financial results exclude special charges and
discontinued operations. These measures are not in accordance with, or an
alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from pro forma measures used by
other companies.

The following discussion regarding our financial results excludes special
charges. Special charges are discussed in detail commencing on page 35 which include a reconciliation of pro forma financial results to those
reported under U.S. GAAP.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

(1)

In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14, “Income
Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for “Out-of-Pocket”
Expenses Incurred,” we reclassified $11.4 million and $23.1 million
reimbursable “out-of-pocket” expenses from cost of sales to service
revenues for 2001 and 2000 for our Information Solutions segment.
In addition, Corporate revenues of $2.3 million and $2.1 million for 2001
and 2000, and related cost of sales, have been reclassified to other
income.

Consolidated revenues increased 19% in 2002 and 14% in 2001. Excluding
sales to customers’ warehouses, consolidated revenues increased 18% in 2002 as
compared to 12% in 2001. The growth in revenues was primarily driven by the
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which accounted for 93% of our 2002
consolidated revenues. Excluding sales to customers’ warehouses,
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment revenues increased 20% in 2002 as compared to
14% in 2001. Consolidated revenues were not materially impacted by business
acquisitions, which are described in further detail commencing on page 40.

The improvement in U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution revenues, excluding
sales to customers’ warehouses, was primarily due to increased sales volume to
our retail chain and institutional customers. These increases were for both
new pharmaceutical business that was previously shipped direct or outside the
distribution channel, as well as for increased volume from existing customers.
We believe that we have attracted this increase in sales volume due in large
part to the wide range of products and services that we can offer our
customers. Our retail customers have benefited from our service offerings and
programs that focus on broad product selection, service levels, inventory
carrying cost reductions, connectivity and automation technologies.
Institutional customers have benefited from our focus on reducing both product
cost and internal labor and logistics costs for their customers. Services
available include pharmaceutical distribution, medical-surgical supply
distribution, pharmaceutical dispensing automation, pharmacy outsourcing and
utilization reviews. In addition, our ability to provide patient-assisted
programs and the distribution of specialty products has also contributed to our
increase in revenues. These retail chain and institutional capabilities have
resulted in the implementation of significant long-term contracts with major
customers.

The customer mix of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution revenues,
excluding sales to customers’ warehouses, was as follows:




Independents


%

Retail Chains




Institutions




Total


%


%


%

U.S. pharmaceutical distribution sales to customers’ warehouses increased
23% over each of the comparable prior years, reflecting the addition of a few
significant retail chain customers as well as growth from existing customers.
Sales to customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals
to major self-warehousing drugstore chains whereby we act as an intermediary in
the order and subsequent delivery of products directly from the manufacturer to
the customers’ warehouses. These sales provide a benefit to our customers in
that they can use one source for both their direct store-to-store business and
their warehouse business.

International pharmaceutical distribution revenues, which are derived from
our Canadian operations, increased by 9% in 2002 and 19% in 2001, reflecting
increased sales volume to our customers. Revenues for 2001 had one extra
selling week as compared to 2002 and 2000.

Medical-Surgical
Solutions’ distribution revenues were flat in 2002. Increases in
our primary and extended care products were almost fully offset by a decline in
revenues for acute care products. Revenues in 2001 increased by 3%, reflecting
modest growth in our primary and extended care products, partially offset by a
decline in our acute care products. The segment’s decline in its acute care
business reflects the competitive environment in which it operates. In
addition, in 2002, one large customer began self-warehousing certain products
directly from the manufacturers.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Information Solutions segment revenues increased 7% in 2002 compared to a
decrease of 10% in 2001. Software revenues increased by 37% in 2002, compared
to a decrease of 7% in 2001. The increase in 2002 software revenues was
largely due to new contracts for our products from our Horizon Clinicals™
offerings, which was introduced in July of 2001. Our Horizon Clinicals™
products are designed to provide an integrated clinical repository, common
architecture and the advanced functionality required to support clinicians in
providing high-quality, cost-effective patient care across multiple care
settings. The decrease in 2001 software revenues was primarily due to the
deferral of revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting for
certain contracts.

Service revenues increased 2% in 2002 compared to a decrease of 10% in
2001. The increase in service revenues in 2002 primarily reflects additional
outsourcing arrangements. Service revenues declined in 2001, reflecting the
delayed impact of reduced prior period software sales on implementation service
revenues.

Hardware revenues for 2002 were flat compared to 2001, which was slightly
lower than 2000. Hardware is sold as an accommodation to customers at a
significantly lower operating margin than software and services. The decrease
in 2001 hardware revenues reflects the lower level of software sales, general
price declines for hardware and a shift to less costly platforms.

As of March 31, 2002, backlog for our Information Solutions segment, which
includes firm contracts for maintenance fees, implementation and software
contracts, and outsourcing agreements, increased to $2.1 billion from $1.5
billion a year ago and from $1.6 billion two years ago. The increase in
backlog from 2001 to 2002 resulted primarily from a new ten-year,
$480 million outsourcing contract to provide a standardized, fully automated
human resources and payroll system for the National Health Service of England
and Wales, covering approximately one million employees.

Gross Profit:

(1)

Excludes sales to customers’ warehouses.

Pro forma gross profit increased by $375.3 million in 2002 and $181.6
million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, excluding sales to customers’
warehouses, gross profit margin decreased 14 and 28 basis points in 2002 and
2001. These decreases were primarily the result of a higher proportion of
revenues attributable to our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business, which
has lower margins relative to the other product lines in the segment, partially
offset by an improvement in gross margins from the Information Solutions
segment and to a lesser extent, from the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.
The U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business operates in a highly competitive
environment; however, in 2002, the business was able to maintain its
gross margins due to
expanded product sourcing activities as well as through the
penetration of its generic
drug offerings. Information Solutions’ gross margin increase reflects the sale
of higher margin software in 2002 and a lower revenue base in 2001.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We exclude sales to customer warehouses in analyzing our gross and
operating profits and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues as these
revenues have a significantly lower gross margin compared to traditional direct
store delivery sales because of their low cost-to-serve model (i.e., bulk
shipments to warehouses). These sales do, however, contribute positively to
our cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payment and the
payment to the supplier.

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost
of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than do other accounting
methods, thereby mitigating the effects of inflation and deflation on operating
profit. The practice in the Pharmaceutical Solutions distribution businesses
is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers.
Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which prevents
inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in
this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in
other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in
those fiscal years.

Operating
Expenses and Other Income:

(1)

Includes loss on sales of
businesses.

(2)

Excludes sales to customers’ warehouses.

(3)

Includes other income and gain (loss) on investments.

Pro forma operating expenses increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily
reflecting additional expenses to support our sales volume growth. Offsetting
these increases was the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 due to our
adoption of SFAS No. 142. Pro forma operating expenses in 2001 and 2000,
excluding goodwill amortization of $49.4 million and $37.6 million, was
$1,836.0 million and $1,703.8 million. Expenses also increased from 2000 to
2001, which primarily reflect additional expenses to support our increase in
sales volume and enhanced customer support, and additional spending
in research and development activities to support future product development.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding sales to
customers’ warehouses, have declined over the last two years, primarily
reflecting productivity improvements in both back-office and field operations
and our ability to support additional revenues with a lower proportionate
amount of selling, distribution and administrative expenses within our Pharmaceutical Solutions business.

Other income includes interest income and equity in earnings of our 22%
interest in Nadro S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”), a Mexican pharmaceutical distribution
business and Health Nexis, LLC (“Health Nexis”), an Internet-based company we formed with
other healthcare companies in 2001, as well as special charges relating to
impairments of investments. Also in
2002, we reclassified revenues and cost of sales pertaining to Corporate
activities to other income, which increased other income by $1.7 million and
$1.5 million in 2001 and 2000.

Pro forma other income decreased by $1.9 million to $40.1 million in 2002
and by $6.7 million to $42.0 million in 2001. Results for 2002 reflect a
decrease in Corporate other income of $7.6 million, which includes $3.0 million
of additional losses in Health Nexis as compared to the prior year. In the
third quarter of 2002, Health Nexis merged with another entity, thereby
significantly diluting our ownership percentage in the combined organization.
As a result, we changed from the equity to the cost method of accounting for
this investment. Pharmaceutical Solutions other income increased in 2002 and
decreased in 2001 compared to the prior year, which includes fluctuations in
results from Nadro.

Operating Profit and Corporate Expenses:

(1)

Excludes sales to customers’ warehouses.

Operating profit is
computed as gross margin, less operating expenses,
plus other income for our business segments. Pro forma operating profit
increased 39% in 2002 and 5% in 2001. Operating profit improvements resulted
primarily from continued strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion
in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, combined with improved operating
profits in our Information Solutions segment. Operating profits for 2002 also
benefited from the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with
the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

Excluding sales to customers’ warehouses, pro forma operating profit as a
percentage of revenues increased 28 basis points to 2.43% in 2002 and 25 basis
points to 2.15% in 2001 for our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. The increase
in pro forma operating profit reflects productivity improvements in operations,
expanded product sourcing activities and increased penetration of our generic
drug offerings in our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

offset, in part, by pricing pressures reflecting the competitive environment.
The improvement was also partly attributable to our Canadian pharmaceutical
business, which reflects new customers, sales growth and operational
efficiencies. Fiscal 2002 also benefited from the discontinuance of goodwill
amortization. Partially offsetting those increases for 2001, our Health
Solutions business experienced a loss of a number of customers and
earnings from the segment’s equity interest in Nadro was reduced. Excluding
goodwill amortization of $8.0 million in 2001 and $6.5 million in 2000, pro
forma operating profit as a percentage of revenues increased 25 basis points in
2002 and 26 basis points in 2001.

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment’s pro forma operating profit increased
modestly in 2002 and decreased in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization of
$19.0 million and $19.3 million in 2001 and 2000, pro forma operating profit as
a percentage of revenue was 4.10% and 4.95%, or a decrease of 61 basis points
in 2002 and 85 basis points in 2001. The decrease in operating profit as a
percentage of revenues over the last two years is largely due to additional
operating expenses associated with the segment’s restructuring activities.
These expenses include the duplication of payroll, transportation and warehouse
costs as the segment gradually migrates to fewer distribution centers.

Information Solutions segment’s pro forma operating profit in 2002
reflects the increase in higher margin software revenue and the discontinuance
of goodwill amortization, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses.
The decline in 2001 pro forma operating profit reflects the decrease in
revenues and an increase in the level of expenses to enhance customer support
and future product introduction. Excluding goodwill amortization of $22.4
million in 2001 and $11.8 million in 2000, pro forma operating profit as a
percentage of revenues increased 319 basis points in 2002 and decreased 657
basis points in 2001.

Pro forma Corporate expenses were $145.2 million, $101.0 million and $98.5
million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The increase in 2002 Corporate expenses
reflects expenses associated with borrowings under our credit facilities,
higher benefit costs and our share in the losses of Health Nexis. Pro forma
Corporate expenses for 2001 approximated those of 2000.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense for 2002 approximated that of 2001 and
2000. Interest expense for 2002 reflects the issuance of $400.0 million 7.75%
notes in January 2002 partially offset by the retirement of $175.0 million
6.875% notes in March 2002. We also sold more receivables in 2002 compared to
2001 in order to meet our financing needs. The costs associated with the sale
of receivables are recorded in Corporate expenses. The slight decrease in 2001
interest expense is due to lower average borrowings during the year.

Income Taxes:

The effective income tax rate excluding special charges was
36.0%, 39.0% and 38.5%, for 2002, 2001 and 2000. The reduction in our
effective tax rate in 2002 was the result of certain tax planning initiatives
and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization, which is generally not
tax-deductible. The increase in our effective tax rate from 2000 to 2001
primarily reflects the impact of non-deductible goodwill amortization
associated with purchase acquisitions made in these years.

Discontinued Operations:

Discontinued Operations for 2001 of $5.6 million
primarily relates to the disposition of our Water Products business. Fiscal
2000 results include a gain on the disposition of our Water Products business
of $515.9 million, which we sold for $1.1 billion in cash,
and $23.2 million of results from discontinued operations.

Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding:

Diluted earnings per share
were calculated based on an average number of shares outstanding of 298.1
million, 283.1 million, and 284.2 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000. The
increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding in 2002 was due
to the inclusion of 5.4 million share equivalents relating to our trust
convertible preferred securities and 7.5 million of dilutive securities issued
under employee benefit plans, which were excluded in 2001 as they were
anti-dilutive. The increase was also attributable to a greater number of basic
shares outstanding due to option exercises, partially offset by shares
repurchased as part of our share repurchase program.

International Operations

International
operations accounted for 6.0%, 6.6% and 6.4%, and 6.5%, 5.7%
and 8.7%, of 2002, 2001 and 2000 consolidated revenues and operating profits
before special charges, and 6.1%, 5.6% and 5.8% of consolidated assets at March
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. International operations are subject to certain
opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our
operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and
political environment in each of the countries in which we operate.



Special Charges

We incurred the following special charges in 2002, 2001 and 2000:

(1)

Excludes the 2000 sale of the Water Products business, which was treated as
a discontinued operation.

Restatement-Related Costs:

In January 1999, we acquired HBO & Company
(“HBOC”), and the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests. In
April 1999, we discovered improper accounting practices at HBOC. In July
1999, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors completed an investigation
into such matters, which resulted in a previously reported restatement of our
historical consolidated financial statements related to HBOC (pre-acquisition)
in 1999, 1998 and 1997. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, we incurred expenses totaling
$2.2 million, $2.5 million and $18.9 million in connection with the
investigation, restatement of the historical consolidated financial statements
and the resulting securities litigation arising out of the restatement. Refer
also to Financial Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities,” on
pages 80 to 88 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Loss (Gain) on Investments, net:

In 2002, we recorded
other-than-temporary impairment losses of $13.7 million on equity and joint
venture investments as a result of significant declines in the market values of
these investments.

In 2001, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $97.8
million comprised of $93.1 million on our WebMD Inc., (“WebMD”) warrants and
$12.5 million on other equity and venture capital investments as a result of
significant declines in the market values of these investments, partially
offset by a $7.8 million gain on the liquidation of another investment. We
also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $23.1 million on
equity investments as a result of significant declines in the market value of
these investments in connection with the restructuring of our former iMcKesson
segment, which is included in our restructuring activities.

In 2000, we recorded gains on investments of $269.1 million, consisting of
$248.7 million for our investment in WebMD stocks and warrants and $20.3
million for other equity investments. We recorded a cumulative net gain of
$155.6 million on our WebMD investment, of which a $93.1 million loss was
recognized in 2001 and a $248.7



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

million gain was recognized in 2000. The events and related accounting
treatment pertaining to these investments are as follows:

In August 1998, January 1999, and April 1999, we made a series of cash
investments in convertible preferred stock for a total of approximately $28
million in WebMD, a private company. As consideration for these investments,
we received exclusivity rights to market our products and services on the WebMD
network, warrants and other rights to purchase common shares of WebMD, and
anti-dilution rights (collectively the “Equity Purchase Rights”). We accounted
for our investments in WebMD at cost, as we owned less than a 10% voting
interest in WebMD.

In order to resolve contractual differences between WebMD and the Company,
in September 1999, McKesson, WebMD and Healtheon Corporation (“Healtheon”) (at that time, WebMD was
contemplating a merger with Healtheon, a public company) entered
into an agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby: various strategic and
product agreements between us and WebMD were terminated; we were obligated to
convert our preferred stock to common stock prior to the Healtheon/WebMD
merger; and all other Equity Purchase Rights that we had under the various
preferred stock investments were terminated.

In exchange for relinquishing our Equity Purchase Rights under the
Settlement Agreement, we received warrants to purchase 8.4 million shares of
Healtheon/WebMD common stock. We did not attribute any value to these warrants
due to the uncertainty still surrounding the Healtheon/WebMD merger and the
related difficulties in providing a reasonable estimate of the value of the
warrants. As a result, no adjustment to the cost basis or gain recognition was
recorded on receipt of the warrants in September 1999.

In November 1999, WebMD completed its merger with Healtheon,
at which time we recognized gains of $93.4 million on the warrants and $168.6
million on the stock based on the market value of our interest in the new
public entity. The merged company’s name was later changed to WebMD.

Subsequent to the Healtheon/WebMD merger, in the third and fourth quarters
of 2000, we donated 250,000 WebMD common shares to the McKesson Foundation and
sold the remaining WebMD common shares to third parties. As a result of these
transactions, we recorded a $9.8 million charge at fair value for the donation
and a loss of $13.3 million from the sale of the WebMD stock.

Since the Healtheon/WebMD merger, we account for our investment in the
WebMD warrants in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.” As we terminated our business relationship
with WebMD, our investment in WebMD was classified as “Available-for-Sale” in
the third quarter of 2000.

Loss on Sales of Businesses, net:

In 2002, we sold two businesses from
our Information Solutions segment and one business from our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment for a total net pre-tax loss of $22.0 million.
In 2000, we sold a software business from our Information Solutions
segment for a pre-tax loss of $9.4 million. The disposition of
this business was part of a 2000 restructuring program.

Restructuring Activities:

In 2002, we recorded net charges for
restructuring activities of $39.8 million, consisting of $14.0 million in
severance costs, $18.2 million in exit costs (costs to prepare facilities for
disposal, and lease costs and property taxes required subsequent to termination
of operations) and $7.6 million related to asset impairments as follows:

•

We recorded severance charges of $19.8 million, exit-related charges of
$19.5 million and asset impairment charges of $7.6 million primarily
related to a plan to close 28 and open seven new distribution centers in
our Medical-Surgical segment, restructuring activities in our European
and U.S. businesses in our Information Solutions segment, and closures
of two distribution centers in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment

.

•

We also reassessed restructuring plans from prior years, and reversed
severance reserves of $5.8 million and exit-related reserves of $1.3
million due to a change in estimated costs to complete these activities.

In connection with 2002 restructuring activities, approximately 920
employees, primarily in distribution, delivery and associated back-office
functions, were given termination notices. We anticipate completing these
restructuring

programs by the end of 2003. As of March 31, 2002, 50 employees had been
terminated, eight distribution centers were closed, and four distribution
centers were opened.

In 2001, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $355.9
million, consisting of $36.6 million in severance costs, $10.1 million in exit
costs and $309.2 million related to asset impairments as follows:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2000, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $232.7
million, consisting of $4.2 million in severance costs, income of $5.7 million
in exit costs, charges of $224.8 million related to asset
impairments and $9.4 million loss on sale of a business.
Restructuring charges in 2000 primarily included the following:

•

As discussed above, in the fourth quarter of 2000, we decided to
reorganize our Information Solutions segment business and product
portfolio and discontinue overlapping or nonstrategic product offerings.
We recorded asset impairments of $232.5 million relating to this program,
which consisted of a $49.1 million write-off of capitalized product
development costs, $39.3 million of purchased software and $50.7 million
of intangible assets associated with discontinued product lines based upon an
analysis of discounted cash flows. In addition, we recorded a $74.1
million allowance for customer settlements associated with pre-July 1999
software contracts. We also recorded a $9.4 million loss on the
sale of a non-core foreign operation, a $7.7 million charge for
uncollectible unbilled receivables and a $2.2 million charge for obsolete
equipment associated with the discontinued products. Substantially all of
these charges were non-cash asset write-offs, except for the customer
settlements. In addition, a charge of $0.6 million was recorded for costs
to prepare the facilities for disposal, lease costs and property taxes
required subsequent to termination of operations and other exit-related
activities.

We recorded a $3.9 million severance charge related to the above activities,
for approximately 300 employees, primarily in product development
and support and administrative functions, who were terminated at the end of
2000.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2000, we reviewed the operations and cost
structure of our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. This resulted in the planned
closure of a sales office and a workforce reduction. We recorded a
charge of $0.6 million for exit-related costs and a severance charge of
$2.3 million relating to the termination of approximately 200 employees,
primarily in warehouse, administration and sales functions.

•

Also in 2000, we reassessed restructuring plans from prior years. This
resulted in decisions to retain one of the six pharmaceutical
distribution centers previously identified for closure, reduce the number
of medical-surgical distribution center closures and close an additional
pharmaceutical distribution center. In connection with these
reassessments, we reversed $6.9 million in exit-related costs and $2.0
million in severance costs, and recorded additional asset impairments of
$1.7 million due to a change in estimated costs to complete these
activities.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

•

We completed the closures of the three pharmaceutical distribution
centers mentioned above. In addition, we realigned our sales
organization and eliminated certain other back-office functions. We also
completed the closures of three medical-surgical distribution centers.

Costs Associated With Former Employees:

In 2000, we recorded charges of
$23.8 million for severance and benefit costs resulting from changes in
executive management. The charges were based on the terms of employment
contracts in place with these executives. In 2002, we reversed $0.8 million of
these severance accruals due to a change in estimate.

Other Operating Items:

Other operating items for 2000 include charges of
$61.8 million in our Information Solutions segment for accounts receivable
allowances and a $6.7 million charge for customer accounts receivable in the
medical management business of our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. In
addition, our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment recorded a charge of $31.5
million for asset impairments and receivables related primarily to a prior year
implementation of a contract system.

Other Charges, net:

In 2002, other charges of $11.6 million primarily
include $7.5 million of inventory and other asset impairments and a $4.0
million legal settlement. Other charges were $2.1 million in 2001. Fiscal
2000 other charges of $21.2 million primarily included a $9.8 million charge
for the donation of 250,000 WebMD warrants to the McKesson Foundation and $7.7
million impairment of a note receivable from a former stockholder of an
acquired company.

Income Taxes on Special Charges:

Income taxes on special charges are
generally recorded at our annual effective tax rate. For accounting purposes,
a tax benefit on the net assets of one of the businesses written down in
connection with the restructuring of our former iMcKesson segment in 2001 was
not recognized until 2002, when the sale of the business was completed. In
addition, in 2002, we sold a business for a pre-tax loss of $2.7 million and an
after-tax gain of $4.3 million.

Additional information regarding our special charges is as follows:

Refer to Financial Notes 4 and 5, “Special Charges” and “Restructuring and
Related Asset Impairments,” on pages 58 to 64 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for further discussions regarding our special charges.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a
significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results
of operations, and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates
based on past experience and management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty
inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Below are those policies that we believe are critical to the understanding of
our operating results and financial condition. For additional accounting
policies, see Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” on pages 54
to 57 of the consolidated financial statements.

In extending credit terms as well as recording allowances against
receivable balances, we use a substantial amount of judgment and estimates
regarding the credit-worthiness of our customers. As of March 31, 2002, total
trade and notes receivable, and other customer financing was $4,099.3 million
and $212.6 million, prior to allowances of $319.5
million. Other customer financing relates to guarantees provided to our
customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories, lease
and credit financing. As the financial condition of our customers change,
these allowances are adjusted. We continuously assess and estimate the
collectibility of our receivables and other customer financing and establish
allowances for those accounts where collection may be in doubt.

In 2001 and 2000, we
recorded a total of $235.2 million for estimated customer
settlements as a result of our decision to discontinue overlapping and
nonstrategic products and product development projects to redesign or
stabilize several go-forward projects within our Information Solutions
segment. These estimates have been developed using a customer and product
specific approach, based on numerous interactions between our customers and us.
The determination and quantification of our liabilities along with the
assessment of an appropriate reserve for uncollectible accounts is an on-going
process and we are still actively engaged in settlement discussions with
affected customers.

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. Inventories for our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale with
the majority of the cost of domestic inventories determined on the last-in
first-out (“LIFO”) method and international inventories stated at average cost.
Information Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with
cost determined either by the specific identification or first-in, first-out
(“FIFO”) method. Valuations are based on estimated future demand and market
conditions, changes to which could require the recognition of impairments to
inventory.

We have significant intangible assets which include goodwill and other
purchased intangibles. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” on April 1, 2001 we perform an annual impairment
test on goodwill balances and we review the estimated lives of our other
intangible assets. An impairment test requires that we determine the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the fair values of the
assets. Fair values can be determined using either discounted cash flows or
third party valuations. An impairment loss is recorded if the carrying value
exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows from operations. Changes in market
conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates, which
may require future adjustments to the carrying value of these assets.

We use the percentage of completion method of accounting for the
recognition of certain revenues, primarily within our Information
Solutions’
segment. This method of accounting requires the use of estimates, including
the assessment of achieving milestones, costs as of each period end, and costs
to complete the revenue process. These estimates can change significantly
throughout the period of the contract. Changes in estimates to complete, and
revisions in overall profit estimates on percentage of completion contracts,
are recognized in the period in which they are determined.

We are involved in a number of lawsuits regarding the restatement of our
1999 historical financial statements. We do not believe it is feasible to
predict or determine the outcome or resolution of these proceedings, or to
estimate the amount of, or potential range of, loss with respect to these
proceedings. In addition, the timing of the final resolution of these
proceedings is uncertain. The range of possible resolutions of these
proceedings could include judgments against us or settlements that could
require substantial payments by us that could cause us to incur material



McKESSON CORPORATION

losses which could have a material impact on our financial condition and
results of operations. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, we incurred expenses totaling
$2.2 million, $2.5 million and $18.9 million in connection with the restatement
of the historical consolidated financial statements and the resulting
securities litigation arising out of the restatement.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash flow from operating activities was $329.3 million in 2002,
compared with $332.3 million in 2001 and a use of cash of $314.8 million in
2000. Net cash flow from operating activities reflects the build-up associated
with the implementation of new pharmaceutical distribution agreements and other
sales growth, as well as purchasing opportunities. The working capital
increase in 2001 also reflects the timing of vendor payments, partially offset
by the payment of income taxes on the gain on sale of the Water Products
business that was sold in late 2000.

Net cash used by investing activities in 2002 was $386.8 million, compared
with $322.0 million in 2001 and a source of cash of $553.6 million in 2000.
Investing activities in 2002 include an increase in expenditures for
capitalized software reflecting our investment in both software developed for
internal use and for resale, offset by a decrease in property acquisitions.
Fiscal 2000 investing activities include the sale of our Water Products
business for $1.1 billion in cash, which enabled us to reduce short-term
borrowings and add to our cash and marketable securities.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $181.7 million in 2002,
compared to a use of cash of $125.5 million in 2001 and a source of cash of
$76.4 million in 2000. On January 24, 2002, we completed a public offering of
$400.0 million of 7.75% unsecured notes, due 2012. These notes are redeemable
at any time, in whole or in part, at our option. Net proceeds from the
issuance of these notes were used to repay $175.0 million of term debt in March
2002 and for other general corporate purposes. In February 2000, we completed
a private placement of $335 million in term debt, the proceeds of which were
also used to retire term debt and for other general corporate purposes.
Financing activities also include our stock repurchase program that commenced
in 2001 and which allows us to purchase up to $250 million of shares of our
common stock in open market or private transactions. In 2002 and 2001, we
repurchased 1.2 million and 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $44.2
million and $65.6 million.

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in
operating working capital (receivables and inventories net of related
payables). Operating working capital is susceptible to large variations during
the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.
Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, new customer
build-up requirements and the desired level of investment inventory.
Consolidated operating working capital at March 31, 2002 was greater than the
prior year, primarily reflecting the additional build-up requirements for new
distribution agreements. Operating working capital at March 31, 2001 was flat
relative to 2000. No trade receivables were sold at the end of each of the
last three years. The improvement in the operating working capital ratio in
2001 is due to an increase in days sales outstanding in payables reflecting
purchases made late in the year and the timing of vendor payments.

The ratio of net debt to net capital employed at March 31, 2002 was down
slightly from March 31, 2001. This ratio increased at March 31, 2001 from the
prior year, primarily reflecting the increase in net debt to fund internal
growth. March 31, 2000 balances also benefited from the February 2000 proceeds
from the sale of the Water Products business. Return on committed
capital improved to 21.8% in 2002 from 18.8% in 2001, reflecting a growth in
our operating profit in excess of the growth in the working capital to fund the
increase in revenues. Return on committed capital for 2001 was
slightly lower than for 2000.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The table below presents our significant contractual obligations and
commitments at March 31, 2002 and those commitments under our Verispan joint
venture agreement:

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions
under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of inventory at a discount in the
event that customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial
institutions. Among other limitations, these inventories must be in resalable
condition. We have also guaranteed credit facilities and the payment of leases
for certain customers. As of March 31, 2002, these customer guarantees
approximated $103.9 million for the repurchase of inventories and $108.7
million for the repayment of credit facilities and lease obligations.

Credit Resources

Working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash, short-term
borrowings and our receivables sale facility. We have a 364-day revolving
credit agreement that allows for short-term borrowings of up to $1.075 billion
which expires in October 2002, and a $400.0 million five-year revolving credit
facility which expires in October 2003. These facilities are primarily
intended to support our commercial paper borrowings. We also have a committed
revolving receivables sale facility aggregating $850 million,
which we intend to renew on or before June 14, 2002. At March 31, 2002, we
had no short-term borrowings, no borrowings under the revolving credit
facilities, and no borrowing equivalents under the revolving receivables sale
facility. We anticipate renewing our 364-day revolving credit
facility prior to its expiration.

Our senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s are currently
BBB, BBB and Baa2, and our commercial paper ratings are currently A-2, F-2, and
P-2. Our ratings are on a negative credit outlook. Our various borrowing
facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal
debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we
exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit
facility and $335.0 million of term debt could be accelerated. At March 31,
2002, this ratio was 25.7% and we were in compliance with our other financial
covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings or the lack of compliance with
our covenants could result in a negative impact on our ability to finance our
operations through our credit facilities, as well as the issuance of additional
debt at the interest rates then currently available.

Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements
are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flows from operations,
existing credit sources and other capital market transactions.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

MARKET RISKS

Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas
our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying
weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed
by 50 basis points in 2002, interest expense would not have been materially
different from that reported.

As of March 31, 2002, the aggregate fair values of our long-term debt and
convertible preferred securities were $1,465.5 million and $220.0 million.
Each preferred security is convertible at the rate of 1.3418 shares of our
stock, subject to certain circumstances. Fair values were estimated on the
basis of quoted market prices, although trading in these debt securities is
limited and may not reflect fair value. Fair values are subject to
fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value
of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar
terms.

We conduct business in Canada, Mexico, France, the Netherlands, Ireland,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and we are
subject to foreign currency exchange risk on cash flows related to sales,
expenses, financing and investment transactions. If exchange rates on such
currencies were to fluctuate 10%, we believe that our results from operations
and cash flows would not be materially affected. Aggregate foreign exchange
translation gains and losses included in operations, comprehensive income and
equity are discussed in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies”, on
pages 54 to 57 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES

We have outstanding notes receivable from certain of our current and
former officers and senior managers totaling $85.5 million, $90.7 million and
$94.5 million at March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 related to purchases of common
stock under our various employee stock purchase plans. Such notes were issued
for amounts equal to the market value of the stock on the date of the purchase
and are full recourse to the borrower. As of March 31, 2002, the value of the
underlying stock collateral was $55.8 million. The notes bear interest at
rates ranging from 2.7% to 8.0% and are due at various dates through February
2005. Other transactions with related parties for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were not
considered material.

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, management’s discussion and
analysis includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)
and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”). Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by
use of forward-looking words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” or
“estimates,” or the negative of these words, or other comparable terminology.
The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans or intentions may also
include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such
risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed under “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” The
reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all
potential risks and uncertainties.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described herein or in our
other public documents. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to
these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following additional factors may affect our future results:

Adverse resolution of pending litigation regarding the restatement of our
historical financial statements may cause us to incur material losses.

Subsequent to our April 28, 1999 restatement of financial results
announcement, and as of May 10, 2002, 91 lawsuits have been filed against us,
certain of our current or former officers or directors, or those of HBOC, and
other defendants. In addition, the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Northern District of California and the San Francisco District Office of the
SEC have also commenced investigations in connection with the matters relating
to the restatement of previously reported amounts.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of these proceedings, or to estimate the amount of, or potential
range of, loss with respect to these proceedings. In addition, the timing of
the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain. The range of possible
resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against us or
settlements that could require substantial payments by us, which could cause us
to incur material losses.

Changes in the United States healthcare environment could have a material
negative impact on our revenues and net income.

Our products and services are intended to function within the structure of
the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the
United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has changed
significantly in an effort to reduce costs. These changes include increased
use of managed care, cuts in Medicare reimbursement levels, consolidation of
pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors, and the development of
large, sophisticated purchasing groups.

We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in
the future. Some of these changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding
of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations
governing the privacy of patient information, or the delivery or pricing of
pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause
healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products
and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our
products and services.

Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing, selling or distribution
policies could also significantly reduce our revenues and net income. Due to
the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information
technology products and services that we offer, such changes may adversely
impact us, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower
range of products and services.

Healthcare trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase
over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents.
In recent years, our revenues and gross margins have increased from our generic
drug offering programs. An increase or a decrease in the availability of these
generic drugs could have a material impact on our net income.

Substantial defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of our
products by large customers could have a significant negative impact on our
financial condition and results of operations and liquidity.

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with
a limited number of large customers. During the year ended March 31, 2002,
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55% of our total
revenues. Sales to our largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented
approximately 14% of our 2002 revenues. As a result, our sales and credit
concentration have significantly increased. Any defaults in payment or a



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

material reduction in purchases from us by these large customers could
have a significant negative impact on our financial condition, results of
operations and liquidity.

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions and
Medical-Surgical Solutions segments are dependent upon sophisticated
information systems. The malfunction or failure of these systems for any
extended period of time could adversely affect our business.

We rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain,
rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: facilitate the purchase
and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution
centers; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis, manage the
accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and process
payments to suppliers. Our business and results of operations may be
materially adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by
unforeseen events, or fail for any extended period of time.

The ability of our Information Solutions business to attract and retain
customers due to challenges in integrating software products and technological
advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Our Information Solutions business delivers enterprise-wide patient care,
clinical, financial, managed care, payor and strategic management software
solutions, as well as networking technologies, electronic commerce, outsourcing
and other services to healthcare organizations throughout the United States and
certain foreign countries. Challenges in integrating Information Solutions
software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and
may reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead
to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the
products and services offered by our Information Solutions business. Such
technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services
or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure. The success of our
Information Solutions business will depend, in part, on its ability to be
responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing
business models. To remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information
systems marketplace, our Information Solutions business must develop new
products on a timely basis. The failure to develop competitive products and to
introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our
Information Solutions business to attract and retain customers and thereby
significantly reduce our net income.

Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and proprietary rights
may infringe on the rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark
laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to
protect our proprietary rights to our products. There can be no assurance that
these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not
independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technology. Although we believe that our products and other
proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third
parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims
against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement claims against us in the future. Additionally, we may find it
necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our
patent, copyright and trademark rights, and to determine the scope and validity
of the proprietary rights of others. These types of litigation can be costly
and time consuming. These litigation expenses, or any damage payments
resulting from adverse determinations of third party claims, could be
significant and result in material losses to us.

Potential product liability claims arising from healthcare information
technology business products could result in material losses to us.

We provide products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to
patient medical histories and treatment plans. If these products fail to
provide accurate and timely information, customers could assert liability
claims against us. Litigation with respect to liability claims, regardless of
the outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management’s
attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. We
attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages from negligence,
errors or mistakes. Despite this precaution, the limitations of liability set
forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us
from liability for damages.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for
errors and omissions. However, this coverage may not continue to be available
on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one
or more large claims against us. In addition, the insurer might disclaim
coverage as to any future claim.

System errors and warranties in Information Solutions segment’s products could
cause unforeseen liabilities.

Our Information Solutions segment’s systems are very complex. As with
complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially
when first introduced. Our Information Solutions business systems are intended
to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care.
Therefore, users of our products have a greater sensitivity to system errors
than the market for software products generally. Failure of a client’s system
to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of
warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the
system comply with the documentation. If such failure is not remedied in a
timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing
the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid,
or assert claims for significant damages.

Potential regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of
Information Solutions products as medical devices could impose increased costs,
delay the introduction of new products and negatively impact our business.

The FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer
software intended for use in the healthcare industry. The FDA has increasingly
focused on the regulation of computer products and computer-assisted products
as medical devices under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If the FDA
chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose
extensive requirements upon us. If we fail to comply with the applicable
requirements, the FDA could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil
penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production,
refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and
initiating criminal prosecution. Any final FDA policy governing computer
products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing
products or may prevent us from marketing our products.

New and potential federal regulations relating to patient confidentiality could
depress the demand for our Information Solutions products and impose
significant product redesign costs on us.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and
the circumstances under which those records may be released. These regulations
govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record
information and may require the users of such information to implement
specified security measures. Regulations governing electronic health data
transmissions are evolving rapidly and are often unclear and difficult to
apply.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA,
requires national standards for some types of electronic health information
transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, standards to
ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and national
health data privacy legislation or regulations. In December 2000, final health
data privacy regulations were published that will require healthcare
organizations to be in compliance by April 2003.

Evolving HIPAA-related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of
our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information. This could
adversely affect demand for our products and force product re-design in order
to meet the requirements of any new regulations and protect the privacy and
integrity of patient data. We may need to expend significant capital, research
and development and other resources to modify our products to address these
evolving data security and privacy issues.

Due to the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our Information
Solutions segment, our future operating results may suffer if a significant
number of our customers delay implementation.

Our Information Solutions segment has long sales and implementation cycles
which could range from several months to over two years or more from initial
contact with the customer to completion of implementation. How and when to
implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business
processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. Furthermore, the
solutions we provide typically require significant capital



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

expenditures and time commitments by the customer. Any decision by our
customers to delay implementation may adversely affect our revenues.

Reduced capacity in the commercial property insurance market exposes us to
potential loss.

In order to provide prompt and complete service to our major
Pharmaceutical Solutions customers, we maintain significant product inventory
at certain of our distribution centers. While we seek to maintain property
insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, available coverage
limits have recently decreased while the costs of such insurance have escalated
sharply. There can be no assurance that our property insurance will be
adequate or available on acceptable terms, if at all. Unless
otherwise mitigated by contractual provisions, one or more large
casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster could
exceed our coverage limits, and could expose us to losses which would
materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate
acquisitions successfully.

An element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate
acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. Integration of
acquisitions involves a number of risks, including the diversion of
management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we
have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and
the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and
retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; challenges in retaining
the customers of the combined businesses; and potential adverse effects on
operating results. If we are unable to successfully complete and integrate
strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth
strategies could be negatively affected.

The Stockholders and Board of Directors of

McKesson Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the years then ended. Our audits also included the
supplementary consolidated financial statement schedule listed in Item 14(a).
These consolidated financial statements and supplementary consolidated
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and supplementary consolidated financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
at March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the years then ended are in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, based on our audits, such supplementary consolidated financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Financial Note 19 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company is involved in certain shareholder litigation related
to HBO & Company and subsidiaries.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations.

The consolidated financial statements of McKesson
Corporation (“McKesson,” the “Company,” or “we” and other similar pronouns)
include the financial statements of all majority-owned companies. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

We conduct our business through three operating segments: Pharmaceutical
Solutions, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Information Solutions. The
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment includes our U.S. and Canadian pharmaceutical
and healthcare products distribution businesses and a 22% equity interest in a
pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Solutions
business also includes the manufacture and sale of automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems for hospitals and retail pharmacists, medical management
services and tools to payors and providers, marketing and other support
services to pharmaceutical manufacturers, consulting and outsourcing services
to pharmacies, and distribution of first-aid products to industrial and
commercial customers. The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distributes
medical-surgical supplies and equipment, and provides logistics and related
services within the U.S. The Information Solutions segment delivers
enterprise-wide patient care, clinical, financial, supply chain, managed care
and strategic management software solutions, as well as outsourcing and other
services, to healthcare organizations throughout the U.S. and certain foreign
countries.

The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless
otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall
mean the Company’s fiscal year.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

include all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale

are carried at fair value and the
net unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in
marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders’
equity.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories for
the Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments consist of merchandise held for resale
with the majority of the cost of domestic inventories determined on the last-in
first-out (“LIFO”) method and international inventories stated at average cost.
Information Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with
cost determined either by the specific identification or first-in, first-out
(“FIFO”) method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

is stated at cost and depreciated on the
straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of properties
over estimated service lives ranging from one to 50 years.

Capitalized Software Held for Sale

consists of development costs for
software held for sale for our Information Solutions segment. Such costs are
capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological feasibility.
Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general
availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life
of three years. We monitor the net realizable value of capitalized software
development investments to ensure that the investment will be recovered through
future sales.

We capitalized software development costs held for sale of $48.0 million,
$39.3 million and $54.5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Amortization of
capitalized software held for sale totaled $37.2 million, $31.8 million and
$32.2 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000. Royalty fees of $20.8 million, $17.9
million and $18.2 million, were expensed in 2002, 2001 and 2000, for software
provided by third-party business partners.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Long-lived Assets.

We assess the recoverability of goodwill on an annual
basis and other long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets, including goodwill,
that we expect to hold and use is based on estimated fair values of the assets.
Estimates of fair values are based on quoted market prices, when available,
the results of valuation techniques utilizing discounted cash flows (using the
lowest level of identifiable cash flows) or fundamental analysis. Long-lived
assets to be disposed of, either by sale or abandonment, are reported at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use

is amortized over estimated
useful lives ranging from one to 10 years and is included in other assets in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, capitalized software held for internal use was $224.3 million, $139.8
million and $95.5 million, net of accumulated amortization of $99.0 million,
$90.3 million, and $18.5 million.

Insurance Programs.

Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain
coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required to be
insured by law or contract. It is our policy to retain a significant portion
of certain losses related primarily to workers’ compensation and comprehensive
general, product, and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under
these programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability
for claims incurred. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial assumptions
followed in the insurance industry.

Revenue Recognition

. Revenues for our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment
are recognized when products are shipped or services are provided to customers.
Included in these revenues are large volume sales of pharmaceuticals to major
self-warehousing drugstore chains whereby we act as an intermediary in the
order and subsequent delivery of products directly from the manufacturer to the
customers’ warehouses. These sales totaled $13.2 billion in 2002, $10.7
billion in 2001 and $8.7 billion in 2000.

Revenues for our Information Solutions segment are generated primarily by
licensing software systems (consisting of software, hardware and maintenance
support), and providing outsourcing and professional services. Software
systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service
agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of
delivery or under the percentage of completion contract method in accordance
with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition”
and SOP 81-1 “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Product-Type Contracts,” based on the terms and conditions in the contract.
Changes in estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on
percentage of completion contracts are recognized in the period in which they
are determined. Hardware is generally recognized upon delivery. Multi-year
software license agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the
agreement. Implementation fees are recognized as the work is performed or
under the percentage of completion contract method. Maintenance and support
agreements are marketed under annual or multiyear agreements and are recognized
ratably over the period covered by the agreements. Remote processing services
are recognized monthly as the service is performed. Outsourcing services are
recognized as the service is performed.

We also offer our products on an application service provider (“ASP”)
basis, making available our software functionality on a remote processing basis
from our data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative
support as well as processing services. Revenue on products sold on an ASP
basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract.

Other Income, net

includes interest income of $23.8 million, $29.1 million
and $21.7 million and our share in the net income from investments accounted
for under the equity method of accounting of $6.3 million, $5.9 million and
$18.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Income Taxes

. We account for income taxes under the liability method,
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

. Assets and liabilities of our foreign
affiliates are translated at current exchange rates, while revenue and expenses
are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments related to our foreign operations are reported as a component of
stockholders’ equity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

. Derivative financial instruments are
used principally in the management of our foreign currency exposures.
Financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value
of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated
as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are
recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged item
affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash
flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative
instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each
accounting period with the results included in income (loss).

Employee Stock Options

. We use the intrinsic value method to account for
stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

New Accounting Pronouncements

. On April 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended in June 2000 by SFAS No. 138,
“Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,”
which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
and for hedging activities. These statements require that we recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure these instruments at fair value. The adoption of this
accounting standard did not materially impact our consolidated financial
statements.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” which eliminated the pooling method of
accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other
intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We adopted this
accounting standard for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for
the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for
goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. This
accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately disclosed from other
intangible assets in the statement of financial position, and no longer be
amortized but tested for impairment at least annually. We adopted SFAS No. 142
on April 1, 2001 and, as required by this pronouncement, during the year, we
completed the transitional and annual impairment tests and we did not record
any impairments of goodwill.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of
goodwill effective April 1, 2001. A reconciliation of previously reported net
income (loss) and earnings (loss) per common share to the amounts adjusted for
the exclusion of goodwill amortization net of the related income tax effect
follows:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting requirements for
retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. SFAS No.
143 is effective for 2004. We are evaluating what impact, if any, SFAS No. 143
may have on the consolidated financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” that replaces SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of.” SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale, including those of discontinued operations, be measured at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported
in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. Discontinued
operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include
amounts for operating losses that have not yet been incurred. SFAS No. 144
also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all
components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest
of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
entity in a disposal transaction. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective
for 2003 and are generally to be applied prospectively. The adoption of this
accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In January 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the FASB,
reached a consensus on Issue 01-14, “Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for “Out-of-Pocket” Expenses
incurred.” EITF Issue
01-14 requires that amounts billed to customers for out-of-pocket expenses be
recorded as revenue and not as a reduction of expenses. We historically
recorded these items as a reduction of our cost of sales. We adopted the
provisions of EITF Issue 01-14 in the fourth quarter of 2002. These
reclassifications had no material impact to our consolidated financial
statements.

2. Acquisitions and Investments

We made the following acquisitions and investments over the last three
years:

Pro forma results of operations for these business acquisitions have not
been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated
financial statements on either an individual or aggregate basis.

Subsequent to year end, on May 2, 2002, we entered into an agreement to
acquire A.L.I. Technologies Inc. (“A.L.I.”), of Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada, by means of a cash tender offer for CN$43.50 per share, or about CN$530
million (approximately US$340 million). A.L.I. provides medical imaging
solutions which are



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

designed to streamline access to diagnostic information, automate clinical
workflow and eliminate the need for film. The acquisition is expected to close
in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, and is subject to regulatory approval and
other customary conditions.

In addition, on May 17, 2002, the Company and Quintiles Transnational
Corporation formed a joint venture, Verispan, L.L.C. (“Verispan”). Verispan is
a provider of patient-level data delivered in near real time as well as a
supplier of other healthcare information. We have an approximate 46% equity
interest in the joint venture. The initial contribution to the joint venture
of $12.1 million consisted of $7.7 million in net assets from a Pharmaceutical
Solutions’ business and $4.4 million in cash, and is subject to adjustment. We
have also committed to provide additional aggregate cash contributions of $9.4
million and to purchase a total of $15.0 million in services from the joint
venture through 2007.

3. Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

In February 2000, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Water
Products Company (the “Water Products business”), to Groupe Danone for
approximately $1.1 billion in cash. All of the results of operations and net
assets of the Water Products business have been classified as discontinued
operations and all prior years restated accordingly. Fiscal 2001 results
primarily include an adjustment to the gain on discontinued operations for the
Water Products business. Results of discontinued operations were as follows:

The net assets of the discontinued operations were not material to our
2002, 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial position.

In 2002,
we sold three businesses, Abaton.com, Inc., Amysis Managed Care
Systems, Inc. and ProDental Corporation. Two of these businesses were from
our Information Solutions segment and one was from our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment. Net proceeds from the sale of these businesses were $0.2 million,
resulting in a pre-tax loss of $22.0 million and an after-tax gain of $22.0
million. For accounting purposes, the net assets of one of these businesses
were written down in 2001 in connection with the restructuring of the former
iMcKesson segment. The tax benefit could not be recognized until 2002, when
the sale of the business was completed.

In 2000, we sold a
software business, Imnet France S.A.R.L., for net proceeds of $0.8 million.
The disposition resulted in a pre-tax and after-tax loss of
$9.4 million and $5.6 million.

4. Special Charges

We incurred the following special charges in 2002, 2001 and 2000:



Restatement-Related Costs:

In January 1999, we acquired HBO & Company
(“HBOC”) and the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests. In
April 1999, we discovered improper accounting practices at HBOC (See Financial
Note 19). In July 1999, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors
completed an investigation into such matters, which resulted in a previously
reported restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements
related to HBOC (pre-acquisition) in 1999, 1998 and 1997. In 2002, 2001 and
2000, we incurred expenses totaling $2.2 million, $2.5 million and $18.9
million in connection with the investigation, restatement of the historical
consolidated financial statements and the resulting securities litigation
arising out of the restatement.

Loss (Gain) on Investments, net:

In 2002, we recorded
other-than-temporary impairment losses of $13.7 million on equity and venture
capital investments as a result of significant declines in the market values of
these investments.

In 2001, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $97.8
million comprised of $93.1 million on our WebMD Inc., (“WebMD”) warrants and
$12.5 million on other equity and venture capital investments as a result of
significant declines in the market values of these investments, partially
offset by a $7.8 million gain on the liquidation of another investment. We
also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $23.1 million on
equity investments as a result of significant declines in the market value of
these investments in connection with the restructuring of our former iMcKesson
segment, which is included in our restructuring activities.

In 2000, we recorded gains on investments of $269.1 million, consisting of
$248.7 million for our investment in WebMD stocks and warrants and $20.3
million for other equity investments. Between 2001 and 2000, we recorded a
cumulative net gain of $155.6 million on our WebMD investments of which a $93.1
million loss was recognized in 2001 and a $248.7 million gain was recognized in
2000. The events and related accounting treatment pertaining to these
investments are as follows:

In August 1998, January 1999, and April 1999, we made a series of cash
investments in convertible preferred stock for a total of approximately $28
million in WebMD, a private company. As consideration for these investments,
we received exclusivity rights to market our products and services on the WebMD
network, warrants and other rights to purchase common shares of WebMD, and
anti-dilution rights (collectively the “Equity Purchase Rights”). We accounted
for our investments in WebMD at cost, as we owned less than a 10% voting
interest in WebMD.

In order to resolve contractual differences between WebMD and the Company,
in September 1999, McKesson, WebMD and Healtheon Corporation
(“Healtheon”) (at that time, WebMD was
contemplating a merger with Healtheon, a public company) entered
into an agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby various strategic and
product



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

agreements between us and WebMD were terminated; we were obligated to
convert our preferred stock to common stock prior to the Healtheon/WebMD
merger; and all other Equity Purchase Rights that we had under the various
preferred stock investments were terminated.

In exchange for relinquishing our Equity Purchase Rights under the
Settlement Agreement, we received warrants to purchase 8.4 million shares of
Healtheon/WebMD common stock. We did not attribute any value to these warrants
due to the uncertainty still surrounding the Healtheon/WebMD merger and the
related difficulties in providing a reasonable estimate of the value of the
warrants. As a result, no adjustment to the cost basis or gain recognition was
recorded on receipt of the warrants in September 1999.

In November 1999, WebMD completed its merger with Healtheon,
at which time we recognized gains of $93.4 million on the warrants and $168.6
million on the stock based on the market value of our interest in the new
public entity. The merged company’s name was later changed to WebMD.

Subsequent to the Healtheon/WebMD merger, in the third and fourth quarters
of 2000, we donated 250,000 WebMD common shares to the McKesson Foundation and
sold the remaining WebMD common shares to third parties. As a result of these
transactions, we recorded a $9.8 million charge at fair value for the donation
and a loss of $13.3 million from the sale of the WebMD stock.

Since the Healtheon/WebMD merger, we account for our investment in the
WebMD warrants in accordance with SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.” As we terminated our business relationship
with WebMD, our investment in WebMD was classified as “Available-for-Sale” in
the third quarter of 2000.

Costs Associated With Former Employees:

In 2000, we recorded charges of
$23.8 million for severance and benefit costs resulting from changes in
executive management. The charges were based on the terms of employment
contracts in place with these executives. In 2002, we reversed $0.8 million of
these severance accruals due to a change in estimate.

Other Operating Items:

In 2000, other operating items include charges of
$61.8 million in our Information Solutions segment for accounts receivable
allowances and a $6.7 million charge for customer accounts receivable in the
medical management business of our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. In
addition, our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment recorded a charge of $31.5
million for asset impairments and receivables related primarily to a prior year
implementation of a contract system.

Other Charges, net:

In 2002, other charges of $11.6 million primarily
include $7.5 million of inventory and other asset impairments and a $4.0
million legal settlement. Other charges were $2.1 million in 2001. Fiscal
2000 other charges of $21.2 million primarily included a $9.8 million charge
for the donation of 250,000 WebMD warrants to the McKesson Foundation and $7.7
million impairment of a note receivable from a former stockholder of an
acquired company.

Income Taxes on Special Charges:

Income taxes on special charges are
generally recorded at our annual effective tax rate. For accounting purposes,
a tax benefit on the net assets of one of the businesses written down in
connection with the restructuring of our former iMcKesson segment in 2001 was
not recognized until 2002, when the sale of the business was completed. In
addition, in 2002, we sold a business for a pre-tax loss of $2.7 million and an
after-tax gain of $4.3 million.

To reflect the items discussed above, these charges were recorded within
the consolidated statements of operations, as follows:

A description of the restructuring and asset impairment charges for the
three years ended March 31, 2002 is as follows:

Fiscal 2002

In 2002, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $39.8
million, consisting of $14.0 million in severance costs, $18.2 million in exit
costs (costs to prepare facilities for disposal, and lease costs and property
taxes required subsequent to termination of operations) and $7.6 million
related to asset impairments as follows:

•

We recorded severance charges of $19.8 million, exit-related charges of
$19.5 million and asset impairment charges of $7.6 million primarily
related to a plan to close 28 and open seven new distribution centers in
our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, restructuring activities in our
European and U.S. businesses in our Information Solutions segment, and
closures of two distribution centers in our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment.

•

We also reassessed restructuring plans from prior years, and reversed
severance reserves of $5.8 million and exit-related reserves of $1.3
million due to a change in estimated costs to complete these activities.

In connection with 2002 restructuring activities, approximately 920
employees, primarily in distribution, delivery and associated back-office
functions, were given termination notices. We anticipate completing these
restructuring programs by the end of 2003. As of March 31, 2002, 50 employees
had been terminated, eight distribution centers were closed, and four
distribution centers were opened.

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Fiscal 2001

In 2001, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $355.9
million, consisting of $36.6 million in severance costs, $10.1 million in exit
costs and $309.2 million related to asset impairments as follows:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Fiscal 2000

In 2000, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $232.7
million, consisting of $4.2 million in severance costs, income of $5.7 million
in exit costs, charges of $224.8 million related to asset
impairments, and $9.4 million loss on sale of business.
Restructuring charges in 2000 primarily included the following:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The following table summarizes the activity related to the restructuring
liabilities for the three years ending March 31, 2002:

Accrued restructuring liabilities are included in “other liabilities” in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balances at March
31, 2002 for the Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical
Solutions segments relate
primarily to the consolidation of certain distribution centers including
severance, costs for preparing facilities for disposal, lease costs and
property taxes required subsequent to termination of operations. Restructuring
liabilities for the Information Solutions segment primarily represent accrued
severance and contract liabilities. Corporate accrued severance primarily
pertains to retirement costs. With the exception of the retirement costs,
which are anticipated to be paid over several years, substantially all other
accrued restructuring amounts are anticipated to be paid by the end of 2003.

6. Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Trade receivables subject us to a concentration of credit risk with
customers in the retail and institutional sectors. A significant proportion of
the increase in sales has been to a limited number of large customers and as a
result, our credit concentration has increased. Accordingly, any defaults in
payment by these large customers could have a significant negative impact on
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. At March 31,
2002, receivables from our ten largest customers accounted for approximately
41% of total customer accounts receivable. Fiscal 2002 sales to, and March 31,
2002 receivables from, our largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented
approximately 14% of consolidated sales and 10% of consolidated customer
accounts receivable. No other customers represented greater than 10% of
consolidated sales or customer accounts receivable.

At March 31, 2002, we had an $850 million committed receivables sales
facility which was fully available. The program qualifies for sale treatment
under SFAS No. 140, “Accounting For Transfers and Servicing Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” Sales are recorded at the estimated fair
values of the receivables sold,

reflecting discounts for the time value of money based on U.S. commercial paper
rates and estimated loss provisions.

We have provided financing arrangements to certain of our customers within
the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, some of which are on a revolving basis.
At March 31, 2002, a total of approximately $289.2 million was outstanding
and was reflected as other receivables and notes receivable on the consolidated
balance sheet. Under the terms of the financing arrangements, we have a
security interest in the customers’ assets.

We have also provided financing to certain customers in the form of
guarantees to third parties. We have agreements with certain of our customers’
financial institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of
inventory at a discount in the event that customers are unable to meet certain
obligations to those financial institutions. Among other limitations, these
inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also guaranteed credit
facilities and the payment of leases for certain customers. As at March 31,
2002, these guarantees approximated $103.9 million for the repurchase of
inventories and $108.7 million for the repayment of credit facilities and lease
obligations. The expiration of these guarantees are as follows: $26.8 million,
$25.8 million, $22.1 million, $2.4 million, and $42.1 million from 2003 through
2007, and $93.4 million thereafter.

We have a 364-day revolving credit agreement that allows for short-term
borrowings of up to $1.075 billion and which expires in October 2002, and a
$400.0 million five-year revolving credit facility which expires in October
2003. These facilities are primarily intended to support our commercial paper
borrowings. We also have a committed revolving receivables sale facility
aggregating $850 million, which we intend to renew on or before June
14, 2002. At March 31, 2002, we had no short-term borrowings, no borrowings
under the revolving credit facilities, and no borrowing equivalents under the
revolving receivables sale facility.

On January 24, 2002, we completed a public offering of $400.0 million of
7.75% unsecured notes, due in 2012. These notes are redeemable at any time, in
whole or in part, at our option. Net proceeds of $397.3 million for the
issuance of these notes was used to repay term debt and for other general
corporate purposes. In 2000, we issued the Series A, B and C senior fixed-rate
notes totaling $335.0 million of which the net proceeds were used to repay term
debt and for other general corporate purposes.

ESOP related debt (see Note 15), bears interest at rates ranging from 8.6%
fixed rate to approximately 89% of LIBOR or LIBOR plus 0.4% and is due in
semi-annual and annual installments through 2009.

Our various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain
covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio, which
cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding
under the revolving credit facility and $335.0 million of term debt could be
accelerated. At March 31, 2002, this ratio was 25.7% and we were in compliance
with our other financial covenants.

Aggregate annual payments on long-term debt, including capital lease
obligations, for the years ending March 31, are as follows: $141.2 million in
2003, $15.8 million in 2004, $261.6 million in 2005, $8.4 million in 2006,
$28.7 million in 2006 and $973.9 million thereafter.

12. Convertible Preferred Securities

In February 1997, our wholly-owned subsidiary trust issued 4 million
shares of preferred securities to the public and 123,720 common securities to
us, which are convertible at the holder’s option into McKesson Corporation
common stock. The proceeds of such issuances were invested by the trust in
$206,186,000 aggregate principal amount of our 5% Convertible Junior
Subordinated Debentures due 2027 (the “Debentures”). The Debentures represent
the sole assets of the trust. The Debentures mature on June 1, 2027, bear
interest at the rate of 5%, payable quarterly, and are redeemable by us at
102.5% of the principal amount.

Holders of the securities are entitled to cumulative cash distributions at
an annual rate of 5% of the liquidation amount of $50 per security. Each
preferred security is convertible at the rate of 1.3418 shares of McKesson
Corporation common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The
preferred securities will be redeemed upon repayment of the Debentures and are
callable by us at 102.5% of the liquidation amount.

We have guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other
payments due on the preferred securities (the “Guarantee”). The Guarantee,
when taken together with our obligations under the Debentures, and in the
indenture pursuant to which the Debentures were issued, and our obligations
under the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust governing the subsidiary
trust, provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the
preferred securities.

The Debentures and related trust investment in the Debentures have been
eliminated in consolidation and the preferred securities reflected as
outstanding in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

13. Lease Obligations

We lease facilities and equipment under both capital and operating leases.
Net assets held under capital leases included in property, plant and equipment
were $11.2 million, $13.7 million and $9.1 million at March 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000. Amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation expense.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Future minimum lease payments and sublease rental income in years ending
March 31 are:

Rental expense was $110.1 million, $108.7 million and $108.3 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000. Most real property leases contain renewal options and
provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and operating expenses in excess
of base period amounts.

14. Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

At March 31, 2002, we had a currency swap agreement to
convert CN$173 million to U.S.$125 million. This agreement matures in November 2002. We
also had several currency swap agreements to convert a total of 12.2 million
Pounds Sterling to $16.8 million. These agreements have various maturities
through December 2004.

On April 29, 2002, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements. The
first agreement exchanges a fixed interest rate of 8.91% per annum to LIBOR
plus 4.155%, on a notional amount of $100 million. The second agreement
exchanges a fixed interest rate of 6.30% per annum to LIBOR plus 1.575%, on a
notional amount of $150 million. These agreements expire in February and March
of 2005.

In February 2001, we paid $8.2 million to terminate two interest rate swap
agreements, each with a notional principal amount of $150 million. The swaps
were scheduled to mature in 2005 and 2008 and swap fixed interest payments of
6.30% and 6.40%, for floating interest payments based on a LIBOR index. These
swaps included an embedded interest rate cap of 7%. The termination fee is
being amortized on the straight-line method over the remaining life of the
underlying debt.

15. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

We maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit
retirement plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees. We
also provide postretirement benefits, consisting of health care and life
insurance benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Prior to 1997, substantially all U.S. full-time employees of McKesson were
covered under either the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan or
by bargaining unit sponsored multi-employer plans. In 1997, we amended the
Company-sponsored U.S. defined benefit plan to freeze all plan benefits based
on each employee’s plan compensation and creditable service accrued to that
date. Accordingly, U.S. employees joining the Company after 1997 are not
eligible for coverage under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement
plan. The benefits for such Company-sponsored plans are based primarily on age
of employees at date of retirement, years of service and employees’ pay during
the five years prior to retirement. We also have nonqualified supplemental
defined benefit plans for certain U.S executives, which are non-funded.



McKESSON CORPORATION

The change in benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status for our
U.S. defined benefit retirement plans are as follows:

These amounts are primarily associated with changes in executive

The assets of the plan consist primarily of listed common stocks (other
than that of the Company) and bonds. These assets are measured at fair value
(on a calendar year basis), which is determined based on quoted market prices.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The projected unit credit method is utilized for measuring net periodic
pension cost over the employees’ service life. Costs are funded based on the
recommendations of independent actuaries. The projected benefit obligations
for Company-sponsored plans were determined using discount rates of 7.25% at
December 31, 2001, 7.5% at December 31, 2000 and 7.75% at December 31, 1999 and
an assumed increase in future compensation levels of 4.0% for all periods
presented. The expected long-term rate of return on assets used to determine
pension expense was 9.75% for all periods.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have contributory
profit sharing investment plans (“PSIP”) for U.S.
employees not covered by collective bargaining arrangements. Eligible
employees may contribute up to 16% of their compensation to an individual
retirement savings account. The Company makes matching contributions equal to
or greater than 50% of employee contributions, not to exceed 3% of employee
compensation. The Company provides for the U.S. PSIP contributions with its
common shares through its leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Program (“ESOP”).

The ESOP has purchased an aggregate of 24.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock since inception. These purchases have been financed by
10 to 20-year loans from or guaranteed by us. The ESOP’s outstanding
borrowings are reported as a liability of the Company and the related
receivables from the ESOP are shown as a reduction of stockholders’ equity.
The loans are repaid by the ESOP from interest earnings on cash balances and
common dividends on shares not yet allocated to participants, common dividends
on certain allocated shares and Company cash contributions. The ESOP loan
maturities and rates are identical to the terms of related Company borrowings
(see Financial Note 11). Stock is made available from the ESOP based on debt
service payments on ESOP borrowings.

Contribution expense for the PSIP for the three years ended 2002 was all
ESOP related. After-tax ESOP expense, including interest expense on ESOP debt,
was $9.5 million, $9.6 million and $11.3 million, in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
Approximately 1.4 million, 1.5 million and 2.6 million shares of common stock
were allocated to plan participants in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Through March 31,
2002, 17.6 million common shares have been allocated to plan participants,
resulting in a balance of 6.7 million common shares in the ESOP which have not
yet been allocated to plan participants.

Healthcare and Life Insurance

In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide healthcare and life
insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Our policy is to fund these
benefits as claims are paid.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the postretirement
healthcare and life insurance benefits obligation:

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation were 11.0% in 2002 and 5% in 2001 and 2000.
The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported. Increasing the trend rate by one percentage point would
increase the accumulated postretirement healthcare and life insurance
obligation as of March 31, 2002 by $10.3 million and the related 2002 aggregate
service and interest costs by $0.7 million. Decreasing the trend rate by one
percentage point would reduce the accumulated postretirement healthcare and
life insurance obligation as of March 31, 2002 by $9.2 million and the related
2002 aggregate service and interest cost by $0.6 million. The discount rates
used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were
7.25%, 7.5% and 7.75% at March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

We have an employee discount stock purchase plan for eligible employees.
Under the plan, participants may authorize payroll deductions of up to 15% of
their total cash compensation to purchase our common stock at a 15% discount.
The plan has 24-month offering periods with purchases made every 6 months.
Purchases are made at the lower of the closing stock price on the first day of
the offering period or each purchase date.

16. Income Taxes

our foreign operations totaling $80.8 million were considered to be permanently
reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been recognized for the remittance
of such earnings to the U.S. since it is our intention to utilize those
earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and
development activities for an indefinite period of time, or to repatriate such
earnings when it is tax efficient to do so. The determination of the amount of
deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable since the computation would
depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a decision to
repatriate the earnings is made.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

17. Stockholders’ Equity

In October 1994, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right
(a “Right”) for each then outstanding share of common stock and authorized the
issuance of one Right for each share subsequently issued to purchase, upon the
occurrence of certain specified triggering events, a unit consisting of one
hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
Triggering events include, without limitation, the acquisition by another
entity of 15% or more of our common stock without the prior approval of our
Board. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and will cause
substantial dilution to the ownership interest of a person or group that
attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by the Board. The Rights expire
in 2004 unless redeemed earlier by the Board. As a result of the two-for-one
stock split in 1998, each share of common stock now has attached to it one-half
of a Right.

We have several
equity compensation plans (stock option, restricted stock and
stock purchase plans) under which employees and
non-employee directors receive grants and awards. As a result of
acquisitions, we also have 21 other option plans; however, no further awards
have been made under these plans since the date of acquisition. Under the
active stock option and restricted stock plans, we were authorized to
grant up to 76.1 million shares as of March
31, 2002.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by
the Company’s stockholders. The plans are administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, except for the Directors’ Plan (defined
below) which is administered by the Committee on Directors and Corporate
Governance.

1994 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan

The 1994 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “1994 Plan”) was
adopted by the Board of Directors in 1994 and provides for the grant of 41.2
million shares, which includes awards granted under predecessor plans, in the
form of nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options (“ISOs”), as
defined under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”), with or
without tandem stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), or restricted stock.

Options granted under the 1994 Plan are generally subject to the same
terms and conditions as those granted under the 1999 Plan, discussed below,
except that under the 1994 Plan (i) only executive officers of the Company are
eligible to receive option grants, (ii) ISOs may be granted to eligible
participants, and (iii) there is an annual per person limit on the number of
options for purposes of Section 162(m) of the
Code.

1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan

The 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan
(the “Directors’ Plan”) was adopted in 1997 and provides for the grant of 1.3
million shares in the form of nonqualified stock options or restricted stock
units to non-employee directors of the Company. Shares subject to option
grants which cease to be exercisable shall not be counted against the number of
shares available under the Directors’ Plan. Restricted stock units (described
below), whether or not distributed in the form of restricted stock,
will be
counted against the number of shares available. The Directors’ Plan will
terminate on December 31, 2006 or such earlier date as determined by the Board
of Directors.

The compensation for each non-employee director of the Company includes an
annual retainer. Under the Director’s Plan, each director is required to defer
50% of his or her annual retainer into either Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)
or nonqualified stock options (“Retainer Options”). Each director may also
defer the remaining 50% of the annual retainer into RSUs, Retainer Options or
into the Company’s deferred compensation plan (“DCAP II”), or may elect to
receive cash. Directors may also receive a fee for each Board or Committee meeting
attended, and Committee chairs receive an additional annual fee. These fees may
be deferred into RSUs or DCAP II or may be paid in cash.

Retainer Options are granted at not less than fair market value and have a term of ten years. The number of Retainer
Options granted is determined by applying a conversion factor to the closing
price of the common stock on the date of grant, and dividing that number into
the amount of annual retainer being deferred. Retainer Options granted prior to
May 29, 2002 vest after one year. Retainer Options granted after that date vest
immediately. Currently, each January directors are granted an option for
10,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.

The number of RSUs granted is determined by the amount of retainer and
fees deferred, divided by the fair market value of the Company’s common stock
on the last trading day of the calendar quarter in which those amounts would
otherwise be payable. RSUs entitle the holder, upon distribution, to receive a
cash payment equal to either the fair market value of one share of common
stock, or one share of common stock. RSUs terminate upon distribution.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, common stock to be issued in

The 1973 Stock Purchase Plan (the “SPP”) was adopted by the stockholders
of the Company’s predecessor in 1973. The Company’s stockholders approved an
additional 2.5 million shares to be issued under the SPP in 1999, which remain
available for issuance under the SPP. Rights to purchase shares are granted
under the SPP to key employees of the Company as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board. Members of the Committee are not eligible to receive
awards under the SPP.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The purchase price of the Company common stock subject to rights granted
under the SPP is the fair market value of such stock on the date the right is
exercised (which shall be the closing price of the Company’s common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)). Purchases are evidenced by written
stock purchase agreements which provide for the payment of the purchase price
by (i) payment in cash, or (ii) a promissory note payable on a repayment
schedule determined by the Committee, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).
Subject to the requirements of applicable law, stock purchased by an employee
may have to be pledged to the Company as collateral for the promissory note
under the terms and conditions within the stock purchase agreement.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) is intended to qualify as
an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. In March 2002, the Board amended the ESPP
to allow for participation in the plan by employees of certain of the Company’s
international and other subsidiaries. As to those employees, the ESPP does not
so qualify. The ESPP was initially adopted by the Board of Directors of HBOC
prior to the Company’s acquisition of HBOC. Currently, 6.1 million shares have
been authorized for issuance under the ESPP; however, the Company is asking its
stockholders to approve an increase of 5.0 million shares for the ESPP at its
2002 annual meeting.

Each employee of the Company (and subsidiaries and related entities
designated by the Committee) who has been employed for 60 days or more prior to
the beginning of an offering period and who customarily works at least 20 hours
per week and more than five months in any calendar year is eligible to
participate in the ESPP.

The ESPP is implemented through a continuous series of 24-month offerings
beginning on the first trading day on or after each May 1 and November 1 (the
“Offering Dates”) and ending on the last trading day of the month which is 24
months later (the “Offering Periods”) and six-month periods beginning on each
May 1 and November 1 and ending on the following October 31 and April 30,
during which contributions may be made toward the purchase of common stock
under the plan (“Purchase Periods”). If the fair market value of a share of
the Company’s common stock on the first day of the Offering Period in which a participant is
enrolled is higher than on the first day of any subsequent Offering Period, the
participant will automatically be re-enrolled for the subsequent Offering
Period.

Each eligible employee may become a participant in the ESPP by making an
election, at least ten days prior to any Offering Date, authorizing regular
payroll deductions during the next succeeding Purchase Period, the amount of
which may not exceed 15% of a participant’s compensation for any payroll
period. Payroll deductions are credited to a cash account for each
participant. At the end of each Purchase Period, the funds in each cash
account will be used to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, which
are then held in a stock account. A participant has the right to vote the
shares credited to his or her stock account, and may withdraw these shares at
any time.

The purchase price of each share of the Company’s common stock will be the
lesser of (i) 85% of the fair market value of such share on the first day of
the Offering Period; or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of such share on the
last day of the applicable Purchase Period. The purchase price is subject to
adjustment to reflect certain changes in the Company’s capitalization. In
general, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by
a participant for each Purchase Period is determined by dividing $12,500 by the
fair market value of one share of common stock on the Offering Date. In no
event may a participant purchase shares with a fair market value in excess of
$25,000 in each calendar year.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have not been
submitted for approval by the Company’s stockholders:

1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan

The 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “Plan”) was adopted
by the Board of Directors in 1999. The Plan provides for the grant of 32.7
million shares in the form of nonqualified stock options, with or without SARs
or restricted stock. Shares subject to option grants which cease to be
exercisable continue to be available for subsequent option grants. Options may
be granted under the Plan to eligible employees of the Company. No officers or
directors (as defined under the NYSE rules (the “NYSE Rules”)) participate in
this Plan, as the Plan is intended to be broadly-based under Section 312 of the
NYSE Rules.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Options are granted at not less than fair market value and have a term of
ten years. Options granted as installment options generally become exercisable
in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date, and
options granted as non-installment options become fully exercisable at any time
after four years from the date of grant. Options are exercisable for up to
three months following termination of employment. The post-termination
exercise period may generally be extended for a period of time up to three
years, but in no event beyond the original option term, if the termination is
due to retirement, death or long-term disability. In addition, options are
subject to special rules regarding forfeiture in situations when a participant
engages in actions specified in the Statement of Terms and Conditions
(“ST & C”) as being detrimental to
the Company.

Restricted stock
granted under the Plan contains certain restrictions
on transferability and may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of until such restrictions lapse. Such shares will be
forfeited if the grantee’s continuous employment with the Company is terminated
(except as provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the restricted
stock award) prior to the lapsing of the restrictions or if achievement of
performance goals set forth as a condition to the lapsing of restrictions has
not been attained. Grantees may elect to use stock to satisfy any withholding
tax obligation upon the lapsing of restrictions on restricted stock awards. In
addition, restricted stock awards are subject to special rules regarding
forfeiture in situations when a participant engages in actions specified in the
ST&C as being detrimental to the Company. The Plan also provides
that outstanding options become immediately exercisable and the restrictions on
restricted stock awards immediately lapse upon the occurrence of a change of
control of the Company.

1998 Canadian Stock Incentive Plan

The 1998 Canadian Stock Incentive Plan (the “Canadian Plan”) was adopted
by the Board of Directors in January 1998, following the Company’s acquisition
of a Canadian company, to provide nonqualified stock options, with or without
tandem SARs, to eligible employees of the Canadian company. The Canadian Plan
has subsequently been amended to allow for the grant of stock options to
employees of any of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries. A total of 0.9
million shares have been authorized for issuance under the Canadian Plan.

Options granted under the Canadian Plan are generally subject to the same
terms and conditions as those granted under the 1999 Plan, discussed above,
except that (i) options may be granted for less than the fair market value of
the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and
(ii) all options will
become immediately exercisable upon an employee’s disability or death and must
be exercised within three years of such date.

Stock Option Plans Adopted in January 1999 and August 1999

On January 27, 1999 and August 25, 1999 the Board of Directors adopted
certain stock option plans (the “January 1999 Plan” and the “August 1999 Plan”,
or together the “Plans”) to provide stock options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock to eligible employees of the Company. A maximum of 5.2
million and 5.8 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance
under the January 1999 and August 1999 Plans. In each case the Plans state
that: (i) under each of the Plans no single officer or director of the Company or any
subsidiary could acquire more than 1% of the Company’s common stock outstanding
at the time the Plans were adopted and (ii) each of the Plans, together with all stock
option or purchase plans, or any other arrangements pursuant to which officers
or directors of the Company may acquire common stock (other than stock plans
for which stockholder approval is not required under Section 312.03 of the NYSE
Rules), does not authorize the issuance of more than 5% of the Company’s common
stock outstanding at the time the Plans were adopted (collectively the “NYSE
Limits”). Options were granted under each of the Plans to eligible employees of the
Company. No further grants will be made from either of the Plans.

The options were granted at not less than fair market value and have a
term of ten years. For options granted under the January 1999 Plan, an
optionee must generally remain in the continuous employment of the Company and/or one of
its affiliates for a period of at least twenty-four months from the date on
which the option was granted in order to become eligible to exercise such
option, at which time the option shall be exercisable as to 50% of the shares
subject to the option. Thereafter, the option will be exercisable as to 25%
of the shares subject to the option after 36 months of continuous employment
and shall become exercisable as to the remaining 25% of the shares subject to
the option after 48 months of continuous employment. Options granted under the
August 1999 Plan as installment options generally become exercisable in four
equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date and options
granted as non-installment options become fully exercisable at any time after
four years from the date of



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

grant. Any portion of an option not exercised as it becomes exercisable
shall accumulate and may thereafter be exercised by the optionee at any time
during the option term. Options are generally exercisable for up to three
months following termination of employment. The post-termination exercise
period may generally be extended for a period of time up to three years, but in
no event beyond the original option term, if the termination is due to
retirement, death or long-term disability.

The Plans provide that outstanding options become fully vested and
immediately exercisable upon the occurrence of the optionee’s death, long-term
disability, retirement (subject to certain conditions) or a change of control
of the Company. In addition, awards under the Plans are subject to special
rules regarding forfeiture in situations when a participant engages
in actions specified in the ST&C’s as being
detrimental to the Company.

Restricted Stock Plan Adopted in January 2000

On January 31, 2000 the Board adopted a certain restricted stock plan (the
“January 2000 Plan”) to make grants of restricted stock to eligible employees
of the Company. A maximum of 0.5 million shares of common stock was authorized
for issuance under the January 2000 Plan, subject to the NYSE Limits. No
further grants will be made from the January 2000 Plan.

Restricted stock granted under the January 2000 Plan shall contain certain
restrictions on transferability and may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged or otherwise disposed of until such restrictions lapse. Such shares
will be forfeited if the grantee’s continuous employment with the Company is
terminated (except as provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the
restricted stock award) prior to the lapsing of the restrictions. Grantees may
elect to use stock to satisfy any withholding tax obligation upon the lapsing
of restrictions on restricted stock awards.

If a grantee’s
employment with the Company terminates as a result of his or
her death, disability or retirement (subject to certain conditions), the
restrictions on restricted stock awards shall lapse upon the date of such
termination. In addition, awards under the January 2000 Plan are subject to
special rules regarding forfeiture in situations when a participant engages in
actions specified in the ST&Cs as being detrimental to the Company.

1999 Executive Stock Purchase Plan

The 1999 Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999 SPP”) was adopted by the
Board of Directors in February 1999. The 1999 SPP provided for the grant of
rights to purchase a maximum of 0.7 million shares of common stock subject to the
NYSE Limits. No further grants will be made from the 1999 SPP. Rights to
purchase shares were granted under the 1999 SPP to eligible employees of the
Company. Members of the Board of Directors who were not employed as regular
salaried officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
were not permitted to participate in the Plan. Members of the Committee were
not eligible to receive awards under the Plan.

The purchase price of the Company common stock subject to rights granted
under the 1999 SPP was equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common
stock on the date the right was exercised (which was the closing
price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE). Purchases were evidenced by written stock purchase agreements which
provide for the payment of the purchase price by (i) payment in cash, or (ii) a
promissory note payable on a repayment schedule determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).

HBOC 1994 UK Sharesave Scheme

In connection with the acquisition by the Company of HBOC, we assumed the
HBOC 1994 UK Sharesave Scheme (“1994 Scheme”) which is similar to the ESPP,
under which 24,000 shares remain available for issuance.

Employees and
previous directors of HBOC and its subsidiaries, who are residents of
the United Kingdom were eligible to receive options under the 1994 Scheme. The
exercise price of the stock covered by each option shall not be less than 85%
of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date the option is
granted. Participants under



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

the 1994 Scheme pay for options through monthly contributions, subject to
both minimum and maximum monthly amount limitations. If, after three years
from the date an option was granted to a participant, the participant is
terminated by reason of his or her death, disability, retirement, change of
control or any other reason other than for cause, the participant may exercise
the option for a period of three years. In the event the participant is
terminated, other than as described in the immediately preceding sentence, or
in the event a participant gives notice of his or her intent to discontinue
monthly contributions or requests repayment of such monthly contributions, the
option shall not be exercisable at all. In the event a participant withdraws
from the 1994 Scheme, his or her contributions shall be refunded, provided that
such refunded amount shall include interest in the event a participant had made
monthly contributions for more than twelve months.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, we have elected to account for our stock-based
compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Had compensation cost for the
stock option plan been recognized based on the fair value at the grant dates
for awards under those plans, consistent with the provision of SFAS No. 123,
net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share would have been as indicated in
the table below. Since pro forma compensation cost relates to all periods over
which the awards vest, the initial impact on pro forma income (loss) from
continuing operations may not be representative of compensation cost in
subsequent years, when the effect of amortization of multiple awards would be
reflected.

18. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to
basic earnings (loss) per share except that it reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

The computations for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share from
continuing operations are as follows

Approximately 27.4 million and 36.5 million stock options were excluded
from the computations of diluted net earnings per share in 2002 and 2000 as
their exercise price was higher than the Company’s average stock price. For
2001 and 2000, the convertible preferred securities were excluded from the
calculations of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as they
were antidilutive as were the stock options for 2001.

Diluted earnings per share for 2000 was revised to include the dilutive
effect of 2.9 million stock options. Diluted earnings per share from
continuing and discontinued operations were reduced by $0.01 each from
previously reported amounts of $0.66 and $1.91, for a total of $2.57, based on
revised weighted average shares outstanding of 284.2 million.

19. Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

I. Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by McKesson, formerly known as McKesson HBOC,
Inc., in April, May and July of 1999 that McKesson had determined that certain
software sales transactions in its Information Technology Business unit (now
referred to as the Information Solutions segment) were improperly recorded as
revenue and reversed, as of May 10, 2002, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed
against McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, and other defendants, including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.
(“Bear Stearns”) and Arthur Andersen LLP (“Andersen”).

Federal Actions

Sixty-seven of the above mentioned actions have been filed in Federal
Court (the “Federal Actions”). Of these, sixty-one were filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California, one in the Northern
District of Illinois, which has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice,
one in the Northern District of Georgia, which has been transferred to the
Northern District of California, one in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
which has been transferred to the Northern District of California, two in the
Western District of Louisiana, which have been transferred to the Northern
District of California, and one in the District of Arizona, which has been
transferred to the Northern District of California.

On November 2, 1999, the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the Northern
District of California issued an order consolidating fifty-three of these
actions into one consolidated action entitled

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc.
Securities Litigation

, (Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”).
By order dated December 22, 1999, Judge



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Whyte appointed the New York State Common Retirement Fund as lead
plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff”) and approved Lead Plaintiff’s choice of counsel.

By order dated February 7, 2000, Judge Whyte coordinated a class action
alleging claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (commonly
known as “ERISA”),

Chang v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., (Case No. C-00-20030
RMW), and a shareholder derivative action that had been filed in the Northern
District under the caption

Cohen v. McCall et al.

, (Case No. C-99-20916 RMW)
with the Consolidated Action. There has been no further significant activity
in the

Cohen

action. Recent developments in the

Chang

action are discussed
below.

Lead Plaintiff filed an Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint
(the “ACCAC”) on February 25, 2000. The ACCAC generally alleged that
defendants violated the federal securities laws in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May and July 1999. On September
28, 2000, Judge Whyte dismissed all of the ACCAC claims against McKesson under
Section 11 of the Securities Act with prejudice, dismissed a claim under
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act with leave to amend, and declined to dismiss
a claim against McKesson under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.

On November 14, 2000, Lead Plaintiff filed its Second Amended and
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“SAC”). As with its ACCAC, Lead
Plaintiff’s SAC generally alleged that McKesson violated the federal securities
laws in connection with the events leading to McKesson’s announcements in
April, May and July 1999. The SAC names McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s
or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, Bear Stearns
and Andersen as defendants. The SAC purported to state claims against McKesson and HBOC
under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act.

On January 11, 2001, McKesson filed an action in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California against the Lead Plaintiff in the
Consolidated Action individually, and as a representative of a defendant class
of former HBOC shareholders who exchanged HBOC shares for Company shares in the
January 12, 1999 merger of a McKesson subsidiary into HBOC (the “Merger”),

McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State Common Retirement Fund, Inc. et al.,

(Case No. C01-20021 RMW) (the “Complaint and Counterclaim”). In the Complaint
and Counterclaim, the Company alleges that the exchanged HBOC shares were
artificially inflated due to undisclosed accounting improprieties, and that the
exchange ratio therefore provided more shares to former HBOC shareholders than
would have otherwise been the case. In this action, the Company seeks to
recover the “unjust enrichment” received by those HBOC shareholders who
exchanged more than 20,000 HBOC shares in the Merger. The Company does not
allege any wrongdoing by these shareholders. On January 9, 2002, Judge Whyte
dismissed the Complaint and Counterclaim with prejudice. On February 8, 2002,
the Company filed a Notice of Appeal from this ruling to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”). The Company’s
opening brief to the Ninth Circuit is currently due to be filed on or before
July 5, 2002. Because certain decisions of the Ninth Circuit raise a question
as to whether the Ninth Circuit has appellate jurisdiction over the Company’s
appeal, the Company has also filed a motion before Judge Whyte for an order
certifying his January 9 dismissal order for immediate appeal.

On January 7, 2002, Judge Whyte dismissed the claim in the SAC against
McKesson under Section 10(b), to the extent that the claim was based on any
pre-Merger conduct or statements by McKesson, and also dismissed the claim
against McKesson under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, granting Lead
Plaintiff thirty (30) days leave “for one last opportunity” to amend those
claims. Judge Whyte dismissed the claim against HBOC under Section 14(a) of
the Exchange Act without leave to amend. The Section 10(b) claim based on
post-Merger statements remains pending against McKesson, and a Section 10(b)
claim based on pre-Merger statements remains pending against HBOC.

On February 15, 2002, Lead Plaintiff filed a Third Amended and
Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the “TAC”) in the Consolidated Action.
The TAC, like the SAC, purports to state claims against McKesson and HBOC under
Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May and July 1999, and names
McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or
directors, Andersen and Bear Stearns as defendants. On April 5, 2002,
McKesson filed a motion to dismiss Lead Plaintiff’s claim under Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act to the extent that it is based on McKesson’s pre-Merger
conduct, and the claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act in its entirety.
McKesson’s motion to dismiss was heard on June 7, 2002, and the court has not
yet issued an opinion.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Several individual actions have also been filed in or transferred to the
Northern District of California. On November 12, 1999, an individual
shareholder action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California under the caption

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

,
(C-99-21192 RMW). The Plaintiffs in

Jacobs

are former HBOC shareholders who
acquired their HBOC shares pursuant to a registration statement issued by HBOC
prior to the Merger, and then exchanged their HBOC shares for McKesson shares
in the Merger. Plaintiffs in

Jacobs

assert claims under federal and state
securities laws and a claim for common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including attorneys’
fees. Judge Whyte’s December 22, 1999, order consolidated the

Jacobs

action
with the Consolidated Action. With leave of court, the

Jacobs

plaintiffs
amended their complaint, but the action remains stayed and there has been no
discovery, motion practice or other activity in the case.

On September 21, 2000, the plaintiffs in

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

,
filed a new individual action entitled

Jacobs v. HBO & Company

(Case No.
C-00-20974 RMW). The

Jacobs

complaint names only HBOC as a defendant and
asserts claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act and various state law causes of action. The complaint
seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and costs of suit,
including attorneys’ fees. This action has been assigned to Judge Whyte and
consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On December 16, 1999, an individual action was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California under the caption

Bea v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al

., (Case No. C-00-20072 RMW). Plaintiffs in

Bea

filed an
Amended Complaint on March 9, 2000. Plaintiffs in

Bea

allege that they
acquired the Company’s common stock prior to the Merger and sold that stock
after the April 1999 announcement at a loss. The

Bea

complaint asserts claims
under the federal and state securities laws, and a claim for fraud. Plaintiffs
seek (i) unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and (ii) reasonable
costs and expenses of suit, including attorneys’ fees.

Bea

is currently stayed
and has been consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On January 7, 2000, an individual action was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California under the caption

Cater v.
McKesson Corporation et al

., (Case No. C-00-20327 RMW). The plaintiff is Terry
Cater, a former employee of the Company who, at the time he ceased active
employment with the Company, held options to purchase shares of Company stock,
and also held shares of the Company’s restricted stock. Plaintiff alleges that
these options and restricted stock were substantially devalued as a result of
the Merger and the subsequent drop in the Company’s stock price. Plaintiff in

Cater

asserts claims under the federal securities laws as well as claims for
breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
Plaintiff seeks (i) unspecified special damages in excess of $50,000, (ii)
unspecified general damages, (iii) prejudgment interest and (iv) reasonable
attorneys’ fees. The case has been assigned to Judge Whyte and the parties
have stipulated to a stay pending the outcome of the motions to dismiss in the
Consolidated Action.

On February 7, 2000, an action entitled

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al

., (Case No. CV 00-0188) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Louisiana. The same plaintiffs then filed a virtually identical
parallel action in Louisiana State Court, Rapides Parish, under the caption

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al

. (filed as Case No. 199018; Case No.
CV-00-0522 after removal to federal court). Plaintiffs, former shareholders of
Automatic Prescription Services, allege claims under the federal securities
laws, and claims for breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and
detrimental reliance. The state court action was removed to federal court and
the two

Baker

cases have been transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On July 27, 2001, an action was filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California captioned

Pacha, et al., v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc., et al

., (No. C01-20713 PVT) (“

Pacha

”). The

Pacha

plaintiffs allege
that they were individual shareholders of McKesson stock on November 27, 1998,
and assert that McKesson and HBOC violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act
and SEC Rule 14a-9, and that McKesson, aided by HBOC, breached its fiduciary
duties to plaintiffs by issuing a joint proxy statement in connection with the
Merger which allegedly contained false and misleading statements or omissions.
Plaintiffs name as defendants McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former
officers or directors of McKesson or HBOC, Andersen and Bear Stearns. On
November 13, 2001, Judge Whyte ordered

Pacha

consolidated with the Consolidated
Action and stayed all further proceedings.

Hess v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., an action filed in state court in
Arizona (Case No. C-20003862) on behalf of former shareholders of Ephrata
Diamond Spring Water Company (“Ephrata”) who acquired McKesson shares in
exchange for their Ephrata stock when McKesson acquired Ephrata in January
1999, was removed to federal court, transferred to the Northern District and
consolidated with the Consolidated Action. Judge Whyte also stayed all further
proceedings in

Hess

except for the filing of an amended complaint, which was
filed on or about December 15, 2001 (the “

Hess

Amended Complaint”). The

Hess

Amended Complaint generally incorporates the allegations and claims asserted in
Lead Plaintiff’s SAC in the Consolidated Action and also includes various
common law causes of action relating to McKesson’s acquisition of Ephrata. The
Company is not currently required to respond to the

Hess

Amended Complaint.

On June 28, 2001, the

Chang

plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against
McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of McKesson or
HBOC, and The Chase Manhattan Bank. The amended complaint in

Chang

generally
alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with
administering the McKesson HBOC Profit Sharing Investment Plan (the “PSI Plan”)
and the HBOC Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”). Plaintiffs in

Chang

are alleged former employees of McKesson and participants in the PSI
Plan, and purportedly seek relief under sections 404-405, 409 and 502 of ERISA
on behalf of a class defined to include participants in the PSI Plan, including
participants under the HBOC Plan, who maintained an account balance under the
PSI Plan as of April 27, 1999, who had not received a distribution from the PSI
Plan as of April 27, 1999, and who suffered losses as a result of the alleged
breaches of duty. Plaintiff seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and HBOC
breached their fiduciary duties, (ii) an order requiring defendants to restore
to the PSI Plan all losses caused by these purported breaches of fiduciary
duty, and (iii) attorneys’ fees. In October 2001, McKesson, HBOC, Chase and
other defendants moved to dismiss the

Chang

action. These motions are
currently set for hearing on May 17, 2002.

On February 7, 2002, an action was filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California captioned

Adams v. McKesson
Information Solutions, Inc. et al

., No. C-02-06 85 JCS (“

Adams

”). Plaintiff in

Adams

filed a first amended complaint on March 15, 2002, against McKesson
Information Solutions, Inc. (formerly HBOC), McKesson, certain current or
former officers, directors or employees of McKesson or HBOC, and other
defendants. Plaintiff alleges that he was a participant in the HBOC Plan and
generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC breached their fiduciary duties to the
HBOC Plan and its participants or engaged in transactions prohibited by ERISA.
Plaintiff asserts his claims on behalf of a putative class defined to include
all participants in the HBOC Plan and their beneficiaries for whose benefit the
HBOC Plan acquired HBOC stock from March 31, 1996 to April 1, 1999. Plaintiff
seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and HBOC breached their fiduciary duties,
(ii) an order requiring defendants to restore to the plan all losses caused by
these purported breaches of fiduciary duty, and (iii) reasonable attorneys’
fees, costs and expenses. On April 3, 2002, Judge Whyte issued a Related Case
Order in which he found that

Adams

is related to the Consolidated Action. By
operation of a pretrial order entered in the Consolidated Action, Judge Whyte’s
Related Case Order automatically consolidated

Adams

into the Consolidated
Action. On April 25, 2002, Plaintiff filed an application with the Court
requesting that the

Adams

action be relieved from automatic consolidation with
the Consolidated Action, which HBOC intends to oppose. Defendants are
presently not obligated to respond to the first amended complaint.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have also been filed in various state courts in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State
Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State Actions generally allege
misconduct by McKesson or HBOC in connection with the events leading to
McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements.

Two of the State Actions are derivative actions:

Ash, et al., v. McCall,
et al

., (Case No. 17132), filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and

Mitchell
v. McCall et al.

, (Case. No. 304415), filed in California Superior Court, City
and County of San Francisco. McKesson moved to dismiss both of these actions
and to stay the

Mitchell

action in favor of the earlier filed

Ash

and

Cohen

derivative actions. Plaintiffs in

Mitchell

agreed to defer any action by the
court on McKesson’s motions pending resolution of McKesson’s dismissal motion
in

Ash

. On September 15, 2000, in the

Ash

case, the Court of Chancery
dismissed all causes of action with leave to re-plead certain of the dismissed
claims, and on January 22, 2001, the

Ash

plaintiffs filed a Third Amended
Complaint which is presently the subject of McKesson’s motion to dismiss.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Five of the State Actions are class actions. Three of these were filed in
Delaware Chancery Court:

Derdiger v. Tallman et al.

, (Case No. 17276),

Carroll
v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

, (Case No. 17454),

and Kelly v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al

., (Case No. 17282 NC). Two additional actions were filed in Delaware
Superior Court:

Edmondson v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

, (Case No. 99-951) and

Caravetta v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

, (Case No. 00C-04-214 WTQ). The

Carroll

and

Kelly

actions have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. McKesson
removed

Edmondson

to federal court in Delaware and filed a motion to dismiss,
which was granted by the federal court on March 5, 2002. McKesson filed
motions to stay the

Derdiger

and

Caravetta

actions in favor of proceedings in
the federal Consolidated Action, which were granted. On December 20, 2001, the
plaintiff in the

Derdiger

action filed a motion to vacate the stay, but that
motion has not yet been briefed or heard by the Court.

Several of the State Actions are individual actions which have been filed
in various state courts. Five of these were filed in the California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco:

Yurick v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

,
(Case No. 303857),

The State of Oregon by and through the Oregon Public
Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No. 307619),

Utah State Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., (Case No. 311269),

Minnesota State Board of Investment v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No.
311747), and

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al

., CGC-02-405792. In

Yurick

, the trial court has sustained
McKesson’s demurrer to the original complaint without leave to amend with
respect to all causes of action except plaintiffs’ claims for common law fraud
and negligent misrepresentation, which the trial court has allowed to remain in
the case. The Court also stayed

Yurick

pending the commencement of discovery
in the Consolidated Action, but allowed the filing of an amended complaint. On
May 23, 2001, the California Court of Appeals affirmed the

Yurick

trial court’s
order dismissing claims against certain of the individual defendants without
leave to amend. On July 31, 2001, McKesson’s demurrer to the Second Amended
Complaint was overruled and McKesson’s alternative motion to strike was denied.

The

Oregon

,

Utah

and

Minnesota

actions referenced above are individual
securities actions filed in the California Superior Court for the City and
County of San Francisco by out-of-state pension funds. On April 20, 2001,
plaintiffs in

Utah

and

Minnesota

filed amended complaints against McKesson,
HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of McKesson or HBOC,
Andersen and Bear Stearns. The amended complaints in

Utah

and

Minnesota

assert
claims under California and Georgia’s securities laws, claims under Georgia’s
RICO statute, and various common law claims under California and Georgia law.
On June 22, 2001, McKesson and HBOC demurred to and moved to strike portions of
the amended complaints and also moved to stay these actions pending the final
resolution of the Consolidated Action. The court held hearings on McKesson’s
demurrers and motions to strike on November 15, 2001, January 29, 2002, and
April 23, 2002, but has not issued a final ruling on the motions. By order
dated December 3, 2001, the court denied McKesson’s motion to stay the entire
action pending the final resolution of the Consolidated Action but ordered that
all discoveries in the

Utah

and

Minnesota

actions would be stayed pending the
commencement of discovery in the Consolidated Action.

On May 30, 2001, plaintiffs in

Oregon

filed a second amended complaint
against McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of
McKesson or HBOC, and Andersen. The second amended complaint in

Oregon

asserts claims under California and Georgia’s securities laws, claims under
Georgia’s RICO statute, and various common law claims under California and
Georgia law. The parties to the

Oregon

action previously agreed to a stay of
all proceedings in that action, other than motions to test the sufficiency of
the pleadings, pending the commencement of discovery in the Consolidated
Action. On April 4, 2001, the plaintiff in

Oregon

filed a motion to lift the
stipulated stay of discovery, which McKesson and HBOC opposed. McKesson also
moved the court for an order modifying the stipulated stay to stay all
proceedings in the action pending the final resolution of the Consolidated
Action. Also on June 22, 2001, McKesson and HBOC demurred to and moved to
strike portions of

Oregon’s

second amended complaint. The court held hearings
on McKesson’s demurrers and motions to strike on November 15, 2001, January 29,
2002, and April 23, 2002, but has not issued a final ruling on the motions. By
order dated December 7, 2001, the court denied McKesson’s motion to stay all
proceedings in

Oregon

but ordered that all discoveries would be stayed pending
the commencement of discovery in the Consolidated Action.

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al.

, CGC-02-405792 (“

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund

”) was filed on March
19, 2002, in Superior Court in San Francisco. Plaintiffs in

Merrill Lynch
Fundamental Growth Fund

allege that they purchased Company stock after the
Merger and sold that stock at a loss after April 28, 1999. Plaintiffs name as
defendants the Company, HBOC, Andersen, Bear Stearns and certain current or
former officers or directors of the Company or HBOC, and assert causes of
action under California’s securities statutes, Business and Professions Code §
17200, and common law claims for fraud, negligent



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

misrepresentation, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting in connection with
the events leading to McKesson’s need to restate HBOC’s financial statements.
Plaintiffs also assert claims under New Jersey’s RICO statute, Georgia’s
securities statutes, and Georgia RICO. Plaintiffs seek restitution in an
unspecified amount, unspecified compensatory and treble damages, reasonable
attorneys’ and experts’ fees, and costs and expenses. The Company’s counsel
and counsel for the plaintiffs are currently discussing an appropriate response
date to the complaint.

Several individual actions have been filed in various state courts outside
of California. Several of these cases have been filed in Georgia state courts.
On October 29, 1999, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court under the
caption

Powell v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, and (Case No. 1999-CV- 15443).
Plaintiff in

Powell

is a former HBOC employee seeking lost commissions as well
as asserting claims under Georgia’s securities and racketeering laws, and
various common law causes of action. The

Powell

action names as defendants the
Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. The Company filed a motion
to stay, which was granted as to the Georgia securities law claims but not the
Georgia RICO claims. Plaintiff thereafter voluntarily dismissed the action.
On September 11, 2000, Plaintiff re-filed his action under the caption

Powell
v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al

., Case No. 2000-CV-27864, reasserting the same
claims against the same defendants. On October 11, 2000, McKesson and HBOC
filed answers, motions to dismiss, and motions for a partial stay. The motions
for partial stay were granted. This case has been settled and the action was
dismissed on February 22, 2002.

On December 9, 1999, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Gwinnett
County, under the caption

Adler v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No.
99-C-7980-3). Plaintiff in

Adler

is a former HBOC shareholder and asserts a
claim for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance. The

Adler

action names
as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. Plaintiff
seeks damages in excess of $43 million, as well as punitive damages, and costs
of suit, including attorneys’ fees. The Company has answered the complaint in

Adler

. On May 26, 2000, the court denied McKesson’s motion to stay. On July
14, 2000, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, which McKesson and HBOC
answered on August 21, 2000. Discovery has commenced in the

Adler

action and
is ongoing.

On October 24, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned:

Suffolk Partners Limited Partnership et al., v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al

., (No. 00VS010469A). Plaintiffs in the

Suffolk

action
allegedly purchased the Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the
April 1999 announcement. Plaintiffs assert claims under Georgia’s securities
and racketeering laws, and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The

Suffolk

action names as defendants
the Company, HBOC, and certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, and Andersen. Like the Consolidated Action, the claims
in the

Suffolk

action generally arise out of the January 12, 1999, Merger, and
the Company’s announcement of the need to restate its financial statements.
Plaintiffs seek (i) compensatory damages of approximately $21.8 million, as
well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with respect to
certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Company and HBOC separately answered the complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the

Suffolk

action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. On August 2,
2001, the Court granted the motions to stay, and this case is stayed until all
discoveries are completed in the Consolidated Class Action pending in
California.

On November 1, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned:

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. ET al.

, and
(No. 00 VS 010801). Plaintiff in the

Curran

action allegedly purchased the
Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999 announcement.
The claims in the

Curran

action are identical to the claims in the

Suffolk

action. Plaintiff seeks (i) compensatory damages of approximately $2.6
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The

Curran

action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, and
certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and
Andersen. The Company and HBOC separately answered the complaint on January
9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the

Curran

action in
favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. The Court granted the
motions to stay on August 22, 2001.

On December 12, 2001, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned:

Drake v. McKesson Corp., et al.

causes of action. Plaintiff seeks (i) approximately $0.3 million in
unpaid commissions, (ii) unspecified compensatory, consequential, actual,
exemplary, and punitive damages, and (iii) prejudgment and post-judgment
interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. The

Drake

action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay
Gilbertson. The parties entered into a Consent Order for Partial Stay on
February 27, 2002, which stayed Plaintiff’s Georgia securities law, fraud and
RICO claims. On March 4, 2002, McKesson and McKesson Information Solutions
Inc. separately filed their answers.

On January 31, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton
County, under the caption

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v McKesson, Inc. et.
al.

, (Case No. 2002-CV-48407). Plaintiffs in the

Green

action are former HBOC
shareholders and assert claims for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance.
Plaintiff Holcombe Green was also a former officer, chairman and director of
HBOC. The

Green

action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi
and Jay Gilbertson. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $100
million, as well as unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and
costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. The Company and HBOC filed their
respective answers and counterclaims on April 22, 2002. The Company and HBOC
also filed their motions to stay and dismiss. Discovery is under way and will
proceed for some time, unless the court grants the Company’s and HBOC’s motions
to stay and/or dismiss.

On February 6, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton
County, under the caption

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson, Inc. et
al.

, (Case No. 2002-CV-48612). Plaintiff in the

Hall

action is a former HBOC
shareholder and asserts a claim for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance.
The

Hall

action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay
Gilbertson. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in excess of $100 million, as
well as unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit,
including attorneys’ fees. The Company and HBOC filed their respective answers
on April 22, 2002. The Company also filed its counterclaim for unjust
enrichment. On April 26, 2002, the Company and HBOC filed motions to stay and
dismiss. HBOC also filed a third party complaint against Holcombe Green for
indemnification. Discovery is under way and will proceed for some time, unless
the court grants the Company’s and HBOC’s motions to stay and/or dismiss.
Additionally, the defendants in

Hall

have moved to have the case consolidated
with the

Green

action.

On September 28, 1999, an action was filed in Delaware Superior Court
under the caption

Kelly v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, and (C.A. No. 99C-09-265
WCC). Plaintiffs in

Kelly

are former shareholders of KWS&P/SFA, which merged
into McKesson after the HBOC transaction. Plaintiffs assert claims under the
federal securities laws, as well as claims for breach of contract and breach of
the duty of good faith and fair dealing. On January 17, 2002, the Delaware
Superior Court denied the

Kelly

plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment
and denied McKesson’s motion to dismiss, while granting the motions to dismiss
for lack of personal jurisdiction that were filed by certain former officers
and directors of McKesson and HBOC. The parties thereafter commenced discovery
by exchanging document requests and interrogatories. The court in

Kelly

has
scheduled a trial to begin on May 5, 2003.

The United States Attorneys’ Office and the Securities and Exchange
Commission are conducting investigations into the matters leading to the
restatement. On May 15, 2000, the United States Attorney’s Office filed a
one-count information against former HBOC officer, Dominick DeRosa, charging
Mr. DeRosa with aiding and abetting securities fraud, and on May 15, 2000, Mr.
DeRosa entered a guilty plea to that charge. On September 28, 2000, an
indictment was unsealed in the Northern District of California against former
HBOC officer, Jay P. Gilbertson, and former Company and HBOC officer, Albert J.
Bergonzi (United States v. Bergonzi, et al., Case No. CR-00-0505). On that
same date, a civil complaint was filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission against Mr. Gilbertson, Mr. Bergonzi and Mr. DeRosa (Securities and
Exchange Commission v. Gilbertson, et al., Case No. C-00-3570). Mr. DeRosa has
settled with the Securities Exchange Commission without admitting or denying
the substantive allegations of the complaint. On January 10, 2001, the grand
jury returned a superseding indictment in the Northern District of California
against Messrs. Gilbertson and Bergonzi (United States v. Bergonzi, et al.,
Case No. CR-00-0505). On September 27, 2001, the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed securities fraud charges against six former HBOC officers and
employees. Simultaneous with the filing of the Commission’s civil complaints,
four of the six defendants settled the claims brought against them by, among
other things, consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations of the
complaints, to entry of permanent injunctions against all of the alleged
violations, and agreed to pay civil penalties in various amounts. On January
3, 2002, the Company was



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

notified in writing by the Securities and Exchange Commission that its
investigation has been terminated as to the Company, and that no enforcement
action has been recommended to the Commission.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings, or to estimate the amounts
of, or potential range of, loss with respect to those proceedings. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain.
The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments
against the Company or settlements that could require substantial payments by
the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigation and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for product liability and other damages, investigations relating to
governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal
conduct of our business. These include:

Antitrust Matters

We are currently a defendant in numerous civil antitrust actions filed
since 1993 in federal and state courts by retail pharmacies. The federal cases
were coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court in
the Northern District of Illinois and are known as MDL 997. MDL 997 consists
of approximately 109 actions brought by approximately 3,500 individual retail,
chain and supermarket pharmacies (the “Individual Actions”). In 1999, the
court dismissed a related class action following a judgment as a matter of law
entered in favor of defendants, which was unsuccessfully appealed. There are
numerous other defendants in these actions, including several pharmaceutical
manufacturers and several other wholesale distributors. These cases allege, in
essence, that the defendants have violated the Sherman Act by conspiring to fix
the prices of brand-name pharmaceuticals sold to plaintiffs at artificially
high, and non-competitive levels, especially as compared with the prices
charged to mail- order pharmacies, managed care organizations and other
institutional buyers. The wholesalers’ motion for summary judgment in the
Individual Actions has been granted. Plaintiffs have appealed to the Seventh
Circuit. On May 6, 2002, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the summary judgment.

Most of the individual cases brought by chain stores have been settled.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation recommended remand of the
Sherman Act claims in MDL 997 and on November 2, 2001, the court remanded those
claims to their original jurisdictions.

A state court antitrust case against McKesson and other defendants is
currently pending in California. This case is based on essentially the same
facts alleged in the Federal Class Action and Individual Actions and asserts
violations of state antitrust and/or unfair competition laws. The case
(

Paradise Drugs, et al. v. Abbott Laboratories

,

et al.

, (Case No. CV793852) was
filed in the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara and was transferred to
the Superior Court for the County of San Francisco. The case is trailing MDL
997.

In each of the cases, plaintiffs seek remedies in the form of injunctive
relief and unquantified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.
Plaintiffs in the California cases also seek restitution. In addition, treble
damages are sought in the Individual Actions and the California case. We and
other wholesalers have entered into a judgment sharing agreement with certain
pharmaceutical manufacturer defendants, which provides generally that we,
together with the other wholesale distributor defendants, will be held harmless
by such pharmaceutical manufacturer defendants and will be indemnified against
the costs of adverse judgments, if any, against the wholesaler and
manufacturers in these or similar actions, in excess of $1 million in the
aggregate per wholesale distributor defendant.

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical, is one of many defendants in
approximately 138 cases in which plaintiffs claim that they were injured due to
exposure, over many years, to the latex proteins in gloves

manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of
distributors, including McKesson Medical-Surgical. Efforts to resolve tenders
of defense to its suppliers are continuing and a final agreement has been
reached with one major supplier. McKesson Medical-Surgical’s insurers are
providing coverage for these cases, subject to the applicable deductibles.

We, along with 134 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit brought
by the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (“the Foundation”)
alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven U.S. patents
relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the automated
management and control of product inventory, warehousing, distribution and
point-of-sale transactions. The Foundation seeks to enter into a license
agreement with us, the lump sum fee for which would be based upon a fraction of
a percent of our overall revenues over the past ten years. Due to the pendency
of earlier litigation brought against the Foundation attacking the validity of
the patents at issue, the court has stayed the action until the conclusion of
the earlier case.

III. Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses,
which were divested in 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations. We have received claims and demands from
governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly
required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at five sites
where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations; and we, by
administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain actions at those
sites, including soil and groundwater remediation.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with
outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of
reasonably possible remediation costs for these five sites is approximately $13
million, net of approximately $1.5 million which third parties have agreed to
pay in settlement or which we expect, based either on agreements or
nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third
parties. The $13 million is expected to be paid out between April 2002 and
March 2029. Our liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a potentially responsible party,
or PRP, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law or its state law
equivalent) for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our
alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 19 sites. With respect to each of
these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and, while the
current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon
PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with
other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 19 PRP sites is approximately $1.1
million. The aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in Superfund matters
to date have not been significant. The accompanying consolidated balance
sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain
due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup
costs; the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportion to other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs are
recover able from insurance or other parties.

Except as specifically stated above with respect to the litigation matters
summarized under “Accounting Litigation” above, we believe, based on current
knowledge and the advice of our counsel, that the outcome of the litigation and
governmental proceedings discussed under “Legal Proceedings” will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

20. Segments of Business

As discussed in Financial Note 1, our operating segments include
Pharmaceutical Solutions, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Information Solutions.
Effective for the year ended March 31, 2002, we expanded the number of
segments to include our Medical-Surgical business. Results of this
business were previously included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment,
formerly known as “Supply Solutions.” In addition, results for our MedPath
business (which distributes pharmaceutical products to physician offices and
oncology clinics) are now reported with our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.
These results were previously reported with our Medical-Surgical business. All
segment information has been conformed to this new presentation.

We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on operating
profit before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued
operations. Our Corporate segment includes expenses associated with Corporate
functions and projects, certain employee benefits, and our investment in Health
Nexis. Corporate expenses are allocated to the operating segments to the
extent that these items can be directly attributable to the segment.
