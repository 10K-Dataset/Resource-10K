McKESSON CORPORATION

Competition

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Pharmaceutical Solutions and
Medical-Surgical Solutions segments face strong competition, both in price and service, from
national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service
merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution and large
payor organizations. In addition, these segments face competition from various other service
providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers (as well as other potential
customers of the segments) which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal
needs, supply management capabilities which are provided by the segments and other competing
service providers. Price, quality of service, and, in some cases, convenience to the customer are
generally the principal competitive elements in these segments.

Our Provider Technologies segment experiences substantial competition from many firms,
including other computer services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain
hospitals and hospital groups, hardware vendors and Internet-based companies with technology
applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition varies in size from small to large companies,
in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.

Other Information About the Business

Customers:

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a
limited number of large customers. During 2006, sales to our largest customer, Caremark RX, Inc.,
and ten largest customers accounted for approximately 11% and 53% of our total consolidated
revenues. At March 31, 2006, accounts receivable from Caremark RX, Inc. and our ten largest
customers were approximately 11% and 48% of total accounts receivable. The majority of these
revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Suppliers:

Over the past few years, our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business has
encountered a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for the logistical,
capital and administrative services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Historically, a significant portion of compensation from the manufacturers was inflation-based. We
purchased and held pharmaceutical inventory in anticipation of manufacturers increasing their
prices. We benefited when the manufacturers increased their price as we sold the inventory being
held at the new higher price. Beginning in 2003, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to
assert control over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain by
restricting the volume of product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers.
Manufacturers also increasingly sought more data concerning product sales and distribution
patterns. We believe that the manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater
control over product supply and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity
by reducing the risks associated with product being available to, and distributed in, the secondary
market. These changes limited our ability to purchase inventory in advance of price increases. In
2005, manufacturers also reduced the number and average magnitude of price increases. As a result,
gross profit margin for our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business decreased in 2005 as compared
to 2004.

Commencing in the second half of 2005, we started revising some of our distribution
arrangements with the manufacturers. Under these new arrangements, a significant portion of our
compensation from the manufacturers is generated based on a percentage of purchases and, as a
result, we are no longer as dependent upon pharmaceutical price increases. These distribution
arrangements are, however, subject to compliance with various customary performance requirements.

By the end of 2005, our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business had transitioned or was in
the process of transitioning to these new distribution arrangements with almost all of the
manufacturers. This process was essentially completed in early 2006 and as a result, our buy side
margins increased in 2006. We continue to have certain distribution arrangements with
manufacturers that still include an inflation-based compensation component while other arrangements
remain structured under the historical inflation-based compensation model. For these
manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases as well as
restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us could adversely impact segment gross profit
margin.

In addition, with the transition to these new arrangements, purchases from certain of the
manufacturers are better aligned with customer demand and as a result, net financial inventory
(inventory, net of accounts payable) has decreased. This decrease has had a positive impact on our
cash flow from operations. These new arrangements also have somewhat diminished the seasonality of
gross profit margin which has historically reflected the pattern of manufacturers’ price increases.

Research and Development:

Our research and development (“R&D”) expenditures primarily consist
of our investment in software development held for sale. We expended $285 million, $232 million,
and $230 million for R&D activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004, and of these amounts, we capitalized
22%, 21% and 25%. R&D expenditures are primarily incurred by our Provider Technologies segment,
Payor Group and Retail Automation businesses. Our Provider Technologies segment’s product
development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific
information processing needs of hospitals. We believe a substantial and sustained commitment to
such expenditures is important to the long-term success of this business. Additional information
regarding our R&D activities is included in Financial Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, “Significant Accounting Policies,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Environmental Legislation:

We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained
responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection
Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed
sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 18, “Other Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than any capital expenditures that may be
required in connection with those legal matters, we do not anticipate making substantial capital
expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with environmental laws and regulations
in the future. The amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not
material in 2006 and is not expected to be material in the next year.

Employees:

On March 31, 2006, we employed approximately 26,400 persons compared to 25,200 in
2005 and 24,600 in 2004.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales:

Information as
to foreign operations is included in Financial Notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial
statements, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Segments of Business,” appearing in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Information regarding our risk factors is included in the Financial Review under the captions
“Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Statements” and “Additional Factors That May Affect Future
Results,” beginning on page 45 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties

Because of the nature of our principal businesses, plant, warehousing, office and other
facilities are operated in widely dispersed locations. The warehouses are typically owned or
leased on a long-term basis. We consider our operating properties to be in satisfactory condition
and adequate to meet our needs for the next several years without making capital expenditures
materially higher than historical levels. Information as to material lease commitments is included
in Financial Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, “Lease Obligations,” appearing in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Financial Note 18 to our
consolidated financial statements, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through the solicitation of proxies
or otherwise, during the three months ended March 31, 2006.

As a result of acquisitions, the Company currently has 14 assumed option plans under which

included in the table above.



McKESSON CORPORATION

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by the Company’s
stockholders. The plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
except for the portion of the 2005 Stock Plan related to Non-Employee Directors which is
administered by the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance.

2005 Stock Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”):

The 2005 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board of
Directors on May 25, 2005 and approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 27, 2005. The 2005
Stock Plan provides for the grant of up to 13 million shares, in the form of nonqualified stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted
stock unit awards, performance shares and other share-based awards. For any one share of common
stock issued in connection with a stock-settled stock appreciation right, restricted stock award,
restricted stock unit award, performance share or other share-based award, two shares shall be
deducted from the shares available for future grants. Shares of common stock not issued or
delivered as a result of the net exercise of a stock appreciation right or option, shares used to
pay the withholding taxes related to a stock award, or shares repurchased on the open market with
proceeds from the exercise of options shall not be returned to the reserve of shares available for
issuance under the 2005 Stock Plan.

Options are granted at not less than fair market value and have a term of seven years.
Options generally become exercisable in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the
grant date, or after four years from the date of grant. The award or vesting of restricted stock,
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or performance shares may be conditioned upon the attainment of one
or more performance objectives. Vesting of such awards is generally a three year cliff.

Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of up to 5,000 RSUs, currently set at 2,500
RSUs, which vest immediately, however payment of any shares is delayed until the director is no
longer performing services for the Company. The 2005 Stock Plan replaced the 1997 Non-Employee
Directors Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.

1973 Stock Purchase Plan (the “SPP”):

The SPP was adopted by the stockholders of the Company’s
predecessor in 1973. The Company’s stockholders approved an additional 2.5 million shares to be
issued under the SPP in 1999, which remain available for issuance. Rights to purchase shares are
granted under the SPP to key employees of the Company as determined by the Compensation Committee
of the Board. The purchase price, to be paid in cash or using promissory notes of the Company’s
common stock, subject to rights granted under the SPP, is the fair market value of such stock on
the date the right is exercised.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”):

The ESPP is intended to qualify as an
“employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. In
March 2002, the Board amended the ESPP to allow for participation in the plan by employees of
certain of the Company’s international and other subsidiaries. As to those employees, the ESPP
does not so qualify

.

Currently, 11.1 million shares have been authorized for issuance under the
ESPP.

The ESPP is implemented through a continuous series of three month purchase periods (“Purchase
Periods”) during which contributions can be made toward the purchase of common stock under the
plan.

Each eligible employee may elect to authorize regular payroll deductions during the next
succeeding Purchase Period, the amount of which may not exceed 15% of a participant’s compensation.
At the end of each Purchase Period, the funds withheld by each participant will be used to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of each share of the Company’s
common stock is based on 85% of the fair market value of each share on the last day of the
applicable Purchase Period. In general, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be
purchased by a participant for each Purchase Period is determined by dividing $12,500 by the fair
market value of one share of common stock on the offering date.



McKESSON CORPORATION

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have not been submitted for approval by
the Company’s stockholders:

On July 27, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2005 Stock Plan which had the effect
of terminating the 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, the 1998 Canadian Stock Incentive
Plan, the Stock Option Plans Adopted in January 1999 and August 1999, which plans had not been
submitted for approval by the Company’s stockholders, and the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity
Compensation and Deferral Plan, which had previously been approved by the Company’s stockholders.
Prior grants under these plans include stock options, restricted stock and RSUs. Stock options
under the terminated plans generally have a ten-year life and vest over four years. Restricted
stock contains certain restrictions on transferability and may not be transferred until such
restrictions lapse. Each of these plans has outstanding equity grants, which are subject to the
terms and conditions of their respective plans, but no new grants will be made under these
terminated plans.

1999 Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999 SPP”):

The 1999 SPP was adopted by the Board of
Directors in February 1999. The 1999 SPP provided for the grant of rights to purchase a maximum of
0.7 million shares of common stock subject to the NYSE limits. No further grants will be made from
the 1999 SPP. Rights to purchase shares were granted under the 1999 SPP to eligible employees of
the Company. The purchase price, to be paid in cash or using promissory notes, for the Company’s
common stock subject to rights granted under the 1999 SPP was equal to the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock on the date the right was exercised (which was the closing price of the
Company’s common stock on the NYSE). Purchases were evidenced by written stock purchase agreements
which provide for the payment of the purchase price by (i) payment in cash, or (ii) a promissory
note payable on a repayment schedule determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board, or
(iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).

HBOC 1994 UK Sharesave Scheme (the “1994 Scheme”):

In connection with the acquisition by the
Company of HBO & Company (“HBOC”), we assumed the HBOC 1994 Scheme, which is similar to the ESPP,
under which approximately 0.2 million shares remain available for issuance. Employees and previous
directors of HBOC and its subsidiaries, who are residents of the United Kingdom, are eligible to
receive options under the 1994 Scheme. The exercise price of the stock covered by each option
shall not be less than 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date the
option is granted. Participants under the 1994 Scheme pay for options through monthly
contributions, subject to minimum and maximum monthly limits. We no longer offer any new options
under the 1994 Scheme.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition

GENERAL

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition,
referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and
assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial
position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes.
The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all
references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

We conduct our business through three operating segments: Pharmaceutical Solutions,
Medical-Surgical Solutions and Provider Technologies. See Financial Note 1 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting Policies,” for a description of these
segments.

Revenues increased 10% to $88.1 billion and 16% to $80.1 billion in 2006 and 2005. The
increase in revenues primarily reflects growth in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which
accounted for 95% of our consolidated revenues. Increases in 2006 revenue for this segment were
largely the result of our acquisition of D&K Healthcare Resources, Inc. (“D&K”) in August 2005 and
growth among existing customers. Increases in 2005 revenue for this segment were also the result
of expanded agreements with certain existing customers, market rate growth, as well as new
customers.

Gross profit increased 12% to $3.9 billion and 7% to $3.5 billion in 2006 and 2005. As a
percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 8 basis points (“bp”) in 2006 and declined 36 bp in
2005. Our 2006, 2005 and 2004 gross profit includes the receipt of $95 million, $41 million and
$22 million of cash proceeds representing our share of settlements of antitrust class action
lawsuits. Gross profit margin increased by 5 bp and 3 bp in 2006 and 2005 as a result of these
settlements. The decrease in our 2005 gross profit margin primarily reflects pressure on our buy
side margin as well as declines in our sell margin due to a shift in customer mix and competitive
pressures within our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.

Operating expenses were $2.7 billion, $3.6 billion and $2.3 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004.
Operating expenses for 2006 and 2005 include $45 million and $1.2 billion in pre-tax charges for
our Securities Litigation. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 3.12%, 4.55% and
3.26% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, or 3.07% and 3.05% in 2006 and 2005, excluding the Securities
Litigation charges. Excluding the Securities Litigation charges, operating expenses as a
percentage of revenues for 2005 declined mainly due to leveraging of our fixed cost infrastructure
and productivity improvements in back-office and field operations. Operating expense dollars
decreased in 2006 and increased in 2005 primarily due to our Securities Litigation charges,
additional costs to support our sales volume growth and, for 2006, increased research and
development expenditures and expenses associated with the D&K business. Operating expenses were
also impacted by a number of other significant items which are discussed later in further detail,
including a $66 million credit pertaining to the reversal of a portion of customer settlement
reserves within our Provider Technologies segment in 2004.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,158 million, ($245)
million and $906 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, reflecting the above noted factors. 2006 income
before income taxes from continuing operations also benefited from increases in interest income due
to our favorable cash balances as well as a decrease in interest expense.

On an operating segment basis, results for 2006 reflect revenue growth and an increase in
gross profit margin in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which includes the receipt of a larger
amount of antitrust settlements, and improved operating profit in our Provider Technologies
segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in operating profit in our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. Results for 2005 primarily reflect revenue growth and a
decline in gross profit margin in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment as well as a decrease in
operating profit in our Provider Technologies segment.

Our reported income tax rates were 36.4%, 34.7% and 29.0% in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Increases
in our reported income tax rates primarily reflect a lower proportion of income attributed to
foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In addition, income tax benefit for 2005
includes an $85 million reserve for future resolution of uncertain tax matters related to our
Securities Litigation and income tax expense for 2004 includes $23 million of tax benefits relating
to favorable settlements and adjustments.

Net income (loss) was $751 million, ($157) million and $647 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004 and
diluted earnings (loss) per share was $2.38, ($0.53) and $2.19. Excluding the Securities
Litigation charges, net income and net income per diluted share for 2006 would have been $781
million and $2.48, and for 2005, $653 million and $2.19. In addition to the factors discussed
above, net income for 2006 also reflects a $13 million after-tax gain, or $0.04 per diluted share,
relating to the disposal of a wholly-owned subsidiary.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

U.S. Healthcare pharmaceutical direct distribution and service revenues increased in 2006
primarily reflecting our acquisition of D&K and growth among existing customers. In 2005,
increases in these revenues primarily reflect market growth rates, new institutional customers as
well as growth from existing institutional customers, which includes mail-order businesses. In
early 2005, we implemented a new pharmaceutical distribution contract with the Department of
Veterans Affairs, which significantly contributed to the segment’s total increase in revenues.
Market growth rates reflect growing drug utilization and price increases, which are offset in part
by the increased use of lower priced generics.

U.S. Healthcare sales to customers’ warehouses increased over the last two years primarily as
a result of greater volume to, and expanded agreements with, existing customers. Partially
offsetting these increases was the loss of certain volume from a warehouse customer in 2006. Sales
to customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited
number of large self-warehousing customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer,
receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver
the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our
customer warehouses. These sales provide a benefit to our customers in that they can use one
source for both their direct store-to-store business and their warehouse business. We have
significantly lower gross profit margin on these sales as we pass much of the efficiencies of this
low cost-to-serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross
profit dollars.

Canadian pharmaceutical distribution revenues increased over the last two years reflecting
market growth rates and favorable exchange rates. In addition, revenues for 2005 benefited from
new business from manufacturers which formerly engaged in direct distribution activities. Had the
same U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rates applied in 2006 as in 2005 (“constant currency
basis”), revenues from our Canadian operations would have increased approximately 7% in 2006. On a
constant currency basis, revenues from our Canadian operations would have increased approximately
10% in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Medical-Surgical Solutions distribution revenues increased in 2006 primarily reflecting market
growth rates. Revenues in this segment increased slightly in 2005 as growth in alternate site
revenues exceeded a decline in acute care revenues. Increases in our alternate site revenues
include Moore Medical Corporation (“MMC”), which we acquired in early 2005. MMC is an
Internet-enabled, multi-channel marketer and distributor of medical-surgical and pharmaceutical
products to non-hospital provider settings. Declines in our acute care revenues reflect the loss
of the segment’s largest customer in the second half of 2004.

Provider Technologies revenues increased over the last two years primarily reflecting higher
sales and implementations of clinical, imaging and automation solutions. Growth in this segment’s
revenues was not materially impacted by business acquisitions.

Gross profit increased 12% to $3.9 billion in 2006 and 7% to $3.5 billion in 2005. As a
percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 8 bp in 2006 and declined 36 bp in 2005. Increases
in our gross profit dollars were mainly due to our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and
additionally, to a lesser extent for 2006, due to our Provider Technologies segment. In 2005, our
gross profit margin was negatively impacted by our higher proportion of revenues attributable to
our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which has lower margins relative to other segments. In
addition, our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment gross profit margin improved in 2006 compared to
2005 and declined in 2005 compared with 2004. Changes in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment’s
gross profit margin were due to:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Gross profit margin in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment decreased in 2006 primarily
reflecting pressure on our supplier and customer margins and a $15 million asset impairment charge.
In 2005, the segment entered into an agreement with a third party vendor to sell the vendor’s
proprietary software and services. The terms of the contract required us to prepay certain
royalties. In 2006, we ended the marketing and sale of the software under the contract. As a
result of this decision, we recorded a $15 million charge to cost of sales to write-off the
remaining balance of the prepaid royalties. Gross profit margin for this segment increased in 2005
primarily due to a higher proportion of alternate site revenues.

Gross profit margins were flat in 2006 and decreased in 2005 in our Provider Technologies
segment. The decrease in our 2005 gross profit margin primarily reflects a greater mix of revenue
associated with clinical products which, because of their complexity, have a higher cost of
installation and support than other more established products.

Operating expenses decreased 25% to $2.7 billion in 2006 and increased 61% to $3.6 billion in
2005. Operating expenses for 2006 and 2005 include $45 million and $1.2 billion in pre-tax charges
for our Securities Litigation. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased 143 bp to
3.12% in 2006 and increased 129 bp to 4.55% in 2005 from 3.26% in 2004 (or 3.07% and 3.05% in 2006
and 2005, excluding the Securities Litigation charges). Excluding the Securities Litigation
charges, increases in operating expenses were primarily due to additional expenses incurred to
support our sales volume growth, including distribution expenses and higher foreign currency
exchange rates for our Canadian operations and increased research and development expenditures.
Operating expenses were also impacted by our acquisitions of D&K in 2006 and MMC in 2005, and by a
$66 million credit pertaining to the reversal of a portion of customer settlement reserves in 2004.
Excluding the Securities Litigation charges, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for
2005 declined mainly due to leveraging of our fixed cost infrastructure and productivity
improvements in back-office and field operations.

Operating expenses included the following significant items:


–

a $45 million net charge for our Securities Litigation and a decrease in legal expenses associated with the litigation
which were recorded in Corporate expenses, and

–

a $15 million credit to bad debt expense due to a recovery of a previously reserved customer account.


–

a $1.2 billion charge for our Securities Litigation and an increase in legal expenses associated with the litigation
which were recorded in Corporate expenses, and

–

approximately $12 million of settlement charges pertaining to a non-qualified pension plan, which were primarily
included in Corporate expenses. In 2005, we made several lump sum cash payments totaling approximately $42 million
from an unfunded U.S. pension plan. In accordance with accounting standards, additional charges for settlements
associated with lump sum payments of pension obligations were expensed in the period in which the payments were made.

Segment operating profit includes gross margin, net of operating expenses, and other income
for our three business segments. In addition to the significant items previously discussed,
operating profit increased in 2006 primarily reflecting revenue growth and an increase in gross
profit margin in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and improved operating profit in our Provider
Technologies segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in operating profit in
our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. Increases in operating profit for 2005 reflect revenue
growth and increased operating profit in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, partially offset by
lower operating profit in our Medical-Surgical Solutions and Provider Technologies segments.

Operating profit as a percentage of revenues increased in 2006 in our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment reflecting an increase in gross profit margins, including the increase in receipt of
antitrust settlements, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of
revenues. Operating expenses increased in both dollars and as a percentage of revenues due to
additional costs incurred to support our revenue growth as well as due to the addition of D&K’s
operating and integration expenses. Operating profit for this segment also benefited from a $15
million credit to bad debt expense due to a recovery on a previously reserved customer account and
from an increase in equity earnings from our investment in Nadro. Operating profit as a percentage
of revenues decreased in 2005 primarily reflecting a net decline in gross margins, offset in part
with cost reductions by leveraging the segment’s fixed cost infrastructure, productivity
improvements in back-office and field operations, and an improvement in bad debt expense. In 2004,
operating profit for this segment included a $30 million bad debt provision for a customer
bankruptcy.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment’s operating profit as a percentage of revenues declined
over the past two years. The decline in the segment’s 2006 operating profit as a percentage of
revenues primarily reflects lower gross profit margins, including a $15 million asset impairment
charge, as well as an increase in bad debt expense. The decline in the segment’s 2005 operating
profit as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects an increase in gross profit margins which
were more than offset by a higher proportion of operating expenses. Operating expenses increased
in 2005, in both dollars and as a percentage of revenues, primarily due to the acquisition of MMC
and a higher proportion of costs incurred to serve the segment’s alternate site customers, which
have a higher cost-to-serve ratio than the segment’s other customers. Operating profit for 2005
was also impacted by the lack of flu vaccine supply as well as an $7 million charge to operating
expenses due to an increase in litigation reserves. The Company has
decided to explore its strategic options with regard to the acute
care portion of this segment’s business.

Provider Technologies segment’s operating profit as a percentage of revenues increased in 2006
primarily reflecting favorable operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating expenses
for this segment increased primarily due to investments in research and development activities and
sales functions to support the segment’s revenue growth and to a lesser extent, due to the
acquisition of Medcon, Ltd. (“Medcon”). Partially offsetting these increases, operating profit
benefited from a reduction in bad debt expense. Operating profit as a percentage of revenues for
this segment declined in 2005 primarily reflecting a decrease in gross profit margin as well as an
increase in operating expenses to support the segment’s revenue growth and a decrease in customer
settlement reserve reversals. In 2004, the segment recorded $66 million of reversals of customer
settlement reserves.

During the first quarter of 2007, the segment anticipates incurring restructuring charges of
approximately $6 million to $8 million as a result of a reorganization announced early in the
quarter designed to reallocate product development and marketing resources.

Corporate expenses, net of other income, decreased in 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in
interest income and a decrease in legal costs associated with our Securities Litigation. These
favorable variances were partially offset by additional costs incurred to support various
initiatives. Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2005 primarily reflecting
incremental legal costs due to the acceleration of activity in our Securities Litigation,
settlement charges pertaining to lump-sum cash payments from an unfunded U.S. pension plan, a
decrease in gains on sales of surplus properties and additional administrative expenses incurred to
support various initiatives. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher interest
income and a decrease in expenses associated with charges for loans made to former employees. In
2004, expenses reflect a $21 million charge for uncollected balances on loans made to former
employees for the purchase of McKesson common stock primarily in February 1999. Legal costs
associated with our Securities Litigation were $27 million, $43 million and $18 million in 2006,
2005 and 2004.

Securities Litigation Charges, Net:

As discussed in Financial Note 18, “Other Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the third
quarter of 2005, we announced that we had reached an agreement to settle the action captioned

In re
McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation

(the “Consolidated Action”). In general, under the
agreement to settle the Consolidated Action, we agreed to pay the settlement class a total of $960
million in cash. The settlement agreement was subject to various conditions, including, but not
limited to, preliminary approval by the court, notice to the Class, and final approval by the court
after a hearing. Other than the Consolidated Action, none of the previously reported Securities
Litigation was resolved by the settlement date. As a result, during the third quarter of 2005, we
recorded a $1,200 million pre-tax ($810 million after-tax) charge with respect to the Company’s
Securities Litigation. The charge consisted of $960 million for the Consolidated Action and $240
million for other Securities Litigation proceedings.

During 2006, we settled many of the other Securities Litigation proceedings and paid $243
million pursuant to those settlements. Based on the payments made in the Consolidated Action and
the other Securities Litigation proceedings, settlements reached in certain of the other Securities
Litigation proceedings and our assessment of the remaining cases, the estimated reserves were
increased by $52 million and $1 million in pre-tax charges during the first and third quarters of
2006 and decreased by an $8 million pre-tax credit during the fourth quarter of 2006, for a total
net pre-tax charge of $45 million for 2006. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, the Securities
Litigation accrual was $1,014 million and $1,214 million. Additionally, on February 24, 2006, the
court gave final approval to the settlement of the Consolidated Action, and as a result, we paid
approximately $960 million into an escrow account established by the lead plaintiff in connection
with the settlement of the Consolidated Action.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We believe this accrual is adequate to address our remaining potential exposure with respect
to all of the Securities Litigation matters. However, in view of the number of remaining cases, the
uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial amounts
involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters could impact our earnings, either
negatively or positively, in the quarter of their resolution. We do not believe that the
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial position taken as a whole.

Income Taxes:

Our reported tax rate was 36.4%, 34.7% and 29.0% in 2006, 2005 and 2004. In
addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to
changes within state and foreign tax rates resulting from our business mix, including varying
proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates.

In 2006, we recorded a $14 million income tax expense which primarily relates to a basis
adjustment in an investment and adjustments with various taxing authorities.

In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of $390 million for the
Securities Litigation. We believe the pending settlement of the Consolidated Action and the
ultimate resolution of the lawsuits brought independently by other shareholders will be tax
deductible. However, the tax attributes of the litigation are complex and the Company expects
challenges from the taxing authorities, and accordingly such deductions will not be finalized until
all the lawsuits are concluded and an examination of the Company’s tax returns is completed.
Accordingly, as of March 31, 2005, we provided a reserve of $85 million for future resolution of
these uncertain tax matters. This reserve was increased to $88 million by March 31, 2006. While
we believe the tax reserve is adequate, the ultimate resolution of these tax matters may exceed or
be below the reserve.

In 2005, we also recorded a $10 million income tax benefit arising primarily from settlements
and adjustments with various taxing authorities and a $3 million income tax benefit primarily due
to a reduction of a valuation allowance related to state income tax net operating loss
carryforwards. We believe that the income tax benefit from a portion of these state net operating
loss carryforwards will now be realized.

In 2004, we recorded a $23 million tax benefit relating to favorable tax settlements and
adjustments with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and with various taxing authorities. A large
portion of this benefit, which was not previously recognized by the Company, resulted from the
filing of amended tax returns by our subsidiary, McKesson Information Solutions LLC (formerly known
as HBO & Company) for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.

Discontinued Operation:

In 2006, we sold a wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson BioServices
Corporation (“BioServices”), for net proceeds of $63 million. The divestiture resulted in an
after-tax gain of $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share. The results of BioServices’ operations
have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Financial results for this business were previously included in
our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and were not material to our consolidated financial
statements.

Net Income:

Net income (loss) was $751 million, ($157) million and $647 million in 2006, 2005
and 2004 and diluted earnings (loss) per share was $2.38, ($0.53) and $2.19. Excluding the
Securities Litigation charges, 2006 net income and net income per diluted share would have been
$781 million and $2.48, and for 2005, $653 million and $2.19.

For 2006 and 2005, interest expense, net of related income taxes, of $1 million and $6
million, has been added to net income, excluding the Securities Litigation charges, for
purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share. This calculation also includes the impact
of dilutive securities (stock options, convertible junior subordinated debentures and
restricted stock).

These
pro forma amounts are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these
measures internally and consider these results to be useful to
investors as they provide the most relevant benchmarks of core
operating performance.

Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding:

Diluted earnings (loss) per share was
calculated based on an average number of shares outstanding of 316 million, 294 million and 299
million for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2006 primarily
reflect an increase in the number of common shares outstanding as a result of exercised stock
options, net of treasury stock repurchased, as well as an increase in the common stock equivalents
from stock options due to the increase in the Company’s common stock price. For 2005, potentially
dilutive securities were excluded from the per share computations due to their antidilutive effect.

International Operations

International operations accounted for 6.9%, 6.8% and 6.7% of 2006, 2005 and 2004 consolidated
revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations.
We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political
environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our
international operations is also included in Financial Note 21, “Segments of Business” to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Restructuring Activities

In 2005 and 2004, we were still managing a 2001/2000 restructuring plan associated with
customer settlements for the discontinuance of overlapping and nonstrategic products and other
product development projects within our Provider Technologies segment. Customer settlement
reserves were established, reviewed and assessed on a customer and contract specific basis, and
actual settlements for each customer varied significantly depending on the specific mix and number
of products, and each customer contract or contracts. In 2004, we had significant customer
settlement activity, including the completion and execution of a number of the more difficult
settlements. As of March 31, 2004, we were substantially complete with our settlements and as a
result, the customer settlement reserve was reduced by $66 million. In 2005, the reserves were
further reduced by $4 million based on additional favorable settlements. There were no significant
offsetting changes in estimates that increase the provision for customer settlements. Total cash
and non-cash settlements of $45 million and $96 million have been incurred since the inception of
this restructuring plan. Non-cash settlements represent write-offs of customer receivables. As of
March 31, 2005, accrued customer settlement reserves were not material to our consolidated
financial statements and the restructuring plan was essentially completed.

Refer to Financial Note 5, “Restructuring Activities,” to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for further discussion regarding our restructuring activities.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Acquisitions and Investments

We made the following acquisitions and investments:

During the last three years we also completed a number of other acquisitions and investments
within all three of our operating segments. Purchase prices have been allocated based on estimated
fair values at the date of acquisition and, for certain recent acquisitions, may be subject to change.
Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the
effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or
aggregate basis.

Refer to Financial Note 2, “Acquisitions and Investments,” to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for further discussions regarding our acquisitions and investing activities.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

2007 Outlook

Information regarding the Company’s 2007 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 4,
2006. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections “Factors Affecting
Forward-looking Statements” and “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results” included in
this Financial Review.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make
assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if
different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the
accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a
material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates
that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition.
Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such
estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Receivables:

We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to
customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing relates to guarantees
provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories and lease
and credit financing. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based
on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our
customers. An allowance is recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.

If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition
or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require
adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer
financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. In addition, in
2006, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of our total consolidated
revenues. Sales to our largest customer, Caremark RX, Inc., represented approximately 11% of our
2006 total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2006, accounts receivable from our ten largest
customers and Caremark RX, Inc. were approximately 48% and 11% of total accounts receivable. As a
result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. Any defaults in payment or a material
reduction in purchases from this or any other large customer could have a significant negative
impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

At March 31, 2006, trade and notes receivables were $5,980 million, and other customer
financing was $197 million, prior to allowances of $168 million. In 2006, 2005 and 2004 our
provision for bad debts was $13 million, $16 million and $54 million. The decrease in our
provision for bad debts in 2005 was primarily attributed to better accounts receivable management
and due to a $30 million expense recorded in 2004 as a result of a customer bankruptcy. At March
31, 2006 and 2005, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 2.1%.
Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II
included in this annual report on Form

10-K.

Inventories:

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. Inventories for our
Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments consist of merchandise held for
resale. For our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories
was determined on the LIFO method and international inventories are stated using the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost of inventories for our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment was
primarily determined on the FIFO method. Provider Technologies’ inventories consist of computer
hardware with cost determined either by the specific identification or the FIFO method. Total
inventories were $7.3 billion and $7.5 billion at March 31, 2006 and 2005.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The LIFO method was used to value approximately 85% to 90% of our inventories at March 31,
2006 and 2005. If the FIFO method, which approximates replacement cost, had been applied, total
inventories would have increased $155 million and $187 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005. In
addition, we recorded LIFO reserve adjustments of benefits of $32 million and $59 million in 2006
and 2005, and an expense of $28 million in 2004. LIFO adjustments generally represent the net
effect of the amount of price increases on branded pharmaceutical products held in inventory offset
by price declines on generic pharmaceutical products, including the price decrease effect of
branded pharmaceutical products that have lost patent protection. A LIFO benefit implies that the
price declines on generic pharmaceutical products, including the effect of branded pharmaceuticals
that have lost patent protection, exceeded the effect of price increases on branded pharmaceutical
products held in inventory.

In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including
estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase
obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer
preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products, or the loss of
one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories.
These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.

Acquisitions:

We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting
which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of
acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired
in-process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition. The judgments made in
determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for
significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists. The
valuations are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on
expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management.

There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. For intangible assets we typically use the income method. This method starts
with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows. These cash flows are then adjusted
to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated
with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the
income method or other methods include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; the
discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment
of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration
of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of
an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have
different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.

Goodwill:

We have significant goodwill assets as a result of acquiring businesses. We
account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires us to maintain goodwill assets on our
books unless the assets are deemed to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill
balances annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Such impairment tests require that we
first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the
operations in which goodwill is assigned. If carrying value exceeds fair value, a second step
would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment. Fair values can be determined using
market, income or cost approaches. To estimate the fair value of a business using the market
approach, we compare the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are
actively traded in public markets; or the income approach, where we use a discounted cash flow
model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of
that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment
estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline
companies, the determination of market value multiples for the guideline companies and the
subsequent selection of an appropriate market value multiple for the business based on a comparison
of the business to the guideline companies, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts
based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and when
considering the income approach, include the required rate of return used in the discounted cash
flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the
business. Other estimates inherent in the income approach include long-term growth rates and cash
flow forecasts for the business.

A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events
and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The
judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value can materially impact our results of
operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and
are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any
changes in key assumptions, including unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the
accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge.
Goodwill at March 31, 2006 and 2005 was $1,718 million and $1,439 million and we concluded that
there was no impairment in our goodwill.

Securities Litigation:

As discussed in Financial Note 18, “Other Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the third quarter of 2005,
we announced that we had reached an agreement to settle the action captioned

In re McKesson HBOC,
Inc. Securities Litigation

(the “Consolidated Action”). In general, under the agreement to settle
the Consolidated Action, we agreed to pay the settlement class a total of $960 million in cash.
The settlement agreement was subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to,
preliminary approval by the court, notice to the Class, and final approval by the court after a
hearing. Other than the Consolidated Action, none of the previously reported Securities Litigation
was resolved by the settlement date. As a result, during the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a
$1,200 million pre-tax ($810 million after-tax) charge with respect to the Company’s Securities
Litigation. The charge consisted of $960 million for the Consolidated Action and $240 million for
other Securities Litigation proceedings.

During 2006, we settled many of the other Securities Litigation proceedings and paid $243
million pursuant to those settlements. Based on the payments made in the Consolidated Action and
the other Securities Litigation proceedings, settlements reached in certain of the other Securities
Litigation proceedings and our assessment of the remaining cases, the estimated reserves were
increased by $52 million and $1 million in pre-tax charges during the first and third quarters of
2006 and decreased by an $8 million pre-tax credit during the fourth quarter of 2006, for a total
net pre-tax charge of $45 million for 2006. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, the Securities
Litigation accrual was $1,014 million and $1,214 million. Additionally, on February 24, 2006, the
court gave final approval to the settlement of the Consolidated Action, and as a result, we paid
approximately $960 million into an escrow account established by the lead plaintiff in connection
with the settlement of the Consolidated Action.

In addition, for the litigation costs not covered under our directors and officers’ liability
insurance policies, we accrue costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. We recorded $27 million, $43 million and $18 million of such
expenses in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

We believe our accrual is adequate to address our remaining potential exposure with respect to
all of the Securities Litigation matters. However, in view of the number of remaining cases, the
uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial amounts
involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters could impact our earnings, either
negatively or positively, in the quarter of their resolution. We do not believe that the
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial position taken as a whole.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Supplier Reserves:

We establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to
various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments
otherwise due to them from us. These reserve estimates are established based on our best judgment
after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with
the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us.
We evaluate amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates
when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. The ultimate outcome of any
outstanding claim may be different than our estimate.

Income Taxes:

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required in determining the estimated worldwide provision for income taxes.
During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues
based on estimates of whether additional amounts will be due. As of March 31, 2006, approximately
$274 million has been accrued for such matters. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact
the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.

As discussed in Financial Note 16, “Income Taxes,” we recorded an income tax benefit of $390
million relating to the Securities Litigation in the third quarter of 2005. We believe the pending
settlement of the Consolidated Action and the ultimate resolution of the lawsuits brought
independently by other shareholders will be tax deductible. However, the tax attributes of the
litigation are complex and the Company expects challenges from the taxing authorities, and
accordingly such deductions will not be finalized until all the lawsuits are concluded and an
examination of the Company’s tax returns is completed. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2005, we
provided a reserve of $85 million for future resolution of these uncertain tax matters. This
reserve was increased to $88 million in 2006 and is included in the Company’s total income tax
reserves. While we believe the tax reserve is adequate, the ultimate resolution of these tax
matters may exceed or be below the reserve.

Contract Accounting:

We use the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize
certain revenues and costs, primarily for long-term software contracts within our Provider
Technologies segment. This method of accounting requires us to estimate the timing and amounts of
total revenue to be earned and total costs to be incurred over the life of a contract. Revenue
estimates are derived primarily from negotiated contract prices modified by assumptions regarding
change orders, contract arrangements and assumptions regarding penalty provisions associated with
technical performance. Revenues are recorded based on the percentage of costs incurred to date
compared to the most recent estimate of total costs to complete each contract. Cost estimates are
based primarily on the expected amount of resources required to complete the contract.

The estimated revenue to be earned and costs to complete a project can change significantly
throughout the period of a contract. Factors that could change estimates include, but are not
limited to, the ability to successfully complete milestones, the timing of milestones, and
modifications in the amount of resources or other costs required to complete the project. Changes
in estimates to complete, and revisions in overall profit estimates on percentage of completion
contracts, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract
losses if and when the current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.
Such a provision is subject to change as additional information is obtained and as contracts
progress towards completion. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, adjustments to earnings resulting from
revisions to estimates on these contracts have not been material to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Share-Based
Payment:

Our compensation programs include share-based payments. Stock options,
which entitle the holder to purchase shares of McKesson’s common stock at a pre-determined price at
the end of a vesting term, are accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” an elective accounting policy permitted by SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Under this policy, since the exercise price of
stock options we grant is generally set equal to the market price on the date of the grant, we do
not record any expense to the income statement related to the grants of stock options, unless
certain original grant-date terms are subsequently modified.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

For disclosure purposes only, we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the
value of an employee stock option. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates
of factors we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain
events. The key factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected term of
the option, the expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield. We
continue to use historical exercise patterns as our best estimate of future exercise patterns in
determining our expected term of the option. In 2006, we began using a combination of historical
and quoted implied volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe
that this market-based input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is
consistent with emerging employee stock option valuation considerations. Our expected stock price
volatility assumption continues to reflect a constant dividend yield during the expected term of
the option. Once employee stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not
permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual.

The pro forma effect on net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the
years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is set forth in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting
Policies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, under the caption “Share-Based
Payment.” In addition, beginning in 2007, we will report the value of stock options in our income
statement. See our discussion in the “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” section of this
Financial Review.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits:

We provide defined benefit pension plans or
defined contribution plans for the majority of our employees worldwide. In the U.S., we have both
qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as
well as other postretirement benefit plans, consisting primarily of healthcare and life insurance
for retirees. Our non-qualified U.S. retirement plans and our other postretirement benefit plans,
which are provided to certain employees, are unfunded obligations.

In 2006 and 2005, we made contributions of $7 million and $46 million to our U.S.
non-qualified pension plans. In the aggregate, our U.S. qualified pension plans are overfunded on
an accumulated benefit obligation measurement basis as of March 31, 2006 and 2005. Outside the
U.S., in general, we fund our defined benefit plans to the extent that tax or other incentives
exist and similar to our U.S. non-qualified pension plans, we have accrued liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheets to reflect those plans that are not fully funded.

The accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and
calculations which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties.
The assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the employee benefit obligations for
the defined benefit and postretirement plans, include discount rate, expected salary increases,
certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (life expectancy),
expected return on assets and healthcare cost trend rates. We evaluate these critical assumptions
at least annually. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our best judgment
regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made
in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations. As
such, we obtain assistance from actuarial experts to aid in developing reasonable assumptions and
cost estimates. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions
because of economic and other factors. The effects of actual results differing from our
assumptions are included in unamortized net gain and loss, which is amortized over future periods.

Our weighted-average assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our
pension plans, which determines net periodic benefit cost, was 8.2% and 8.2% for 2006 and 2005.
The weighted-average assumption for the expected return on assets for our plans reflects our actual
historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by
asset class, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the
implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans. Our target asset
allocation is determined based on the risk tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may
be adjusted to achieve our overall investment objective. The weighted average discount rate used
in calculating our pension benefit obligations at March 31, 2006, is 5.6%, which represents a 20 bp
decline from our March 31, 2005 rate of 5.8%. A lower discount rate increases the present value of
benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The discount rate for our defined benefit and
postretirement plans is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality
corporate bonds rated AA or better for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the
estimated payouts of the plans.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,744 million in 2006, compared with $1,538
million in 2005 and $595 million in 2004. Net cash flow from operations in 2006 and 2005 increased
primarily reflecting improved working capital balances for our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution
business as purchases from certain of our suppliers are better aligned with customer demand and as
a result, net financial inventory (inventory, net of accounts payable) decreased. Operating
activities for 2006 also benefited from better inventory management. Cash flows from operations
can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments
to vendors. Operating activities for 2006 include a $143 million cash receipt in connection with
an amended agreement entered into with a customer and cash settlement payments of $243 million for
the Securities Litigation. Additionally, cash flows from operations for 2006 include a reduction
in current income taxes payable and a reduction in our deferred tax
assets which largely pertains to our Securities Litigation cash
settlement payments (including the $960 million placed in escrow), which will be deducted in our 2006 income return. Net cash
flow from operating activities in 2005 includes a $1,200 million non-cash ($810 million after-tax)
charge for the Securities Litigation. In 2005, working capital levels also benefited from
favorable receivable terms on our then new contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs and
improved accounts receivable management. Partially offsetting our net working capital decreases is
increased working capital associated with revenue growth, including our contract with the
Department of Veterans Affairs. Included in our 2005 net cash flow from operating activities is
$40 million of cash provided to a customer in exchange for a note receivable and the cancellation
of a credit facility guarantee and another guarantee in favor of this customer.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1,825 million in 2006, compared with $355 million
in 2005 and $300 million in 2004. Investing activities for 2006 include increases in property
acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures which primarily reflect our investment in our
U.S. pharmaceutical distribution center network and our Provider Technologies segment’s investment
in software for a contract with the British government’s National Health Services Information
Authority organization. Investing activities for 2006 also include $603 million of expenditures
for our business acquisitions, including D&K and Medcon, and a
use of cash of $962 million due to a
transfer of cash to an escrow account for future payment of our Securities Litigation. Partially
offsetting these increases were cash proceeds of $63 million pertaining to the sale of BioServices.
Investing activities for 2005 include $109 million of business acquisition expenditures, primarily
for the acquisition of MMC and the increased investment in Nadro. Investing activities for 2005
also reflect a higher level of property acquisitions which primarily reflect improvements to our
warehouse distribution and information technology networks.

Financing activities utilized cash of $577 million, $91 million and $109 million in 2006, 2005
and 2004. Financing activities for 2006 include $958 million of cash paid for stock repurchases
and $102 million of cash paid for the repayment of life insurance policy loans, which was partially
offset by $568 million of cash receipts from common stock issuances. Financing activities for 2005
include repayment of $268 million of long-term debt partially offset by $223 million of cash
receipts from common stock issuances. Financing activities for 2004 include $157 million of stock
repurchases partially offset by $93 million of cash receipts from the issuance of common stock and
the receipt of $33 million pertaining to the collection of employee loans. Cash received from
common stock issuances primarily represent employees’ exercises of stock options. Cash dividends
paid in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $73 million, $70 million and $70 million.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved share repurchase plans in October
2003, August 2005, December 2005 and January 2006. The plans permitted the Company to repurchase
up to a total of $1 billion ($250 million per plan) of the Company’s common stock. Under these
plans, we repurchased 19 million shares for $958 million during 2006, made no repurchases in 2005
and repurchased 5 million shares for $157 million in 2004. As a result of these repurchases, less
than $1 million of the plans remain available. Repurchased shares will be used to support our
stock-based employee compensation plans and for other general corporate purposes. Stock
repurchases may be made in open market or private transactions. In April 2006, the Board approved
an additional share repurchase plan of up to $500 million of the Company’s common stock.

Working capital primarily includes cash, receivables and inventories, net of drafts and
accounts payable, deferred revenue and the Securities Litigation and other accruals. Our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is
susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and
seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, new customer
build-up requirements and the number and timing of new fee-based arrangements with pharmaceutical
manufacturers. Our working capital has decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in our net
financial inventory, partially offset by improvements in our cash and cash equivalent balances and
additionally, for 2005, due to our Securities Litigation accrual. Improvements in our net
financial inventory primarily reflect a better alignment of our purchases with customer demand for
our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business.

Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed declined as growth in our operating profit was
in excess of the growth in working capital and other investments needed to fund increases in
revenue.

The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of $0.06 per share on its common
stock since the fourth quarter of 1999. A dividend of $0.06 per share was declared by the Board on
January 25, 2006, and was paid on April 3, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business
on March 1, 2006. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in
the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of
the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital
requirements and other factors.

Primarily includes operating lease obligations and purchase
commitments for business acquisitions.

We define a purchase obligation as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is
enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory
purchases, capital commitments and service agreements.

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions (primarily for our
Canadian business) under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of inventory at a discount in the
event these customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial institutions.
Among other limitations, these inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also guaranteed
loans, credit facilities and the payment of leases for some customers and we are a secured lender
for substantially all of these guarantees. Customer guarantees range from one to ten years and
were primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain strategic customers. At March 31,
2006, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer guarantees were
$190 million and $7 million. We consider it unlikely that we would make significant payments under
these guarantees, and accordingly, amounts accrued for these guarantees were nominal.

In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $102 million of standby letters of
credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet the security requirements for statutory
licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive
liability programs.

Credit Resources:

We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash. In addition, we maintain a
short-term borrowings and a receivables sale facility. We have a $1.3 billion five-year, senior
unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in September 2009. Borrowings under this credit
facility bear interest at a fixed base rate, a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offering
Rate (“LIBOR”) rate or a Eurodollar rate. We also have a $1.4 billion accounts receivable sales
facility, which was renewed in June 2005, with terms substantially similar to those previously in
place. This renewed facility is currently scheduled to expire in June 2006. No amounts were
utilized or outstanding under any of these facilities at March 31, 2006.

Our senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s are currently BBB, BBB and Baa3,
and our commercial paper ratings are currently A-2, F-2 and P-3. Our ratings outlook is stable
with all three agencies. Our various borrowing facilities and certain long-term debt instruments
are subject to covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio, which cannot
exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit
facility and $235 million of term debt could be accelerated. At March 31, 2006, this ratio was
14.4% and we were in compliance with all other covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings or the
lack of compliance with our covenants could result in a negative impact on our ability to finance
our operations through our credit facilities, as well as the issuance of additional debt at the
interest rates then currently available.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be
met by existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit sources and other
capital market transactions.

MARKET RISKS

Interest rate risk:

Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas
our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average
interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by 50 bp in 2006 and 2005, interest
expense would not have been materially different from that reported.

As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with
exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $1,082 and $1,335 million. Fair value was
estimated on the basis of quoted market prices, although trading in these debt securities is
limited and may not reflect fair value. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our
performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates
for debt securities with similar terms.

Foreign exchange risk:

We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom,
Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico, which exposes us to
changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through
operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs,
and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also
managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used
to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and
loans. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, an adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange
rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have
exposure to foreign currency risk.

RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS

Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in “Critical
Accounting Policies” appearing within this Financial Review and Financial Note 20, “Related Party
Balances and Transactions,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) replaces SFAS No. 123, “Stock-Based Compensation” issued in
1995. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that the fair value of the grant of employee stock options be
reported as an expense. Historically, we have disclosed in our footnotes the pro forma expense
effect of the grants (see Financial Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
under the caption “Share-Based Payment.”)

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we accelerated the vesting of substantially all of the then
outstanding stock options. As a result of this acceleration, approximately $132 million of pro
forma SFAS No. 123 compensation expense would not be recognized
in earnings in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) post April 1, 2006. Total compensation expense related to unvested stock options not yet
recognized at March 31, 2006 was approximately $11 million, which is expected to be recognized on a
pro rata basis over the next four years.

As a result of the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), in 2007, we expect share-based compensation
charges to approximate $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share, or approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per
diluted share more than the share-based compensation expense recognized in our net income in 2006.
2006 net income includes $0.03 per diluted share of compensation expense associated with restricted
stock whose intrinsic value as of the grant date is being amortized over the vesting period.
Looking beyond 2007 through to 2010, we anticipate the impact of SFAS
No. 123(R) to continue to impact
net income as future awards of share-based compensation are granted and amortized over the expected
vesting period of four years. Our assessments of estimated compensation charges are affected by
our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and
the related tax impact. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our
stock price, employee stock option exercise behaviors, timing, level and types of our grants of
annual share-based awards, and the attainment of performance goals.

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, management’s discussion and analysis includes certain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Some of the
forward-looking statements can be identified by use of forward-looking words such as “believes,”
“expects,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” or
“estimates,” or the negative of these words, or other comparable terminology. The discussion of
financial trends, strategy, plans or intentions may also include forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all
such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed under
“Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” The reader should not consider this list to
be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described herein or in our other public documents.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any
revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following additional factors may affect our future results:

Adverse resolution of pending Securities Litigation regarding the restatement of our historical
financial statements may cause us to incur material losses.

As discussed in Financial Note 18, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the third quarter of 2005, we announced that we
had reached an agreement to settle the action captioned

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities
Litigation

(N.D. Cal. Case No. C-99-20743-RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”). In general, under the
agreement to settle the Consolidated Action, we agreed to pay the settlement class a total of $960
million in cash. The settlement agreement was subject to various conditions, including, but not
limited to, preliminary approval by the Court, notice to the Class, and final approval by the Court
after a hearing. Other than the Consolidated Action, none of the previously reported Securities
Litigation was resolved by the settlement date. As a result, during the third quarter of 2005, we
recorded a pre-tax charge totaling $1.2 billion ($810 million after-tax) for the Securities
Litigation. The charge consisted of $960 million for the Consolidated Action and $240 million for
other Securities Litigation proceedings.

During 2006, we settled many of the other Securities Litigation proceedings and paid $243
million pursuant to those settlements. Based on the payments made in the Consolidated Action and
the other Securities Litigation proceedings, settlements reached in certain of the other Securities
Litigation proceedings and our assessment of the remaining cases, the estimated reserves were
increased by $52 million and $1 million in pre-tax charges during the first and third quarters of
2006 and decreased by an $8 million pre-tax credit during the fourth quarter of 2006, for a total
net pre-tax charge of $45 million for 2006. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, the Securities
Litigation accrual was $1,014 million and $1,214 million. Additionally, on February 24, 2006, the
Honorable Ronald M. Whyte gave final approval to the settlement of
the Consolidated Action, and as a result, we paid approximately $960 million into an escrow account established by
the lead plaintiff in connection with the settlement of the Consolidated Action.

In addition, for the litigation costs not covered under our directors and officers’ liability
insurance policies, we accrue costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. We recorded $27 million, $43 million and $18 million of such
expenses in 2006, 2005 and 2004.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We believe this accrual is adequate to address our remaining potential exposure with respect
to all of the Securities Litigation matters. However, in view of the number of remaining cases, the
uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial amounts
involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters could impact our earnings, either
negatively or positively, in the quarter of their resolution. We do not believe that the
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial position taken as a whole.

Changes in the United States healthcare environment could have a material negative impact on our
revenues and net income.

Our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the
healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the United States. In recent
years, the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. These
changes include increased use of managed care, cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels,
consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors, and the development of
large, sophisticated purchasing groups.

We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of
these changes, such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services, legislation or
regulations governing the privacy of patient information, or the delivery or pricing of
pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry
participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price
they are willing to pay for our products and services.

Changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply
policies or practices, or changes in our customer mix could also significantly reduce our revenues
and net income. Due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare
information technology products and services that we offer, such changes may adversely impact us,
while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services.

There have been increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to limit the product
availability in the supply channel, which consequently impacts the ways in which distributors are
being compensated by manufacturers. We have restructured the majority of our distribution
agreements with the manufacturers to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated
for the services we provide, however, if we fail to negotiate favorable terms in other distribution
agreements, or if we fail to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner,
as we anticipate, such efforts by certain pharmaceutical manufacturers could have an adverse impact
on our profitability.

Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase
over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents. In recent years,
our revenues and gross margins have increased from our generic drug offering programs. An increase
or a decrease in the availability or changes in pricing or reimbursement of these generic drugs
could have a material impact on our net income.

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state boards and
comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the
introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical
distribution system. Certain states, such as Florida, have already adopted laws and regulations
that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other
government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. These laws and regulations
could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical
distribution business, and may negatively impact our operating results.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and
regulations relating to healthcare fraud. The federal government continues to strengthen its
position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting the Medicare, Medicaid
and other government healthcare programs. Furthermore, our relationships with pharmaceutical
manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and
abuse. Many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives
offered by pharmaceutical or medical-surgical suppliers, are vague or indefinite and have not been
interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or
judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties,
including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal and state healthcare programs.

Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”),
the U.S. government recently proposed changes in certain pharmaceutical reimbursement rates. We
may be adversely impacted by these changes or changes that may be proposed in the future under the
Act. We are in the process of developing plans to mitigate any exposures from these changes in
reimbursement rates and the way our customers conduct their business under the Act. However, if we
fail to successfully implement such plans, our business and the results of operations may be
adversely impacted.

Competition may erode our profit

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Pharmaceutical Solutions and
Medical-Surgical Solutions segments face strong competition, both in price and service, from
national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service
merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution and large
payor organizations. In addition, these segments face competition from various other service
providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers (as well as other potential
customers of the segments) which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal
needs, supply management capabilities which are provided by the segments and other competing
service providers. Price, quality of service, and, in some cases, convenience to the customer are
generally the principal competitive elements in these segments. Our Provider Technologies segment
experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other computer services firms,
consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, hardware vendors
and Internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition
varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of
products and services offered. These competitive pressures could result in a decline in our
profit.

Substantial defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of our products by large
customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of
operations and liquidity.

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of
large customers. During the year ended March 31, 2006, sales to our ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 53% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer,
Caremark RX, Inc., represented approximately 11% of our 2006 total consolidated revenues. At March
31, 2006, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers and Caremark RX, Inc. were
approximately 48% and 11% of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit
concentration is significant. Any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from
this or any other large customer could have a significant negative impact on our financial
condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments are dependent upon
sophisticated information systems. The implementation delay, malfunction or failure of these
systems for any extended period of time could adversely affect our business.

We rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process,
analyze and manage data to: facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory
items from numerous distribution centers, receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis,
manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and process payments to
suppliers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if these
systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, or fail for any extended period of time.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We could become subject to liability claims that are not adequately covered by our insurance, and
may have to pay damages and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution and dispensing of
pharmaceuticals, the provision of ancillary services (such as our pharmacy management business) and
the conduct of our medical management businesses (which include disease management programs and our
nurse triage services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and
relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. If customers assert liability claims
against our products, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial
cost to us, divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our
products. We attempt to limit, by contract, our liability to customers; however, the limitations
of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from
liability for damages. We also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not
continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover
one or more large claims against us. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any
future claim. A successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our
insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

The ability of our Provider Technologies business to attract and retain customers due to challenges
in software product integration, and technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues
or increase our expenses.

Our Provider Technologies business delivers enterprise-wide patient care, clinical, financial,
managed care, payor and strategic management software solutions, as well as networking
technologies, electronic commerce, outsourcing and other services to healthcare organizations
throughout the United States and certain foreign countries. Challenges in integrating Provider
Technologies software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and may
reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies,
products or services that are competitive with the products and services offered by our Provider
Technologies business. Such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and
services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure. The success of our Provider
Technologies business will depend, in part, on its ability to be responsive to technological
developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. To remain competitive in the
evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our Provider Technologies business must
develop new products on a timely basis. The failure to develop competitive products and to
introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our Provider Technologies
business to attract and retain customers and thereby significantly reduce our net income.

The loss of third party licenses utilized by our Provider Technologies segment may adversely impact
our operating results.

We license the rights to use certain technologies from third-party vendors to incorporate in
or complement our Provider Technologies segment products and solutions. These licenses are
generally nonexclusive, must be renewed periodically by mutual consent, and may be terminated if we
breach the terms of the license. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product
shipments until we obtain equivalent technology, which could hurt our business. Our competitors
may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology
to compete directly with us. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the
licensed technology in the future, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate, and products may infringe on the rights of
third parties.

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure
and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our
products. There can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our
competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technology. Although we believe that our products do not infringe upon the
proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement
claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement
claims against us in the future. If we were found to be infringing on others’ rights, we may be
required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a
license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing technology. Additionally, we may
find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent,
copyright and trademark rights, and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights
of others. These types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. These litigation expenses,
damage payments, or costs of developing replacement technology could be significant and result in
material losses to us.

System errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen
liabilities.

The software and software systems (“systems”) that we sell or operate are very complex. As
with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first
introduced. For example, our Provider Technologies business systems are intended to provide
information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our systems
have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. Failure of a
client’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of
warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with
the documentation. If such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a
material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of
amounts previously paid, or assert claims for significant damages.

Potential regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of our products as medical devices
could impose increased costs, delay the introduction of new products and negatively impact our
business.

The Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has increasingly focused on the regulation of
computer products and computer-assisted products as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act. If the FDA chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can
impose extensive requirements upon us. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the
FDA could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product
corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing
clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. Any final FDA policy governing computer products,
once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us
from marketing our products.

New and potential federal regulations relating to patient confidentiality and format and data
content standards could depress the demand for our Provider Technologies products and impose
significant product redesign costs and unforeseen liabilities on us.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances
under which those records may be released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of
confidential patient medical record information and will require the users of such information to
implement specified security measures. Regulations currently in place governing electronic health
data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) requires national
standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used
in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health
information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information.
Healthcare organizations were required to comply with the privacy standards by April 2003,
additional transaction regulations by October 2003, and security regulations by April 2005. In
addition, the National Provider Identifier becomes effective May 23, 2007 and a final rule for the
claims attachment regulation is anticipated later this year, which will mandate the implementation
date.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Although Provider Technologies systems have been updated and modified to comply with the
current requirements of HIPAA, evolving HIPAA-related laws or regulations, such as the claims
attachment rule, could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient
information. This could adversely affect demand for our products if they are not re-designed in a
timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations that seek to protect the
privacy and security of patient data or enable our customers to execute new or modified healthcare
transactions. We may need to expend additional capital, research and development and other
resources to modify our products to address evolving data security and privacy issues.

Two Federal bills (H.R. 4157 and S.1952) were introduced in October 2005 proposing the
adoption of the ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS code set to replace the current ICD-9-CM code set with a
recommended two year time frame for implementation. Although it is unclear that either of the
bills will be finalized in 2006, the replacement of ICD-9-CM code set with ICD-10-CM/PCS code sets
will impact Provider Technologies’ products and may require a significant development effort. In
the event that the legislation is not passed this year, there remains a potential that the
ICD-10-CM/PCS code set will be mandated at a future date.

The length of our sales and implementation cycles for our Provider Technologies segment could have
an adverse impact on our future operating results.

Our Provider Technologies segment has long sales and implementation cycles, which could range
from several months to over two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion
of implementation. How and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify
or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. The solutions we
provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer.
Any decision by our customers to delay implementation may adversely affect our revenues.
Furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a
breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction
in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue.

Our inability to perform well under chronic disease or impact condition programs could have an
adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Part of our growth strategy focuses on developing health and care support programs to address
chronic diseases and medical conditions as well as the overall health of all enrollees of a health
plan. Our success in this area, including our ability to recognize revenue, is highly dependent
upon the timely receipt of accurate data from health plan customers and our accurate analysis of
such data. Data acquisition, data quality control and data analysis are complex processes that
carry a risk of untimely, incomplete or inaccurate data from health plan customers or flawed
analysis of such data. If we do not receive timely and accurate data from health plan customers or
our analyses are flawed, or if we fail to execute on new or modified programs, then our operating
results could be adversely impacted.

Reduced capacity in the commercial property insurance market exposes us to potential loss.

In order to provide prompt and complete service to our major Pharmaceutical Solutions
customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. While
we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can
be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. One
or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our
coverage limits could materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable
intangible assets become impaired.

We are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test our goodwill for
impairment at least annually as well as review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our
intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a significant
customer. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated
financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable
intangible assets is determined. This may adversely impact our results of operations.

Our operating results and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations.

We have significant operations based in Canada and other foreign countries, and we have a
large investment in Mexico. In the future we look to continue to grow our foreign operations both
organically and through acquisitions and investments; however, increasing our foreign operations
carries additional risks. Operations outside of the United States may be affected by changes in
trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and
investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for: software; social, political, labor,
or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and difficulties in staffing and managing
foreign operations. Additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations
that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the
applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. Dollar.

Tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings.

We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and
international jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United
States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to
time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax
positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by
these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as international,
tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we
believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws,
regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be
challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions
successfully.

An element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either
expand or complement our business. Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks,
including: the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of
businesses we have acquired, difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the
realization of potential operating synergies, the assimilation and retention of the personnel of
the acquired companies, challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses, and
potential adverse effects on operating results. In addition, we may potentially require additional
financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable. If we are
unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our
business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected.

In addition to the above, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and general
economic and market conditions could affect future results.



McKESSON CORPORATION

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of McKesson Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2006.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit
report on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This audit
report appears on page 53 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

McKESSON CORPORATION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors of McKesson Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended March 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a). We also have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006 based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
March 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES

1.

Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

The consolidated financial statements of McKesson Corporation
(“McKesson,” the “Company,” or “we” and other similar pronouns) include the financial statements of
all majority-owned or controlled companies. Significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless
otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

We conduct our business through three segments. Through our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment,
we are a leading distributor of ethical and proprietary drugs, and health and beauty care products
throughout North America. This segment also manufactures and sells automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems for retail pharmacies, and provides medical management and specialty
pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, patient and other services
for payors, and software, and consulting and outsourcing services to pharmacies. Our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distributes medical-surgical supplies, first-aid products and
equipment, and provides logistics and other services within the United States and Canada. Our
Provider Technologies segment delivers enterprise-wide patient care, clinical, financial, supply
chain, managed care and strategic management software solutions, automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems for hospitals, as well as outsourcing and other services, to healthcare
organizations throughout North America, the United Kingdom and other European countries.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation including the reclassification of certain customer incentives in our
consolidated statements of operations. Customer incentives of $345 million and $246 million for
2005 and 2004 were previously included in cost of goods sold and should have been presented as a
reduction to revenue and therefore have been reclassified to revenue for all periods presented.
These reclassifications had no impact on net income.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

: All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are
included in cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash:

We show amounts paid into an escrow account for future distribution to class
members of our Securities Litigation settlement as restricted cash, and the corresponding liability
in current liabilities under the caption “Securities Litigation.” The liability will be discharged
at such time as the settlement is declared effective by the court. Refer to Financial Note 18,
“Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.”

Marketable
Securities Available for Sale:

We carry our marketable securities
which are available for sale at fair value and the net unrealized gains
and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in marking these securities to market have been
reported within stockholders’ equity.

Inventories:

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. Inventories for the
Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments consist of merchandise held for
resale. For our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories
is determined on the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method and international inventories are stated
using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost of inventories for our Medical-Surgical
Solutions segment is primarily determined on the FIFO method. Provider Technologies segment
inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined either by the specific identification
or the FIFO method. The LIFO method is used to value approximately 85% to 90% of our inventories
at March 31, 2006 and 2005. Total inventories before the LIFO cost adjustment, which approximates
replacement cost, were $7,415 million and $7,682 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005. Vendor
rebates, allowances and chargebacks received from
vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized
when the inventory is sold.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

We state our property, plant and equipment at cost and depreciate them on the straight-line method at
rates designed to distribute the cost of properties over estimated service lives ranging from one
to 30 years.

Capitalized Software Held for Sale:

Development costs for software held for sale, which
primarily pertain to our Provider Technologies segment, are capitalized once a project has
reached the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching
the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life
of approximately three years. We monitor the net realizable value of capitalized software held for
sale to ensure that the investment will be recovered through future sales.

Additional information regarding our capitalized software expenditures is as follows:

Years Ended March 31,

Long-lived Assets:

We assess the recoverability of goodwill on at least an annual basis and
other long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets,
including goodwill, which we expect to hold and use, is based on estimated fair values of the
assets. Estimates of fair values are based on quoted market prices, when available, the results of
valuation techniques utilizing discounted cash flows (using the lowest level of identifiable cash
flows) or fundamental analysis. Long-lived assets to be disposed of, either by sale or
abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use:

We amortize capitalized software held for
internal use over the assets’ estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years. As of March
31, 2006 and 2005, capitalized software held for internal use was $436 million and $410 million,
net of accumulated amortization of $315 million and
$243 million and was included in other assets in
the consolidated balance sheets.

Insurance Programs:

Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain coverage for catastrophic
exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is our policy to
retain a significant portion of certain losses primarily related to workers’ compensation and
comprehensive general, product, and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under these
programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred as
well as for claims incurred but not yet reported. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial
assumptions followed in the insurance industry.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenues for our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions
segments are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, product delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered, there are no further obligations to customers, and collectability is probable.
Revenues for performance-based contracts, whereby revenue is dependent upon successful predefined
outcomes, are recognized by measuring actual results against the expected performance criteria.

Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances and rebates. Sales returns are
recorded when goods are returned to us and are generally not accepted unless the inventory can be
returned to the manufacturer for credit. Commencing in 2005, the Company changed its accounting
policy for customer sales returns to reflect an accrual for estimated customer returns at the time
of sales to the customer in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 48, “Revenue Recognition when Right of Return Exists.” Previously, the Company accounted for
customer sales returns as a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold at the time of the return.
This change in accounting policy did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. Sales returns were approximately $974 million, $853 million and $766 million in 2006,
2005 and 2004. Amounts recorded in revenue and cost of sales under our previous accounting policy
approximated what would have been recorded under SFAS No. 48.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment’s revenues are large volume sales of
pharmaceuticals to a limited number of large self-warehousing customers whereby we order bulk
product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution
facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the
manufacturer) directly to our customers’ warehouses. In addition to these revenues, we also record
revenues associated with direct store deliveries from most of these same customers. Sales to
customer warehouses amounted to $25.5 billion in 2006, $23.8 billion in 2005, and $21.4 billion in
2004. In addition, we also record revenues associated with direct store deliveries from the
manufacturer to our customer for a limited category of products that require special handling,
where we are the primary obligor.

We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-19, “Reporting
Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent,” in determining whether it is appropriate to
record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions
for our revenues. Based on the gross versus net reporting indicators specified in EITF 99-19, our
revenues are recorded gross when we are the primary party obligated in the transaction, take title
to and possession of the inventory, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing
prices, assume the risk of loss for collection from customers as well as delivery or return of the
product, are responsible for fulfillment and other customer service requirements, or the
transactions have several but not all of the these indicators.

Revenues for our Provider Technologies segment are generated primarily by licensing software
systems (consisting of software, hardware and maintenance support), and providing outsourcing and
professional services. Revenue for this segment is recognized as follows:

Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service
agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of delivery or under the
percentage-of-completion method in accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software
Revenue Recognition,” and SOP 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts,” based on the terms and conditions in the contract. Contracts accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on the ratio of labor
costs incurred to date to total estimated labor costs to be incurred. Changes in estimates to
complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to earnings in
the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current
estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.

Hardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue from multi-year software
license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software implementation
fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion contract method.
Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or multi-year agreements and are
recognized ratably over the period covered by the agreements. Remote processing service fees are
recognized monthly as the service is performed. Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the
service is performed.

We also offer our products on an application service provider (“ASP”) basis, making available
our software functionality on a remote hosting basis from our data centers. The data centers
provide system and administrative support as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on
an ASP basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract starting when the
hosting services begin.

This segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain any combination
of software, hardware, implementation or consulting services, or maintenance services. When some
elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value (“VSOE”) exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered elements is
recognized upon delivery of such items. The segment establishes VSOE for hardware and
implementation and consulting services based on the price charged when sold separately, and for
maintenance services, based on renewal rates offered to customers. Revenue for the software
element is recognized under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all
of the undelivered elements in an arrangement. If fair value cannot be established for any
undelivered element, all of the arrangement’s revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last
element or until the fair value of the undelivered element is determinable.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Manufacturer Incentives:

We generally account for fees and other incentives received from our
suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, as a reduction to cost of goods
sold, in accordance with EITF Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor.” We consider these fees to represent product discounts, and as a result,
the fees are recorded as a reduction of product cost and relieved through cost of goods sold upon
the sale of the related inventory.

Supplier Reserves:

We establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to
various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments
otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on our judgment after
carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the
suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us. We
evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates
when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. The ultimate outcome of any
outstanding claim may be different than our estimate.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

We include all costs to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver
inventory to our customers in distribution expenses.

Income Taxes:

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated
at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative currency translation adjustments are
included in accumulated other comprehensive losses in the stockholders’ equity section of the
consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions are
recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material
to our consolidated results of operations in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

Derivative financial instruments are used principally in
the management of our foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded on the balance
sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the
fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive losses and are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged
item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are
recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are
marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in earnings.

Concentrations of Credit Risk:

Trade receivables subject us to a concentration of credit risk
with customers primarily in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. A significant proportion of our
revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers and as a result, our credit
concentration has increased. Accordingly, any defaults in payment by or a reduction in purchases
from these large customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition,
results of operations and liquidity. At March 31, 2006, revenues and accounts receivable from our
ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of consolidated revenues and approximately
48% of accounts receivable. Fiscal 2006 revenues and March 31, 2006 receivables from our largest
customer, Caremark RX, Inc., represented approximately 11% of total consolidated revenues and 11%
of accounts receivable. We have also provided financing arrangements to certain of our customers
within our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, some of which are on a revolving basis. At March 31,
2006, these customer financing arrangements totaled approximately $147 million.

Accounts Receivable Sales:

At March 31, 2006, we had a $1.4 billion revolving receivables
sales facility, which was fully available. The program qualifies for sale treatment under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 140, “Accounting For Transfers and
Servicing Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” Sales are recorded at the
estimated fair values of the receivables sold, reflecting discounts for the time value of money
based on U.S. commercial paper rates and estimated loss provisions. Discounts are recorded in
administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Share-based Payment:

We account for our employee stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” We apply the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure.” Had compensation cost for our employee stock-based compensation been
recognized based on the fair value method, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, net
income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share would have been as follows:

In 2004, we accelerated vesting of substantially all unvested stock options outstanding whose
exercise price was equal to or greater than $28.20, which was substantially all of the total
unvested stock options then outstanding. During the second quarter of 2005, we granted 6 million
stock options, substantially all of which vested on or before March 31, 2005. Similarly, during
the second quarter of 2006, we granted 5 million stock options, substantially all of which vested
on or before March 31, 2006. Prior to 2004, stock options typically vested over a four year
period. These actions were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of
Directors for employee retention purposes and in anticipation of the requirements of SFAS No.
123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” As further discussed in this financial note, under the caption “New
Accounting Pronouncements”, when adopted by us in 2007, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to recognize
the fair value of the equity awards granted to employees as an expense. In addition, this standard
requires that the fair value of the unvested equity awards outstanding as of April 1, 2006 be
recognized at the grant-date fair value as the remaining requisite service is rendered. The pro
forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123 will be prospectively eliminated. Accordingly, SFAS No. 123
compensation expense for the stock option grants that received accelerated vesting in 2004, as well
as the related compensation expense associated with the 2006 and 2005 fully vested stock options,
will not be recognized in our earnings after SFAS No. 123(R) is adopted.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Financial Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided
by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA provides a new deduction for certain qualified
domestic production activities. FSP No. FAS 109-1 was effective immediately and clarified that
such deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction, not as a tax rate reduction, under
SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” no earlier than the year in which the deduction is
reported on the tax return. This provision of the AJCA did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The
AJCA provides a one-time 85% dividends received deduction for certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated under a plan for reinvestment in the United States, providing certain criteria are met.
FSP No. FAS 109-2 was effective immediately and provided accounting and disclosure guidance for
the repatriation provision. FSP No. FAS 109-2 allowed companies additional time to evaluate the
effects of the law on its unremitted earnings for the purpose of applying the “indefinite reversal
criteria” under APB Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas,” and requires
explanatory disclosures from companies that have not yet completed the evaluation. In 2006, we
elected not to repatriate our foreign earnings and as a result, this provision of the AJCA did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs — an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting guidance included in Accounting Research
Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing” related to abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling and spoilage costs. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory
costs incurred during 2007. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 151 on our
consolidated financial statements; however, we do not believe the adoption of this standard will
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which requires the
recognition of cost resulting from transactions in which the Company acquires goods and services by
issuing its shares, share options, or other equity instruments. This standard requires a fair
value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions. This standard
replaces SFAS No. 123, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, the use of the intrinsic
value method as provided under APB Opinion No. 25 will be eliminated. Based on guidance provided
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in April 2005, SFAS No. 123(R) will become
effective for us no later than 2007. The Company intends to adopt this standard using the modified
prospective method of transition. This transition method requires that compensation cost be
recognized for new awards granted and awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after April 1,
2006. This method also requires us to recognize cost for the unvested portion of all awards issued
prior to and outstanding as of April 1, 2006 at the grant-date fair value as the remaining
requisite service is rendered. In addition, under SFAS No. 123(R), we must determine the
appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments and the amortization
method for compensation cost.

In March 2005, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based
Payment”, which provides guidance on the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules
and regulations, as well as on the valuation of share-based payments. SAB No. 107 does not modify
any of the requirements under SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 provides interpretive guidance related
to valuation methods (including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term),
first-time adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in an interim period, the classification of compensation
expense and disclosures subsequent to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we accelerated the vesting of substantially all of the then
outstanding stock options. As a result of this acceleration, approximately $132 million of pro
forma SFAS No. 123 compensation expense would not be recognized
in earnings in accordance with SFAS
No. 123(R) post April 1, 2006. Total compensation expense related to unvested stock options not
yet recognized at March 31, 2006 was approximately $11 million, which is expected to be recognized
on a pro rata basis over the next four years.

As
a result of the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), in 2007, we expect share-based compensation
charges to approximate $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share, or approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per
diluted share more than the share-based compensation expense recognized in our net income in 2006.
2006 net income includes $0.03 per diluted share of compensation expense associated with restricted
stock whose intrinsic value as of the grant date is being amortized over the vesting period.
Looking beyond 2007 through to 2010, we anticipate the impact of SFAS
No. 123(R) to continue to impact
net income as future awards of share-based compensation are granted and amortized over the expected
vesting period of four years. Our assessments of estimated compensation charges are affected by
our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and
the related tax impact. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our
stock price, employee stock option exercise behaviors, timing, level and types of our grants of
annual share-based awards, and the attainment of performance goals.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,” which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not culminate an earning process under
APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions.” SFAS No. 153 requires that that
measurement be based on the recorded amount of the assets relinquished for nonmonetary exchanges
that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the
future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
This standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in 2007. We do not believe
the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.” SFAS No. 155 clarifies certain
issues relating to embedded derivatives and beneficial interests in securitized financial assets,
including permitting fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an
embedded derivative, eliminating the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from
holding certain derivative instruments, and providing clarification that concentrations of credit
risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives. This standard is effective for us
for all financial instruments acquired or issued after 2008. We are currently assessing the impact
of SFAS No. 155; however, we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets -
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.” SFAS No. 156 changes the way entities account for
servicing assets and obligations associated with financial assets acquired or disposed of. SFAS
No. 156 provides some relief for servicers that use derivatives to economically hedge fluctuations
in the fair value of their servicing rights and changes how gains and losses are computed in
certain transfers or securitizations. This standard is effective for us in 2008. We are currently
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 156; however, we do not believe the adoption of this standard will
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions and Investments

We made the following acquisitions and investments:

-

In the second quarter of 2006, we acquired substantially all of
the issued and outstanding stock of D&K Healthcare Resources, Inc.
(“D&K”) of St. Louis, Missouri, for an aggregate cash purchase
price of $479 million, including the assumption of D&K’s debt.
D&K is primarily a wholesale distributor of branded and generic
pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter health and beauty products to
independent and regional pharmacies, primarily in the Midwest.
The results of D&K’s operations have been included in the
consolidated financial statements within our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment since the acquisition date.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the acquisition as of March 31, 2006:

identifiable intangibles of $43 million primarily representing customer lists and not-to-compete
covenants which have an estimated weighted-average useful life of nine years.

-

Also in the second quarter of 2006, we acquired all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Medcon, Ltd. (“Medcon”), an Israeli company, for an
aggregate purchase price of $82 million. Medcon provides web-based cardiac
image and information management services to healthcare providers.
Approximately $66 million of the purchase price was assigned to goodwill, none
of which is deductible for tax purposes and $20 million was assigned to
intangibles which represent technology assets and customer lists which have an
estimated weighted-average useful life of four years. The results of Medcon’s
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements within
our Provider Technologies segment since the acquisition date.

-

In the third quarter of 2005, we invested $33 million
in return for a 79.7% interest in Pahema, S.A. de
C.V. (“Pahema”), a Mexican holding company. Two
additional investors, owners of approximately 30% of
the outstanding shares of Nadro S.A. de C.V.
(“Nadro”) (collectively, “investors”), contributed
$10 million for the remaining interest in Pahema. In
December 2004, Pahema completed a 6.50 Mexican Pesos
per share, or approximately $164 million, tender
offer for approximately 284 million shares (or
approximately 46%) of the outstanding publicly held
shares of the common stock of Nadro. Pahema financed
the tender offer utilizing the cash contributed by
the investors and us, and borrowings totaling 1.375
billion Mexican Pesos, in the form of two notes with
Mexican financial institutions. Prior to the tender
offer, the Company owned approximately 22% of the
outstanding common shares of Nadro. During the first
half of 2006, we merged Pahema into Nadro and the
common stock of Pahema was exchanged for the common
stock of Nadro. After the completion of the merger,
we own approximately 48% of Nadro.

-

In the first quarter of 2005, we acquired all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Moore Medical Corp.
(“MMC”), of New Britain, Connecticut, for an
aggregate cash purchase price of $37 million. MMC is
an Internet-enabled, multi-channel marketer and
distributor of medical-surgical and pharmaceutical
products to non-hospital provider settings.
Approximately $19 million of the purchase price was
assigned to goodwill, none of which was deductible
for tax purposes. The results of MMC’s operations
have been included in the consolidated financial
statements within our Medical-Surgical Solutions
segment since the acquisition date.

During the last three years we also completed a number of other acquisitions and investments
within all three of our operating segments. Purchase prices have been allocated based on estimated
fair values at the date of acquisition and, for certain recent acquisitions, may be subject to change.
Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the
effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or
aggregate basis.

3.

Discontinued Operation

In 2006, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson BioServices Corporation
(“BioServices”), for net proceeds of $63 million. The divestiture resulted in an after-tax gain of
$13 million or $0.04 per diluted share. The results of BioServices’ operations have been presented
as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Financial results for this business were previously included in our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment and were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

4.

Contract

In 2005, our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment entered into an agreement with a third party
vendor to sell the vendor’s proprietary software and services. The terms of the contract required
us to prepay certain royalties. During the third quarter of 2006, we ended marketing and sale of
the software under the contract. As a result of this decision, we recorded a $15 million charge to
cost of sales within our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment in the third quarter of 2006 to
write-off the remaining balance of the prepaid royalties.

Restructuring expenses for 2004, excluding customer settlement reserve reversals,
included $7 million of expenses associated with a number of smaller initiatives, partially offset
by $3 million of credits pertaining to adjustments to prior years’ restructuring reserves. There
were no material offsetting amounts for our 2006 and 2005 restructuring expenses.

Accrued restructuring liabilities are included in other liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. In connection with the D&K acquisition, we recorded $10 million of liabilities
relating to employee severance costs and $30 million for facility exit and contract termination
costs. We anticipate that approximately 300 employees, consisting primarily of distribution,
general and administrative staff, will be terminated as part of this restructuring plan. As of
March 31, 2006, $4 million and $4 million of these liabilities have been paid. The remaining
severance liability of $6 million is anticipated to be paid by the end of 2007, while the remaining
facility exit and contract termination liability of $26 million is anticipated to be paid at
various dates through 2015. Additional restructuring costs are anticipated to be incurred as the
business integration plans are finalized.

In 2005 and 2004, we were still managing a 2001/2000 restructuring plan associated with
customer settlements for the discontinuance of overlapping and nonstrategic products and other
product development projects within our Provider Technologies segment. Customer settlement
reserves were established, reviewed and assessed on a customer and contract specific basis, and
actual settlements for each customer varied significantly depending on the specific mix and number
of products, and each customer’s contract or contracts. In 2004, we had significant customer
settlement activity, including the completion and execution of a number of the more difficult
settlements. As of March 31, 2004, we were substantially complete with our settlements and as a
result, the customer settlement reserve was reduced by $66 million. In 2005, the reserves were
further reduced by $4 million based on additional favorable settlements. There were no significant
offsetting changes in estimates that increase the provision for customer settlements. Total cash
and non-cash settlements of $45 million and $96 million have been incurred since the inception of
this restructuring plan. Non-cash settlements represent write-offs of customer receivables. As of
March 31, 2005, accrued customer settlement reserves were not material to our consolidated
financial statements and the restructuring plan was essentially completed.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that it reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. For 2005, because of our reported net loss, potentially dilutive
securities were excluded from the per share computations due to their antidilutive effect.

The computations for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations
are as follows:

Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures

In February 1997, we issued 5% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures”)
in an aggregate principal amount of $206 million. The Debentures were purchased by McKesson
Financing Trust (the “Trust”) with proceeds from its issuance of four million shares of preferred
securities to the public and 123,720 common securities to us. The Debentures represented the sole
assets of the Trust and bore interest at an annual rate of 5%, payable quarterly. These preferred
securities of the Trust were convertible into our common stock at the holder’s option.

Holders of the preferred securities were entitled to cumulative cash distributions at an
annual rate of 5% of the liquidation amount of $50 per security. Each preferred security was
convertible at the rate of 1.3418 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances. The preferred securities were to be redeemed upon repayment of the Debentures and
were callable by us on or after March 4, 2000, in whole or in part, initially at 103.5% of the
liquidation preference per share, and thereafter at prices declining at 0.5% per annum to 100% of
the liquidation preference on and after March 4, 2007 plus, in each case, accumulated, accrued and
unpaid distributions, if any, to the redemption date.

During the first quarter of 2006, we called for the redemption of the Debentures, which
resulted in the exchange of the preferred securities for 5 million shares of our newly issued
common stock.

Other Financing

We have a $1.3 billion five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in
September 2009. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at a fixed base rate, a
floating rate based on the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) or a Eurodollar rate. We also
have a $1.4 billion accounts receivable sales facility, which was renewed in June 2005, with terms
substantially similar to those previously in place. This renewed facility is currently scheduled
to expire in June 2006. No amounts were utilized or outstanding under any of these facilities at
March 31, 2006 and 2005.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we sold customer lease portfolio receivables for cash proceeds of $60
million, $59 million and $45 million.

The employee stock ownership program (“ESOP”) debt bears interest at rates ranging from 8.6%
fixed rate to approximately 89% of the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) or LIBOR plus 0.4%
and is due in semi-annual and annual installments through 2009.

Our various borrowing facilities and certain long-term debt instruments are subject to
covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio, which cannot exceed 56.5%.
If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $235
million of term debt could be accelerated. At March 31, 2006, this ratio was 14.4% and we were in
compliance with all other covenants.

Aggregate annual payments on long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, for the
years ending March 31, are as follows: $26 million in 2007, $156 million in 2008, $7 million in
2009, $222 million in 2010, nil in 2011 and $580 million thereafter.

12.

Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

At March 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, marketable securities, receivables, drafts and accounts payable, and other liabilities
approximated their estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial
instruments. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt were $991
million and $1,082 million at March 31, 2006 and $1,211 million and $1,335 million at March 31,
2005. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined based on quoted market prices
and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be
realized in the future.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations. We limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and
forward contracts. In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes.
We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

13.

Lease Obligations

We lease facilities and equipment under both capital and operating leases. Net assets held
under capital leases included in property, plant and equipment were $3 million at both March 31,
2006 and 2005. Rental expense under operating leases was $113 million, $112 million and $108
million in 2006, 2005 and 2004. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease, taking into account, when applicable, lessor incentives for tenant improvements,
periods where no rent payment is required and escalations in rent payments over the term of the
lease. Deferred rent is recognized for the difference between the rent expense recognized on a
straight-line basis and the payments made per the terms of the lease. Most real property leases
contain renewal options and provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and operating expenses in
excess of base period amounts.

14.  Pension Benefits

We maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and defined
contribution plans for eligible employees.

Defined Pension Benefit Plans

Eligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company prior to December 31, 1996 are
covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan. In 1997, we amended this plan
to freeze all plan benefits based on each employee’s plan compensation and creditable service
accrued to that date. The Company has made no annual contributions since this plan was frozen. The
benefits for this defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at date
of retirement, years of service and employees’ pay during the five years prior to retirement. We
also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible Canadian and United Kingdom employees as well
as nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plans for certain U.S. executives, which are
non-funded. The measurement date for all of our pension plans is December 31.

The net periodic expense for our pension plans is as follows:

The projected unit credit method is utilized for measuring net periodic pension expense over

over the remaining future service periods.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Additional minimum liabilities were established to increase accrued benefit cost for our
plans, totaling $48 million and $44 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005. The additional minimum
liabilities were partially offset by intangible assets of $14 million and $15 million at March 31,
2006 and 2005, and charged to other comprehensive income (loss) included in the consolidated
stockholders’ equity, net of tax.

Projected benefit obligations relating to our unfunded U.S. plans were $87 million and $78
million at March 31, 2006 and 2005. Pension costs are funded based on the recommendations of
independent actuaries. We expect contributions for our pension plans in 2007 to be approximately
$22 million.

Expected benefit payments for our pension plans are as follows:

tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may be adjusted to achieve our overall
investment objective.

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Other Defined Benefit Plans

Under various U.S. bargaining unit labor contracts, we make payments into multi-employer
pension plans established for union employees. We are liable for a proportionate part of the
plans’ unfunded vested benefits liabilities upon our withdrawal from the plan, however information
regarding the relative position of each employer with respect to the actuarial present value of
accumulated benefits and net assets available for benefits is not available. Contributions to the
plans and amounts accrued were not material for the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have a contributory profit sharing investment plan (“PSIP”) for U.S. employees not covered
by collective bargaining arrangements. Eligible employees may contribute up to 20% of their
compensation to an individual retirement savings account. Prior to 2006, the Company made matching
contributions equal to or greater than 50% of employee contributions, not to exceed 3% of employee
compensation. Effective April 1, 2005, the Company makes matching contributions in an amount equal
to 100% of the employee’s first 3% of pay deferred, and 50% of the employee’s deferral for the next
2% of pay deferred. The Company provides for the PSIP contributions primarily with its common
shares through its leveraged ESOP or cash payments.

The ESOP has purchased an aggregate of 24 million shares of the Company’s common stock since
its inception. These purchases were financed by 10 to 20-year loans from or guaranteed by us. The
ESOP’s outstanding borrowings are reported as long-term debt of the Company and the related
receivables from the ESOP are shown as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. The loans are repaid
by the ESOP from interest earnings on cash balances and common dividends on shares not yet
allocated to participants, common dividends on certain allocated shares and Company cash
contributions. The ESOP loan maturities and rates are identical to the terms of related Company
borrowings. Stock is made available from the ESOP based on debt service payments on ESOP
borrowings.

Contribution expense for the PSIP in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was primarily ESOP related.
After-tax ESOP expense and other contribution expense, including interest expense on ESOP debt, was
$7 million, $9 million and $8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Approximately 1 million, 1 million
and 2 million shares of common stock were allocated to plan participants in 2006, 2005 and 2004.
Through March 31, 2006, 23 million common shares have been allocated to plan participants,
resulting in a balance of 2 million common shares in the ESOP, which have not yet been allocated to
plan participants.

15. Other Postretirement Benefits

We maintain a number of postretirement benefits, consisting of healthcare and life insurance
benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees. Eligible employees consist of those who retired
before March 31, 1999 and those who retire after March 31, 1999, but were an active employee as of
that date, after meeting other age-related criteria. We also provide postretirement benefits for
certain U.S. executives. The measurement date for our postretirement plans is December 31.

As described in Note 1, we adopted the provisions of FSP No. FAS 109-2 in the second quarter
of 2005. The expected Medicare subsidy had the effect of reducing the Company’s accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $19 million. This reduction is recognized as
an actuarial gain and amortized over three years. The expected subsidy also resulted in a nominal
reduction in interest cost in 2005. As required by the FSP, the Company recognized total
reductions in postretirement benefit expense of $7 million in 2005.

In March 2006, we made a $960 million payment into an escrow account relating to the
Securities Litigation as described in more detail in Financial Note 18 “Other Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities.” This payment will be deducted in our 2006 income tax returns and as a
result, our current tax expense decreased and our deferred tax expense increased in 2006 primarily
reflecting the utilization of the deferred tax assets associated with the Securities Litigation.
In 2006, we recorded a $14 million income tax expense which primarily relates to a basis adjustment
in an investment and adjustments with various taxing authorities.

In 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of $390 million for the Securities Litigation which
is described in more detail in Financial Note 18. We believe the settlement of the consolidated
securities class action and the ultimate resolution of the lawsuits brought independently by other
shareholders will be tax deductible. However, the tax attributes of the litigation are complex and
the Company expects challenges from the taxing authorities, and accordingly such deductions will
not be finalized until all the lawsuits are concluded and an examination of the Company’s tax
returns is completed. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2005, we provided a reserve of $85 million for
future resolution of these uncertain tax matters. This reserve was increased to $88 million in
2006. While we believe the tax reserve is adequate, the ultimate resolution of these tax matters
may exceed or be below the reserve.

In 2005, we recorded a $10 million income tax benefit arising primarily from settlements and
adjustments with various taxing authorities and a $3 million income tax benefit primarily due to a
reduction of a valuation allowance related to state income tax net operating loss carryforwards.
We believe that the income tax benefit from a portion of these state net operating loss
carryforwards will now be realized.

In 2004, we recorded a $23 million income tax benefit relating to favorable tax settlements
and adjustments with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and with various other taxing authorities.
A large portion of this benefit, which was not previously recognized by the Company, resulted from
the filing of amended tax returns by our subsidiary, McKesson Information Solutions LLC (formerly
known as HBO & Company (“HBOC”)) for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in determining the estimated worldwide provision for income taxes. During the
ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on
estimates of whether additional amounts will be due. As of March 31, 2006, approximately $274
million has been accrued for such matters, including our tax reserves for the Securities
Litigation. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the
amounts that

were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period
in which such determination is made.

Foreign pre-tax earnings were $244 million, $235 million and $200 million in 2006, 2005 and
2004. At March 31, 2006, undistributed earnings of our foreign operations totaling $808 million
were considered to be permanently reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been recognized for
the remittance of such earnings to the U.S. since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in
the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an
indefinite period of time, or to repatriate such earnings when it is tax efficient to do so. The
determination of the amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable since the
computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a decision to repatriate
the earnings is made.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

We have income tax net operating loss carryforwards related to our U.K. operations of
approximately $111 million, which have an indefinite life.

We have federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $118 million and $660
million which will expire at various dates from 2007 through 2026. We believe that it is more
likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will now be
realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $3 million on the
deferred tax assets relating to these state net operating loss carryforwards.

We also have income tax credit carryforwards of $159 million, which are primarily alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards that have an indefinite life.

In 2005, we have reversed a portion of the valuation allowance related to these state net
operating loss carryforwards, of which $10 million of the tax benefit, net of impairment, was
credited to equity.

17. Financial Guarantees and Warranties

Financial Guarantees

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions under which we have
guaranteed the repurchase of inventory (primarily for our Canadian business) at a discount in the
event these customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial institutions.
Among other requirements, these inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also
guaranteed loans, credit facilities and the payment of leases for some customers; and we are a
secured lender for substantially all of these guarantees. Customer guarantees range from one to
ten years and were primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain strategic customers. At
March 31, 2006, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer
guarantees were $190 million and $7 million of which a nominal amount had been accrued.

In 2004, a Pharmaceutical Solutions customer filed for bankruptcy. Accordingly, we reviewed
all amounts owed to us from this customer as well as financial guarantees provided to third parties
in favor of this customer, and as a result, we increased our provision for doubtful accounts by $30
million. On April 21, 2004, we converted a $40 million credit facility guarantee in favor of this
customer to a note receivable due from this customer. This secured note bears interest and is
repayable in 2007. In conjunction with this modification, an inventory repurchase guarantee in
favor of this customer for approximately $12 million was also terminated. The amount due under the
note receivable from this customer was approximately $31 million at March 31, 2006.

At March 31, 2006, we had commitments of $5 million, primarily consisting of the purchase of
services from our equity-held investments, for which no amounts had been accrued.

The expirations of the above noted financial guarantees and commitments are as follows: $122
million, $22 million, $2 million, nil and $1 million from 2007 through 2011, and $55 million
thereafter.

In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $102 million of standby letters of
credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet the security requirements for statutory
licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive
liability programs.

Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying
customers against liabilities if our software products infringe on a third party’s intellectual
property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such
indemnification agreements and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine
indemnification agreements (such as retention of previously existing environmental, tax and
employee liabilities) whose terms vary in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where
appropriate, obligations for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the
amounts of these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum
amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as
liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have historically not made significant payments as a
result of these indemnification provisions.

Warranties

In the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and indemnification protection
for our products and services. For example, we provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and
medical-surgical products we distribute are in compliance with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
other applicable laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our suppliers,
which customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In addition, we have indemnity
obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been provided to us from our
suppliers, either through express agreement or by operation of law.

We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and automation products we
sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring the product into compliance with previously
agreed upon specifications. For software products, this may result in additional project costs,
which are reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for
software installation services within these contracts. In addition, most of our customers who
purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance agreements. Revenue
from these maintenance agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period
and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when claims become estimable.
Accrued warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.

18. Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

I. Accounting Litigation

Following the announcements by McKesson in April, May and July of 1999 that McKesson had
determined that certain software sales transactions in its Information Solutions segment, formerly
HBO & Company and now known as McKesson Information Solutions LLC, were improperly recorded as
revenue and reversed, as of March 31, 2006, ninety-two lawsuits were filed against McKesson, HBOC,
certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and other defendants,
including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. (“Bear Stearns”) and Arthur Andersen LLP (“Andersen”). On
January 12, 2005, we announced that we reached an agreement to settle the previously-reported
action in the Northern District of California captioned:

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities
Litigation,

(No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”). In general, under the
agreement to settle the Consolidated Action, we agreed to pay the settlement class a total of $960
million in cash. The settlement agreement was subject to various conditions, including, but not
limited to, preliminary approval by the court, notice to the Class, and final approval by the court
after a hearing. Other than the Consolidated Action, none of the previously reported Securities
Litigation was resolved by the settlement date. As a result, during the third quarter of 2005, we
recorded a $1,200 million pre-tax ($810 million after-tax) charge with respect to the Company’s
Securities Litigation. The charge consisted of $960 million for the Consolidated Action and $240
million for other Securities Litigation proceedings.

During 2006, we settled many of the other Securities Litigation proceedings and paid $243
million pursuant to those settlements. Based on the payments made in the Consolidated Action and
the other Securities Litigation proceedings, settlements reached in certain of the other Securities
Litigation proceedings and our assessment of the remaining cases, the estimated reserves were
increased by $52 million and $1 million in pre-tax charges during the first and third quarters of
2006 and decreased by an $8 million pre-tax credit during the fourth quarter of 2006, for a total
net pre-tax charge of $45 million for 2006. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, the Securities
Litigation accrual was $1,014 million and $1,214 million. Additionally, on February 24, 2006, the
court gave final approval to the settlement of the Consolidated Action, and as a result, we paid
approximately $960 million into an escrow account established by the lead plaintiff in connection
with the settlement of the Consolidated Action.

We believe this accrual is adequate to address our remaining
potential exposure with respect to all of the Securities Litigation matters. However, in view of the number
of remaining cases, the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, and the
substantial amounts involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters could impact
our earnings, either negatively or positively, in the quarter of their resolution. We do not
believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, liquidity or financial position taken as a whole.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Although most of those cases have been resolved as reported here and previously, certain
matters remain pending as more fully described below:

Federal Actions

On February 24, 2006, the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte signed a Final Judgment and Order of
Dismissal (the “Judgment”), in which the Court gave its final approval to the settlement of the
Consolidated Action and dismissed on the merits and with prejudice all claims asserted in the
Consolidated Action against the Company, HBOC, and Defendants’ Released Persons (as that term is
defined in the Judgment). On March 23, 2006, Defendant Bear, Stearns filed an appeal of the
Judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeal by Bear Stearns
challenges certain provisions of the settlement that restrict Bear Stearns’ ability to bring
certain claims in the future against the Company, HBOC and certain other persons released in the
settlement. The outcome of the Bear Stearns appeal will not affect the Company’s right and ability
to enjoy the other benefits of the settlement, including the releases of the Company, HBOC and the
Defendants’ Released Persons (as that term is defined in the Stipulation of Settlement) by the
members of the settlement class.

On March 30, 2006, the Company paid approximately $960 million into an escrow account
established in connection with the settlement of the Consolidated Action in full satisfaction of
its payment obligations under the Judgment and the Stipulation of Settlement. Any distribution of
the funds deposited into the escrow account to class members is subject to prior court approval.
We show amounts paid into an escrow account for future distribution to class members of our
Securities Litigation settlement as restricted cash, and the corresponding liability in current
liabilities under the caption “Securities Litigation.” The liability will be discharged at such
time as the settlement is declared effective by the Court.

During December 2005 and January 2006, the Company agreed to settle the previously-reported
actions pending in Federal Court in the Northern District of California captioned:

Jacobs v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (No. C-99-21192 RMW),

Jacobs v. HBO & Company

, (No. C-00-20974 RMW),

Bea v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (No. C-00-20072 RMW),

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (No.
CV 00-0188),

Pacha, et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

, (No. C01-20713 PVT), and

Hess v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No. C-20003862). The previously-reported action captioned

Cater
v. McKesson Corporation et al.

, (No. C-00-20327-RMW) remains the only individual action pending in
Federal Court.

On September 9, 2005, Judge Whyte granted final approval to our agreement to settle all claims
brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) on behalf of a class of
former participants in the HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan in the previously reported
action captioned

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. ERISA Litigation

, (No. C-00-20030 RMW) (the “ERISA
Action”). In March 2006, we reached an agreement to settle that portion of the ERISA Action that
purports to assert claims on behalf of a class of former participants in the McKesson
Profit-Sharing Investment Plan for $19 million, plus certain accrued interest, minus certain costs
and expenses such as plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The settlement remains subject to various
contingencies, including notice to the class and approval by the Court, and, if finalized, will
accomplish the release of all remaining claims against all defendants in the ERISA Action.

On August 11, 2005, the Company and HBOC filed a complaint against Andersen and former
Andersen partner Robert A. Putnam (“Putnam”) in San Francisco Superior Court captioned

McKesson
Corporation et al. v Andersen et al.

, (No. 05-443987), which Putnam subsequently removed to the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Upon removal, the case was
assigned to Judge Whyte and given N.D. Cal. case No. 05-04020 RMW. In its complaint, as amended on
March 28, 2006, McKesson asserts claims against Andersen for negligent misrepresentation, breach of
contract, equitable indemnity or declaratory relief, and contribution, and HBOC asserts claims
against Andersen for breach of contract, professional negligence, equitable indemnity or
declaratory relief, and contribution. McKesson and HBOC also assert claims against Putnam for
equitable indemnity or declaratory relief, and contribution, in connection with Andersen’s audits
and reviews of HBOC’s financial results during 1996-1999. The complaint seeks unspecified damages,
various forms of equitable and declaratory relief, costs of suit and attorneys’ fees. On March 16,
2006, Andersen filed an action against the Company and HBOC in federal court in San Jose captioned

Andersen v. McKesson Corporation et al.

, (No. C-06-02035-JW). In its complaint, Andersen asserts
claims against McKesson and HBOC for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach
of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, equitable indemnity and declaratory relief, in
connection with Andersen’s prior audits and reviews of HBOC’s financial results. The complaint
seeks unspecified damages, including punitive damages in an unspecified amount, declaratory relief,
and costs of suit.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

State Actions

Twenty-four actions were also filed in various state courts in California, Colorado, Delaware,
Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State
Actions generally allege misconduct by McKesson or HBOC (and others) in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements. Of these actions, only
three Georgia actions have not been resolved.

The actions pending in California Superior Court have all been settled.

Utah State Retirement
Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 311269) and

Minnesota State Board of Investment v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No. 311747) were settled in July 2005.

The State of Oregon by
and through the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No.
307619) was settled in August 2005.

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al., v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. CGC-02-405792) was settled in October 2005, and

Yurick v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Case No. 303857) was settled in November 2005.

On December 16, 2005, the Company and certain of its present and former directors and officers
filed a stipulation in the Delaware Court of Chancery setting out the terms of a settlement of the
previously-reported derivative action captioned

Saito et al. v. McCall et al.

, (Del Ch. C.A. No.
17132-NC). Under the settlement, the Company’s insurance companies were required to pay $30
million, and the Company agreed to release its claims against certain present or former directors
and officers of the Company and HBOC, among other terms. The settlement also required dismissal of
two other previously reported derivative actions, one pending in federal court in California,

Cohen
v. McCall et al.

, (No. 99-20916-RMW) and one pending in state court in California,

Mitchell v.
McCall, et al.

, (S.F. Supr. No. 304415). The Delaware Court approved the settlement on February
24, 2006, and the $30 million settlement amount has been received from the insurers by McKesson,
which in turn has paid $6 million of that amount over to the Saito plaintiffs’ attorneys in court
approved attorneys’ fees and costs.

Two previously-reported actions pending in Georgia state courts,

Suffolk Partners Limited
Partnership et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Georgia State Court, Fulton County, Case No.
00VS010469A) and

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

, (Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, Case No. 00 VS 010801) have been settled. Three Georgia actions remain pending in state
courts:

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v. McKesson, Inc. et al.

, (Georgia Superior Court, Fulton
County, Case No. 2002-CV-48407);

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson, Inc. et al.

(Georgia
Superior Court, Fulton County, Case No. 2002-CV-48612); and

James Gilbert v. McKesson Corporation,
et al.

, (Georgia State Court, Fulton County, Case No. 02VS032502C). The allegations in these
actions are substantially similar to those in the Consolidated Action. The Company and HBOC have
answered the complaints in each of these actions, generally denying the allegations and any
liability to plaintiffs. The

Green

and

Hall Family Investments

actions were voluntarily dismissed
by plaintiffs on April 26, 2006 in the Georgia Superior Court and have been refiled in Georgia
State Court, Fulton County

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v. McKesson Corporation, et al.

(Georgia
State Court, Fulton County, Case No. 06-VS-096767-D) and

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson
Corporation, et al.

(Georgia State Court, Fulton County, Case No. 06-VS-096763-F). Plaintiffs
there allege claims of fraud and deceit; additionally, plaintiff Green seeks indemnification in
connection with the ERISA Action and for other unspecified indemnification. The

Gilbert

action
asserts claims for fraud, deceit and negligent misrepresentation. The

Gilbert

action is in
discovery, and no trial date has been set in that matter.

In December of 2005, Bear Stearns filed a complaint captioned,

Bear Stearns & Co., Inc v.
McKesson Corporation

, (Case No. 604304/5), against the Company in the trial court for the State and
County of New York. Bear Stearns alleges that the Company’s entry into the settlement of the
Consolidated Action, without providing for a full release of Bear Stearns in that settlement, was a
breach of the engagement letter under which Bear Stearns advised the Company in connection with its
acquisition of HBOC. Bear Stearns’ complaint seeks monetary and other relief, including an order
enjoining the Company from performing under the settlement agreement. This same objection was made
by Bear Stearns in its opposition to preliminary and final approvals of the class action
settlement. The objection was rejected by Judge Whyte as grounds for denying approval of the
settlement in his September 28, 2005 order granting preliminary approval and in his February 24,
2006 order granting final approval.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

II.

Other Litigation and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject
to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for product liability and other
damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out
of the normal conduct of our business. These include:

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., is one of multiple defendants in approximately
10 cases in which plaintiffs claim they were injured due to exposure, over many years, to latex
proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of
distributors, including McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its
suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers.

The Company is a defendant in approximately 500 California cases alleging that the plaintiffs
were injured by Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory drug manufactured by Merck & Company (“Merck”). The
cases typically assert causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty and
false advertising for improper design, testing, manufacturing, and warnings relating to the
manufacture and distribution of Vioxx. None of the cases involving the Company is scheduled for
trial. The Company has tendered each of these cases to Merck and has reached an agreement with
Merck to defend and indemnify the Company.

The Company is a defendant in approximately 42 cases alleging that the plaintiffs were injured
because they took the drugs known as fen-phen, the term commonly used to describe the weight-loss
combination of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with phentermine. The Company has been named as a
defendant along with several other defendants in 41 cases and has accepted the tender of one of its
customers named as a defendant in one additional case. The cases are pending in state courts in
California and Mississippi and in state and federal courts in Florida and New York, and typically
assert causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, false advertising and
unfair business practices for improper design, testing, manufacturing and warnings relating to the
distribution and/or prescription of fen-phen. The Company has tendered each of these cases to its
suppliers and has reached an agreement with its major supplier to defend and indemnify the Company
and its customers.

We, through our former McKesson Chemical Company division, are named in approximately 375
cases involving the alleged distribution of asbestos. These cases typically involve either single
or multiple plaintiffs claiming personal injuries and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages
as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement
signed at the time of the 1986 sale of McKesson Chemical Company to what is now called Univar USA
Inc. (“Univar”), we have tendered each of these actions to Univar. Univar has raised questions
concerning the extent of its obligations under the indemnification agreement, and while Univar
continues to defend us in many of these cases, it has been rejecting our tenders of new cases since
February 2005. We believe Univar remains obligated for all tendered cases under the terms of the
indemnification agreement; however we are beginning to incur defense costs in connection with these
more recently-served actions. We also believe that a portion of the claims against us will be
covered by insurance, and we are pursuing the available coverage.

On May 3, 2004, judgment was entered against the Company and one of its employees in the
action

Roby v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Superior Court of Yolo County, California, Case No.
CV01-573). Former employee Charlene Roby (“Roby”) brought claims for wrongful termination, disability
discrimination and disability-based harassment against the Company and a claim for disability-based
harassment against her former supervisor. The jury awarded Roby
compensatory damages against the Company and against her supervisor
in the amount of $4 million, and punitive damages
in the amount of $15 million against the Company and a nominal amount against her supervisor.
Following post-trial motions, the trial court reduced the amount of compensatory damages against
the Company to $3 million; the punitive damages awarded against both defendants and the
compensatory damages awarded against the individual employee defendant were not reduced. On
October 18, 2004, the trial court awarded Roby her attorney’s fees. The Company filed a Notice of
Appeal, seeking reduction or reversal of the compensatory and punitive damage awards and the award
of attorney’s fees. The briefing on that appeal is complete, but no hearing date for argument has
yet been set.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

On February 5, 2004, a class action complaint was filed by an individual, Gary Dutton, in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Company’s subsidiary,
D&K and D&K’s former Chief Executive, Operating and Financial Officers alleging breach of fiduciary
duties and violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5,

Gary Dutton v. D&K Healthcare Resources, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 4-04-CV-00147-SNL). The
Commercial Workers Union, Local 655, AFL-CIO, Food Employees Joint Pension Plan (“Lead Plaintiff”)
in that action seeks to represent a class consisting of purchasers of D&K’s publicly traded common
stock during the period from August 10, 2000 to September 16, 2002 and seeking compensatory
damages, costs, fees and expenses of suit. On November 15, 2004, Lead Plaintiff filed an Amended
Complaint naming additional defendants, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”) and a non-officer
former employee of D&K. The class generally alleges that D&K failed to timely disclose that its
sales of branded drugs during most of the class period were heavily dependent on its ability to
purchase drugs from vendor BMS at discounted prices and in volume, and that defendants knew, but
did not disclose, that the effect of losing its attractive purchase terms from BMS would be a
material reduction in sales volume and profit. On February 4, 2005, all defendants filed motions
to dismiss the Amended Complaint. Oral argument on the motions was conducted on May 20, 2005. The
Court has not yet ruled on these motions.

On June 2, 2005, a civil class action complaint was filed against the Company in the United
States District Court, District of Massachusetts,

New England Carpenters Health Benefits Fund et
al., v. First DataBank, Inc. and McKesson Corporation

, (Civil Action No.05-11148), alleging that
commencing in late 2001 and early 2002 the Company and co-defendant First DataBank agreed to take
actions to increase the “Average Wholesale Price” of certain branded drugs, which alleged conduct
resulted in higher drug reimbursement payments by plaintiffs and others similarly situated. The
complaint purports to state claims based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, violations of the California Business and Professions Code and California
Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and for negligent misrepresentation. The plaintiffs seek injunctive
relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company has
responded to the complaint and the matter is in the early stages of discovery. No trial date has
been set.

The Company, along with two other national pharmaceutical distributors and multiple
pharmaceutical manufacturers, has been named as a defendant in an amended complaint filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California in a previously pending class
action brought by The County of Santa Clara, California, on behalf of itself and others similarly
situated,

The County of Santa Clara vs. AmerisourceBergen Corporation et al.

(C-05-03740-WHA). The
plaintiff alleges that it was overcharged for certain drugs under a federal program providing
discounted costs for prescription drugs to eligible parties under the Public Health Service Act of
1992, Section 340B. The action seeks an accounting and purports to state claims under the
California Business and Professions Code, Section 17200 et seq., the California False Claims Act
and for unjust enrichment. This action was dismissed “without prejudice” on April 19, 2006.

The health care industry is highly regulated, and government agencies continue to increase
their scrutiny over certain practices affecting government programs. From time to time, the
Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies. The
Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely
manner. These responses sometimes require considerable time and effort, and can result in
considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Examples of such requests and subpoenas that
have been previously reported include the following: (1) we have received a subpoena from the U.S.
Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts seeking documents relating to the Company’s business
relationship with a long-term care pharmacy organization and we are in the process of responding to
this subpoena; (2) we have responded to a request from the Federal Trade Commission for certain
documents as part of a non-public investigation to determine whether the Company may have engaged
in anti-competitive practices with other wholesale pharmaceutical distributors in order to limit
competition for provider customers seeking distribution services; (3) we have received a Civil
Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Attorney General’s Office of the State of Tennessee
apparently in connection with an investigation into possible violations of the Tennessee Medicaid
False Claims Act in connection with repackaged pharmaceuticals and we are in the process of
responding to this subpoena; (4) we have responded to a subpoena from the office of the Attorney
General of the State of New York (“NYAG”) requesting documents and other information concerning our
participation in the secondary or “alternative source” market for pharmaceutical products. We have
also recently received a subpoena from the NYAG relating to the pricing on certain drugs, including
the First DataBank average wholesale and average benchmark prices for such drugs, and we intend to
respond to this subpoena and otherwise cooperate with the NYAG. Because these investigations are
not concluded, we cannot predict the outcome or impact, if any, of these proceedings on our
business.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses, which were fully
divested by 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations. We have received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to
investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged
to exist at six sites where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations and we,
by administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain actions at those sites, including
soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, we are one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United States Environmental
Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages (“NRD”) associated with
one of these six sites. Although the Company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot
be determined at this time, we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) group in the funding of an NRD assessment, the costs of which are reflected in the
aggregate estimates set forth below.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with outside
environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of reasonably possible remediation
costs for these six sites is $10 million, net of approximately $2 million that third parties have
agreed to pay in settlement or we expect, based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions
which are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties. The $10 million is expected to be paid out
between April 2006 and March of 2035. Our estimated liability for these environmental matters has
been accrued in the accompanying balance sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law or its state law
equivalent) for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of
hazardous substances at 28 sites. With respect to each of these sites, numerous other PRPs have
similarly been designated and, while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and
several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with
other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 28 sites is approximately $2 million. The aggregate
settlements and costs paid by us in Superfund matters to date have not been significant. The
accompanying consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors
as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs; the complexity and evolving
nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, the timing, varying costs
and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs are recoverable from
insurance or other parties.

While it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome or the duration of
any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this section II, “Other
Litigation and Claims”, we believe based on current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that
such litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

19. Stockholders’ Equity

Each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock is permitted one vote on proposals
presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the
Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”).

The Board approved share repurchase plans in October 2003, August 2005, December 2005 and
January 2006. The plans permitted the Company to repurchase up to a total of $1 billion ($250
million per plan) of the Company’s common stock. Under these plans, we repurchased 19 million
shares for $958 million during 2006, made no repurchases in 2005 and repurchased 5 million shares
for $157 million in 2004. As a result of these repurchases, less than $1 million of the plans
remain available. Repurchased shares will be used to support our stock-based employee compensation
plans and for other general corporate purposes. Stock repurchases may be made in open market or
private transactions. In April 2006, the Board approved an additional share repurchase plan of up
to $500 million of the Company’s common stock.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In 2005, the Board renewed the common stock rights plan. Under the renewal of the plan,
effective October 22, 2004, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one right (a “Right”) for
each outstanding share of Company common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase, upon
the occurrence of certain triggering events, a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Triggering events include, without limitation, the
acquisition by another entity of 15% or more of the Company’s common stock without the prior
approval of the Board. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects that will cause substantial
dilution to the ownership interest of a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on
terms not approved by the Board. The new Rights will expire in 2014, unless the date is extended
or the Rights are redeemed or exchanged earlier by the Board.

In
2005, our stockholders approved a new stock plan (the “2005
Stock Plan”) which allows for the grant of options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performances shares and other share-based awards to employees, officers and
directors of the Company. The 2005 Stock Plan replaced several other
plans (the “Legacy Plans”) and the remaining 11 million shares available for issuance under the Legacy Plans were cancelled, although awards under those plans remain outstanding.
Under the 2005 Stock Plan, 13 million new shares were authorized
for issuance, and as of March 31, 2006, 8 million shares remain available for grant. As a result of acquisitions, we also have 14 other option plans
under which no further awards have been made since the date of acquisition.

The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) under which 11 million shares
have been authorized for issuance. Eligible employees may purchase a limited number of shares of
the Company’s common stock at a discount of up to 15% of the market value at certain plan-defined
dates. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, 1 million, 2 million and 1 million shares were issued under the
ESPP. At March 31, 2006, 2 million shares were available for issuance under the ESPP.

20. Related Party Balances and Transactions

Notes receivable outstanding from certain of our current and former officers and senior
managers totaled $45 million at both March 31, 2006 and 2005. These notes related to purchases of
common stock under our various employee stock purchase plans. The notes bear interest at rates
ranging from 4.7% to 7.1% and were due at various dates through February 2004. Interest income on
these notes is recognized only to the extent that cash is received. These notes, which are
included in other capital in the consolidated balance sheets, were issued for amounts equal to the
market value of the stock on the date of the purchase and are full recourse to the borrower. At
March 31, 2006, the value of the underlying stock collateral was $33 million. The collectability
of these notes is evaluated on an ongoing basis. As a result, in 2004, we recorded a $21 million
charge for notes from the former officers and employees. In 2006 and 2005, we reversed
approximately $9 million and $6 million of this reserve based on an increase in price of the
underlying stock collateral. Other receivable balances held with related parties, consisting of
loans made to certain officers and senior managers and an equity-held investment, at March 31, 2006
and 2005 amounted to $1 million and $2 million.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004 we incurred approximately $7 to $8 million annually of rental expense
from an equity-held investment. In addition, in 2006, 2005 and 2004 we purchased $3 million of
services per year from an equity-held investment. At March 31, 2006, we had a $4 million loan
receivable from an equity held investment. The loan bears interest at 7.9% and is repayable in
2007.

21. Segments of Business

Our segments include Pharmaceutical Solutions, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Provider
Technologies. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on operating profit
before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued operations. Our Corporate
segment includes expenses associated with Corporate functions and projects, certain employee
benefits, and the results of certain joint venture investments. Corporate expenses are allocated
to the operating segments to the extent that these items can be directly attributable to the
segment.
