Business Segments

We operate in two segments.  The McKesson Distribution Solutions segment distributes ethical and proprietary drugs and equipment and health and beauty care products throughout North America and internationally.  This segment includes our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business which reflects the results of operations from our acquisition of Celesio AG (“Celesio”) in February 2014.  This segment  provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to oncology and other specialty practices operating in the community setting.  This segment also provides medical-surgical supply distribution, equipment, logistics and other services to healthcare providers through a network of distribution centers within the U.S.  In addition, this segment sells financial, operational and clinical solutions for pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing and other services.  In September 2013, we sold our 49% interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”), a pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico.  Prior to the sale, financial results for Nadro were included in this segment.

The McKesson Technology Solutions segment includes McKesson Health Solutions, which includes our InterQual® clinical criteria solution, claims payment solutions and network performance tools.  This segment also delivers enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions, as well as connectivity, outsourcing and other services, including remote hosting and managed services, to healthcare organizations.  This segment’s customers include hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail pharmacies and payers primarily from North America.

Net revenues for our segments for the last three years were as follows:

This business also provides practice management and other consulting services to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and third party payers supporting the clinical research and distribution of specialty pharmaceutical products and services.

Competition

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Distribution Solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition, both in price and service, from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations.  In addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment.  Price, quality of service, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment.

Our Technology Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry.  Competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses

McKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services.  We pursue patent protection for our innovation, and obtain copyrights covering our original works of authorship, when such protection is advantageous.  Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide.  In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries.  Generally, our employees are required to execute agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and establish an obligation to assign to McKesson intellectual property that they create during their employment.

We believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson’s confidential information, patents, copyrights, and trademarks are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same.  We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers.  We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents and other intellectual property rights.  These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities.  While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operation.

We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson’s products or services.  While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.

We also have agreements with group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers.  The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs.  Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Distribution Solutions segment.

accounted for approximately

46%

of our purchases.

A significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases.  In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices.  For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin.

Our Technology Solutions segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other customers.  We believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the long-term success of this business.  Additional information regarding our development activities is included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental Regulation:

Our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites.  We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.



McKESSON CORPORATION

We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business.  We meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program.

We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations.  Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites.  These matters are described further in Financial Note 22, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the Company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs.  Environmental costs and accruals, including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations, are presently not material to our operations or financial position.  Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters.  Other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations, we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future.  The amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in


and is not expected to be material in the next year.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

The risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.  Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations.  The reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.

Changes in the United States healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the United States.  In recent years, the healthcare industry in the United States has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs.  These changes have included cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups.  We expect the healthcare industry in the United States to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future.

Changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income.  Due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services.

The majority of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business’ agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  In addition,  branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers.  If the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

In addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation.  In recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drug formularies available in the marketplace.  In fiscal year 2015, we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to increase as compared to the prior year.  Continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products.  During the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent.  To the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us.  While we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses and computer-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins, and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the Company to litigation and regulatory investigations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Healthcare Fraud:

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, and the government, both state and federal, continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs.  Our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid.  Many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts.  They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations.  If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.

Reimbursements:

Both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.  For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the “Affordable Care Act”), signed into law in 2010, revised the federal upper limits for Medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price (“AMP”) using a smoothing process.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has proposed new rules for calculating AMP (“Revised AMP”) and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost (“AAC”) method or the national average drug acquisition cost benchmark (“NADAC”).  Under AAC and NADAC, reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey.  States will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate Medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs.  We expect that the use of a Revised AMP benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric, such as AAC or NADAC, would result in a reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability.

The federal government may adopt measures that could reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities.  For example, under the terms of the Budget Control Act of 2011, an automatic 2% reduction of Medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after April 1, 2013.  This automatic reduction is known as “sequestration.”  Medicare generally reimburses physicians for Part B drugs at the rate of average sales price (“ASP”) plus 6%. The implementation of sequestration pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the ASP plus 6% level for the duration of sequestration (which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation).   Additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, or both.  We cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or Medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or effect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us.

There can be no assurance that the preceding changes would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Operating, Security and Licensure Standards:

We are subject to the operating and security standards of the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the CMS and other comparable agencies.  Certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the DEA, FDA, HHS, CMS, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale.  In addition, and as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities.  Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses.  Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Pedigree Tracking:

There have been increasing efforts by Congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the FDA, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system (“pedigree tracking”).    In November 2013, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”).  The DQSA will establish federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable, lot-level prescription drug track and trace system.  The law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements.

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, which went into effect on October 1, 2007, requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs.  These standards may include any track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies.  On March 26, 2010, the FDA released the Serialized Numerical Identifier (“SNI”) guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging.  We expect to be able to accommodate these SNI regulations in our distribution operations.  The DQSA and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Privacy:

State, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released.  These regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures.  Regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.  Although we modified our policies, procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal and foreign laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, new laws and regulations in this area could restrict our or our customers’ ability to obtain, use or disseminate personal or patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  In addition, the HITECH Act expanded HIPAA privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations.  It also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customers.  These standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations.  Furthermore, our failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.

Healthcare Reform

:    The Affordable Care Act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. While certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. We do not currently anticipate that the Affordable Care Act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, given the scope of the changes made and under consideration, as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms, we cannot predict their full effect on the Company at this time.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Interoperability Standards and Meaningful Use Requirement:

There is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other.  This demand for interoperability is leading to the development of standards by various groups, such as Commonwell Health Alliance, which the Company and other healthcare IT companies announced in 2013. Certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies, or used by our customers.  For example, the HITECH Act requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government.  Although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification while others are on track to receive certification, rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future.  As a result, we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products, and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle. We also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue.  To the extent these rules subsequently are changed or supplemented, or  we are delayed in receiving certification for our products, customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products.

FDA Regulation of Medical Software:

The FDA has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology  products as medical devices under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. For example, in 2011 the FDA issued a rule on medical device data systems (MDDS) that now regulates certain software systems that electronically store, transfer or display data originating from medical devices as Class 1 medical devices (i.e., those devices deemed by the FDA to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls) themselves.  If the FDA chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the FDA could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. Any additional FDA regulations governing health information technology products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products.

Standards for Submission of Healthcare Claims

:  HHS previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement.  The first rule modifies the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from Version 4010/4010A to Version 5010.  The enforcement deadline for the 5010 rule was extended through June 30, 2012 and many healthcare providers began implementing the 5010 rule.  The second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (“ICD-9”) to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (“ICD-10”).  As a consequence of the passage of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 in March, the compliance date for ICD-10 conversion has been postponed from October 1, 2014 to October 1, 2015.  Updating systems to Version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) is required for use of the ICD-10 code set.  Generally, claims submitted not using Version 5010 and ICD-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using Version 5010 and ICD-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries.  We may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules.  In addition, these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue.  Delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers’ decisions to purchase our software and systems.

Medical Billing and Coding:

Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws.  In connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs.  Any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Changes in the Canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The provincial governments in Canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs.  Similar to the United States, the Canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce program costs.  For example, the Ontario government significantly revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the Transparent Drug System for Patients Act.  In recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, various provinces took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs.  These changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers.  These reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the Company’s operations in Canada.  Other provinces are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees.  Individually or in combination, such changes in the Canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our Canadian revenue and operating profit.

Changes in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

In Europe, we are subject to the European Union (“EU”) data protection regulations, including the EU Directive on Data Protection, which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. The EU regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security.  In addition to this EU-wide legislation, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards.  The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

We have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. The Company’s acquisition of Celesio significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth.

Our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks.  Operations outside of the United States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations in both the United States and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.  Political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.  We may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad.  Additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations, including uncertainty regarding the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling and the Brazilian real, that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Since substantially all of Celesio’s revenues are generated outside of the United States, the Company’s acquisition of Celesio significantly increases our exposure to these risks.

Foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions.  The U.K. Bribery Act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery.   Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

We also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues.  For example, the FDA has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the U.S. from overseas plants due to quality issues.  Difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully.

An element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business.  Integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses.  Further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities.  In addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets.  If we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected.

On February 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio.  Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted shares was 75.6%.  At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 75.4% of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares.   Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.  Celesio’s headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world.  The acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide.

Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of Celesio’s product and services. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition.

Any significant diversion of management’s attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results, both prior to and after the acquisition of Celesio.  Moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Events outside of our control, including the market price of Celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition, changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of Celesio.



McKESSON CORPORATION

The process to obtain operational control of Celesio, including Celesio shareholder approval of the domination and profit and loss agreement and registration of the domination and profit and loss agreement in the Celesio corporate register is complex and we do not expect to complete the steps required to exercise operating control of Celesio until late in the first half of our fiscal 2015.  Until the domination and profit and loss agreement is registered and effective, Celesio will not be subject to direct management control by us and Celesio’s profits can only be distributed by the declaration of dividends. In the event that a minority shareholder of Celesio files an action to challenge the registration, or the registration is delayed by German courts, it may prevent us from exercising operational control of Celesio on the anticipated timeline, or at all. Our pursuit of the Celesio acquisition and the preparation for the integration of Celesio’s business over an extended period of time may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources, as well as the management and internal resources of Celesio.  In the event that our acquisition of Celesio’s remaining then outstanding common shares is significantly delayed, it may prevent the Celesio acquisition from being consummated on the anticipated timeline, which could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, and could result in our incurring significant expenses related to the Celesio acquisition without realizing the expected benefits.

We are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.

From time- to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, tort and other various claims.  All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages.  In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought.  For some complaints filed against the Company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the Company.

The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur.  The Company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously.  Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations.  The defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business.  Even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation.

European economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain European governments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The Company’s acquisition of Celesio significantly increases our assets and operations within Europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in Europe. A further slowdown within the European economy could affect our business in Europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. In recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in Europe, a number of European governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. For example, in 2011, the French government introduced a new wholesale mark-up system that constrained distribution margins on pharmaceuticals. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay.

Countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, European governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. New austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Competition may erode our profit.

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Distribution Solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations.  In addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment.  Price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment.

In recent years, pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation.  As a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market.  Accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers.  Many healthcare organizations have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power.  If this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services.  In addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including IT systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base.

Our Technology Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry.  Competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.  These competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

A material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers.  During


, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately

48%

of our total consolidated revenues.  Sales to our largest customer,

CVS

, accounted for approximately

16%

of our total consolidated revenues.  At

March 31, 2014

, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately

32%

of total trade accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable from

CVS

were approximately

12%

of total trade accounts receivable.  As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant.  We also have agreements with group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies.  A material default in payment, change in our customer mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

We generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured.  Any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow.  Further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability.

Contracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.

Contracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls.  Government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding.  Contracts with the U.S. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of Congressional funding.  Governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated.  As a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.  The loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

In addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements.  For example, for contracts with the U.S. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and the Cost Accounting Standards.  We must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting.  These regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations.  Government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts.

We also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings.  For example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations.  These audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies.

If we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government including disallowance of costs claimed, monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties.  In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work.  The occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the United States or abroad.

Public health issues, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers.  We have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary.  However, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.  We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are dependent upon sophisticated information systems. The malfunction, failure or breach of these systems to perform as designed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. We also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis; (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and (4) process payments to suppliers.  In Europe, Celesio outsources its IT infrastructure to an external service provider.  If these systems are interrupted, damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, including a cyber attack, or fail for any extended period of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Cyber attacks can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional incidents involving unauthorized access to computer systems or data that could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information, the corruption of data, or other disruption of business operations. Similarly, denial-of-service or other Internet-based attacks may range from mere vandalism of electronic systems to systematic theft of sensitive information and intellectual property.  Although we actively devote significant resources to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all information in our possession, preventing all cyber incidents is inherently difficult.  Therefore, any compromise of our electronic systems, including the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive information or a significant disruption of our computing assets and networks, would adversely affect our reputation, our ability to fulfill contractual obligations and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  Moreover, unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of such sensitive information could result in a civil, criminal or regulatory action, including potential fines and penalties.  Any real or perceived compromise of our security or disclosure of sensitive information may also result in lost revenues by deterring customers from using or purchasing our products and services in the future.



McKESSON CORPORATION

We could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance.

In order to provide prompt and complete service to our major Distribution Solutions segment’s customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers.  While we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms.  One or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses (which include care management programs and our nurse advice services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans.  If customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products.  We attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages.  Additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient.  We also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products.  In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.  A successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The acquisition of Celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services.  Pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. Although Celesio maintains liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims.  If Celesio’s insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or Celesio suffers reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations.

Our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our Technology Solutions segment, deliver enterprise‑wide and single entity clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and  strategic management software solutions to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers.  Challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our Technology Solutions segment.

Future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses.  Such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete.

The success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models.  To remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis.  The failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Proprietary protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions.  There can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours.  In addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement.  Although we believe that our products, solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future.  If we were found to be infringing others’ rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements.  Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.  These types of litigation can be costly and time consuming.  These litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

System errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The software and technology services (“systems”) that we sell or operate are complex.  As with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced.  For example, our Technology Solutions segment’s business systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care.  Therefore, users of our systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products.  If our software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients.  In addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales.

Failure of a customer’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation.  If such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages.

Various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center, exposing us to significant costs.

We provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers.  The ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers.  Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber attacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems.  We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks.  If customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care.  If customers’ access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information.  We must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments.  Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services.



McKESSON CORPORATION

The length of our sales and implementation cycles for our Technology Solutions segment could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.

Many of the solutions offered by our Technology Solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation.  How and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations.  Many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer.  Any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  Furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue.

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.

We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist.  Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time.  In addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value.  We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined.  This could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  There are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets.  Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge.

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions.  As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions.  From time-to-time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions.  There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation.  For example, if legislation is passed to repeal the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow.  Additionally, if legislation is passed to change the current U.S. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues, it may adversely impact our tax expense.  The tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.  Even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers.

Volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements.  Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

Our $1.35 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will expire in November 2014.  Historically, we have primarily used the accounts receivable sales facility to fund working capital requirements, as needed.  We anticipate extending or renewing this facility before its expiration.  Although we believe we will be able to renew this facility, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.

Our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.  As a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale.  Additionally, if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives.  Any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow.

Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded.  Accordingly, from time-to-time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC.  It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

We could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities.

We participate in various “multiemployer” pension plans.  In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional cash contribution to the plans, payable in installments and/or lump sum.  Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. Our multiemployer plans could have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview:

NM - not meaningful

Revenues for 2014 increased from 2013 primarily due to market growth, reflecting growing drug utilization and price increases,  our acquisitions of Celesio AG (“Celesio”) and PSS World Medical, Inc. (“PSS World Medical”) which were completed in February 2014 and 2013, and our mix of business. Revenues for 2014 were also impacted by price deflation associated with brand to generics drug conversion.  Revenues for 2013 approximated 2012 primarily reflecting market growth, net of price deflation.

Gross profit and gross profit margin increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions, growth in sales of  higher margin generic drugs, higher buy margin and our mix of business, partially offset by a decrease in sell margin.  Additionally, 2014 gross profit was impacted by LIFO-related inventory charges of $311 million.

Operating expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs.  Operating expenses in 2013 were favorably impacted by an $81 million non-cash gain on business combination and lower Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation charges, partially offset by a $40 million charge for a legal dispute and a $36 million charge for goodwill impairment.   AWP litigation charges were

$68 million

,

$72 million

and

$149 million

in


,


and


.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased in 2014 and 2013 reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating and interest expenses.  Increased interest expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to our acquisition of Celesio.   Additionally, in 2013 we committed to a plan to sell our 49% equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V (“Nadro”) and recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $191 million reducing the investment’s carrying value to its estimated fair value.  Nadro was sold in 2014 with no material gain or loss on its disposition.

Our reported income tax rates were

35.4%

,

30.1%

and

27.2%

in


,


and


.  Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates, and discrete items.  Income tax expense included

$94

million of net discrete tax expense in


, and

$29

million and

$66

million of net discrete tax benefit in


and


.  Discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a

$122 million

charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. Included in the


discrete tax benefit is a

$31

million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit relating to our AWP litigation.

During 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology business and our Hospital Automation business from our Technology Solutions segment and certain small businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment.  In the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of $80 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated net realizable value (fair value less costs to sell).

Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was

$1,263 million

$1,338 million

and

$1,403 million

and


, and diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation were

$5.41

,

$5.59

and

$5.59

.   Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding primarily due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases.

On February 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired.  Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted shares was 75.6% and as required, we consolidated Celesio’s debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet.  At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 75.4% of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares.  The acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable facility and cash on hand.  Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.  Celesio’s headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world.  The acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide.

Distribution Solutions

North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to market growth, reflecting growing drug utilization and price increases, and our mix of business.  These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generics drug conversion.  North America revenues for 2013 approximated 2012 primarily due to market growth and our mix of business, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions, the loss of customers and fewer sales days.

International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $

4.8 billion

in 2014 represents revenues from Celesio, our majority-owned subsidiary, acquired in February 2014.

Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in

primarily due to our acquisition of PSS World Medical in February 2013 and market growth.  Revenues for


increased compared to


primarily due to market growth, new customers and our acquisition of PSS World Medical. These 2013 increases were partially offset by five less sales days.

Technology Solutions

Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions and a higher volume of claims processing.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software product revenues.  Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to acquisitions, higher volume of claims processing revenues and an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Distribution Solutions

Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions,  growth in sales of higher margin generic drugs, and an increase in buy margin. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin and charges related to the LIFO method of accounting for inventories, as further described below.  Additionally, gross profit was impacted by a $50 million charge for the reversal of a fair value step-up of inventory acquired as part of the Celesio acquisition.  Gross profit margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher sales of generic drugs, business acquisitions, an increase in buy margin and antitrust settlement receipts, and a lower proportion of revenues within the segment attributed to lower-margin sales to customers’ warehouses.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin.

Our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) net inventory expense was

$311

million in


,

$13

million in


and

$11

million in


.  Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods.  The practice in the Distribution Solutions segment’s distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers.  Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses.  A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity.  A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.

From 2005 through 2011, we experienced net price deflation and in 2012 and 2013, we began to experience a modest net inflationary trend in our pharmaceuticals indices, as price increases on branded pharmaceuticals exceeded the impact of price declines and shifts toward generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. As a result of this cumulative net price deflation, at March 31, 2013, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $60 million more than market and, accordingly, a $60 million lower-of-cost or market (“LCM”) reserve reduced inventories to market.   During 2014, we experienced net inflation in our pharmaceutical inventories.  As a result, in 2014, we recorded LIFO charges of

$311

million to cost of sales, net of the LCM reserve release.  As of March 31, 2014, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO did not exceed market.  At March 31, 2014  and March 31, 2013, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments were $431 million and $120 million.   Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this Financial Review.

Technology Solutions

Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in higher-margin revenues, partially offset by product alignment charges.  Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to a change in product and services mix and a decline in product alignment charges partially offset by a $10 million impairment of capitalized software held for sale.

In 2014, this segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million.  These charges primarily consisted of $35 million of product alignment charges, $15 million of integration-related expenses and $7 million of reduction-in-workforce severance charges.  Included in the total charge was $35 million for severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and $15 million for asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs for a product that will no longer be developed.  Charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows: $34 million in cost of sales and $23 million in operating expenses.

In 2013, this segment recorded $46 million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges.  These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product.  The charge included a $36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value.  In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis.  This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations.   The balance of the charge represents a $10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value.  We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value.  This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within this segment.  As part of this alignment strategy, we began converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon’s Microsoft®-based platform.  We also stopped development of our HzERM software product.  As the result of this plan, we recorded product alignment charges of $51 million, of which $31 million was recorded to cost of sales and $20 million was recorded to operating expenses.

Operating expenses in 2013 were also impacted by lower AWP charges and a $40 million charge for a legal dispute in our Canadian business.

The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims.  Charges related to AWP litigation, including accrued interest, are recorded in operating expenses within our Distribution Solutions segment. Such pre-tax charges were $68 million, $72 million and $149 million in 2014, 2013  and 2012.

Corporate

Corporate expenses increased in

primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs, acquisition‑related expenses and the 2013 $81 million gain on business combination.  Corporate expenses decreased in


compared to


primarily due to the gain on business combination and a charitable contribution in 2012.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in a reserve for an environmental liability, acquisition-related expenses and other corporate initiatives.

In 2013, we purchased the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California for $90 million, which was funded from cash on hand.  We previously held a 50% ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building.  This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition, which requires that we re-measure our previously held 50% ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations.  The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of $81 million ($51 million after-tax), which was recorded as a gain on business combination within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations.

Acquisition expenses and related adjustments by segment were as follows:

Amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions recorded in operating expenses were $308 million, $196 million and $167 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012.  The increases in amortization expense reflect our recent business acquisitions.   Additionally, certain intangible assets associated with a 2007 acquisition were fully amortized in 2012.

Other Income, Net:

Other income, net decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio including acquisition‑related expenses.  Other income, net increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an impairment of an asset in 2012.

Impairment of an Equity Investment:

In 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our

49%

equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”) and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of

$191

million reducing the investment’s carrying value to its estimated fair value.  The charge reflected deterioration in Nadro’s market position, projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in Mexico.  Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of

$69

million were included in the assessment of the investment’s carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge.  Cumulative foreign currency translation losses (net of tax), were included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2013.  The charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment.  In September 2013, we completed the sale of our

49%

equity interest in Nadro.  Under the terms of the agreement, we received

$41

million in total cash consideration.  There was no material gain or loss on the disposition based on the adjusted net realizable value of the investment at the time of the sale.

Segment Operating Profit, Corporate Expenses, Net and Interest Expense:

Distribution Solutions:

Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment in 2014 was flat compared to 2013, primarily  reflecting an increase in gross profit margin and the $191 million impairment charge on an equity investment incurred in 2013, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which includes the effects of our acquisitions. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the $191 million impairment charge on an equity investment and higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included the effects of our acquisitions.

Interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio, including $46 million of bridge loan fees, interest on $4.1 billion of new debt issued to fund the acquisition and interest on debt of Celesio.  These increases are partially offset by repayment of  $500 million of the current portion of our long-term debt in March 2013.  Interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012  primarily due to the repayment of $400 million of long-term debt in February 2012, partially offset by $11 million of bridge loan fees paid in connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical.  Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt that is repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred for bridge loan fees.

Income Taxes

Our reported income tax rates were

35.4%

30.1%

and

27.2%

in

$94

million of net discrete tax expense in


, and

$29

million and

$66

million of net discrete tax benefit in

charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. Included in the


discrete tax benefit is a

$31

million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit relating to our AWP litigation.

We have received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of $219 million related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2009.  We previously appealed the reassessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2009.  On December 13, 2013, the Tax Court of Canada dismissed our appeal of the reassessment with respect to 2003.  On January 10, 2014, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal in response to the judgment of the Tax Court of Canada.  As a result of the unfavorable Tax Court decision relating to 2003, we recognized a discrete tax expense of $122 million in the third quarter of 2014, which includes tax and interest for the years 2003 through 2013.  The ultimate resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense.

We have received tax assessments of $98 million from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) relating to 2003 through 2006.  We are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process.  We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements.

in 2014 and 2013, and income of

$24 million

in 2012.  Results for 2014 include a non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of $80 million.

In 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology business and our Hospital Automation business from our Technology Solutions segment and certain small businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment.  During the third quarter of 2014, we recorded the $80 million impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated net realizable value (fair value less costs to sell).  The charge was primarily the result of the terms of the preliminary purchase offers received for  all of the business during the third quarter of 2014.  A portion of the impairment charge was attributed to goodwill and other long-lived assets and as a result, there was no tax benefit associated with this portion of the charge. The ultimate selling price of our International Technology business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of fair value.

In 2014, we sold our Hospital Automation business for cash proceeds of $55 million, which approximates the business’ net book value. The results of operations for these businesses are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Fiscal 2014

On February 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of

$4.5 billion

, net of cash acquired (the “Acquisition”).  Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted shares was 75.6% and, as required, we consolidated Celesio’s debt with a fair value of

$2.3 billion

as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet.  The Acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable facility and cash on hand.  Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.  Celesio’s headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world.  The acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide.

Our acquisition of Celesio was consummated through a series of transactions:

•

129.3 million of common shares of Celesio were acquired from Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH (“Haniel”) for cash consideration of €23.50 per common share or $4,128 million.

•

4,840 of the 7,000 convertible bonds issued by Celesio in the nominal aggregate amount of

€350 million

due in October 2014 (the “2014 Bonds”), and 2,180 of the

From February 7, 2014 through March 31, 2014, we converted our remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds into

11.9 million

of Celesio common shares.  Also during this time period, substantially all of the remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds held by third parties were converted to

9 million

Celesio common shares valued at $313 million and approximately

$30 million

in cash. At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately

75.4%

of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares.

In accordance with a business combination agreement that we entered into with Celesio in January 2014, on February 28, 2014 and April 7, 2014 we launched voluntary public tender offers for the common shares of Celesio that remain outstanding for

€23.50

per share.  In April 2014, the last of these tender offers expired and we acquired 1 million of additional common shares.  We also intend to enter into a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement, with Celesio as the dominated party, pursuant to Sections 291 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz - AktG). Such a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement does not require any further regulatory approval.

Fiscal 2013

In addition to our April 2012 acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, on February 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of PSS World Medical for $29.00 per share plus the assumption of PSS World Medical’s debt, or approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $0.6 billion.  The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt.  PSS World Medical markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the United States.  The acquisition of PSS World Medical expands our existing Medical-Surgical business.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations.  Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition.  Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services.  Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories.  We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans.  We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.

In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection.  If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment.  As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt.  During


, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately

48%

of our total consolidated revenues.  Sales to our largest customer,

CVS Caremark Corporation ("CVS")

, accounted for approximately

16%

of our total consolidated revenues.  At

March 31, 2014

, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately

32%

of total trade accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable from

CVS

were approximately

12%

of total trade accounts receivable.  As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant.  A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends.  In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present.  We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in


are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed.  At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue.

At March 31,


, trade and notes receivables were $12,755 million prior to allowances of $113 million.  In


,


and


our provision for bad debts was $38 million, $28 million and $30 million.  At March 31,


and


, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 0.9% and 1.4%.  An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the


allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $13 million.  The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.  Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Inventories:

We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”).  Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale.  For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method.  The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”).  Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost.  Rebates, cash discounts  and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold.  Total inventories were

$13.3 billion

and

$10.3 billion

at March 31,


and


.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The LIFO method was used to value approximately

67%

and

80%

of our inventories at March 31,


and


.  If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $431 million and $120 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2014 and 2013.  These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves.  Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products.  In


,


, and


, we recognized net LIFO expense of

$311

million,

$13

million and

$11

million within our consolidated statements of operations.  A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity.  A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.

We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”).  As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market.  Primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were

$60

million higher than market as of March 31,


.  As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of

$60

million and

$16

million in


and


within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market.

In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales.  Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories.  We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete, as a result of these reviews.  These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.

Business Combinations:

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values.  Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.

Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  For intangible assets, we typically use the income method.  This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset.  These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.  Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry.  Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.  Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

As a result of acquiring businesses, we have

$9,927 million

and

$6,405 million

of goodwill at March 31,


and


and

$5,022 million

and

$2,270 million

of intangible assets, net at March 31,


and


.  We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired.  We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist.  Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time.

Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.  Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services, customers and operating margin are aggregated as a single reporting unit.  Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value.  This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss.  Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test.  If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment  charge is recorded for that excess.

To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach.  Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets.  Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return.  In addition, we compare the aggregate of the  reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.

Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business.  Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units.

Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time.  Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations.  The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management.  Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge.  In 2014 and 2012, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.  In 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in our Technology Solutions segment. For our newly-acquired Celesio operations, we determined the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using various methods, including an overall discounted cash flow analysis performed for all of Celesio’s operations.  As of March 31, 2014, the fair value assignments were preliminary and could change significantly upon finalization of the fair value assignments.

Currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to thirty-eight years.  We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.  Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective.  They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.  There were no material impairments of intangibles in


,


or


.  Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Supplier Reserves:

We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them.  These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available.  We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances.  As of March 31,


and


, supplier reserves were

$181

million and

$164

million.  The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate.  All of the supplier reserves at March 31,


and


pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment.  An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31,


would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $22 million in


.  The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.

Income Taxes:

Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties.  We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.  In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.  These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.  We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of

$1,332 million

and

$1,247 million

at March 31,


and


and deferred tax liabilities of

$4,133 million

and

$3,114 million

.  Deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and intangible assets.  We established valuation allowances of

$270 million

and

$118 million

for


and


against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain.  Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.  Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted.

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.  We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due.  These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities.  These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest.  If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result.  If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.

If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $21 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for


.

Loss Contingencies:

We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business.  When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.  However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.  Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.  When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision.  We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made.  As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties.  Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facilities, revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.  In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time-to-time.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Financing activities for 2013 included cash receipts of $1,325 million and cash paid of $1,725 million from short-term borrowings.  In addition, in connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical, we borrowed $900 million for bridge financing in February 2013, which was fully repaid in March 2013.  Financing activities for 2013 also include cash receipts of $1,798 million for the issuance of long-term debt and cash paid of $1,143 million for repayments of long-term debt.  In December 2012, we issued $500 million of 0.95% Notes due 2015 and $400 million of 2.70% Notes due 2022.  In March 2013, we issued $500 million of 1.40% Notes due 2018 and $400 million of 2.85% Notes dues 2023.  Long-term debt repayments include $500 million paid on the maturity of our 5.25% Notes due in March 2013 and $635 million paid to redeem the debt acquired on the acquisition of PSS World Medical.  Additionally, financing activities for 2013 included $1,214 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $194 million of dividends paid.

Financing activities for


included $1,874 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $400 million of cash paid on the maturity of our 7.75% Notes in February 2012, $195 million of dividends paid, $400 million of cash receipts from secured borrowings and $167 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options.

The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods.  The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.

The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common stock as follows: $1.0 billion in April 2010, $1.0 billion in October 2010, $1.0 billion in April 2011, $650 million in January 2012, $700 million in April 2012 and $500 million in January 2013.  Total share repurchases transacted through ASR programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows:

(1)

Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding.

The total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company’s common stock was $340 million at March 31, 2014.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately 2 million shares repurchased for $217 million by the Company.   The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares.  We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.  As such, $195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.

We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future.  However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources:

(1)

Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, excluding noncontrolling interests.

(2)

Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (“net debt”), divided by the sum of net debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, excluding noncontrolling interests (“net capital employed”).

(3)

Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, excluding noncontrolling interests.

Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value.  Cash equivalents  are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury bonds, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.

The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. Deposits at U.S. banks exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.  Within the Celesio operations, the majority of deposits are placed in Germany with only banks that are part of deposit protection programs.

Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31,


included approximately $2.4 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States.  Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time.  Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax.

Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities.  Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.  Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.

Consolidated working capital increased at March 31,


compared to March 31,


primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, and increases in receivables, inventories  and current portion of long-term debt associated with our acquisition of Celesio.  Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31,


compared to March 31,


, primarily due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance.

Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31,


compared to March 31,


primarily due to the increase in debt associated with our Celesio acquisition.  Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31,


compared to March 31,


primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance.

In July 2013, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.20 to $0.24 per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board.  Dividends were $0.92 per share in 2014 and $0.80 per share in 2013 and 2012.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.  However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.

Contractual Obligations:

The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31,


:

(1)

Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations.

(2)

Represents our estimated benefit payments, including assumed executive lump sum payments, for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans.  Actual lump sum payments could significantly differ from the estimated amounts depending on the timing of executive retirements and the lump sum interest rate in effect upon retirement.

(3)

Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long-term debt obligations.

(4)

A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company.  These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and service agreements.

(5)

Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases.

(6)

Includes agreements under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory and our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions.

At March 31, 2014, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $489 million.  Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table.

In addition, at March 31,


, our banks and insurance companies have issued

$161

million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.

Credit Resources:

We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facilities, revolving credit facilities and from commercial paper issuances.

Senior Bridge Term Loan Facilities

In connection with our acquisition of Celesio, in January 2014, we entered into a $5.5 billion 364‑day unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (the “2014 Bridge Loan”) under terms substantially similar to those in our existing revolving credit facility.  On February 4, 2014, we borrowed $4,957 million under this facility, with such proceeds and cash on hand used to fund the acquisition of Celesio.  On March 10, 2014, we repaid $4,076 million of the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings with funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt.  On March 11, 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings using funds drawn on our Accounts Receivable Sales facility and cash on hand.  On April 30, 2014, the commitments under the 2014 Bridge Loan automatically terminated upon the settlement of the tender offers for the remaining common shares of Celesio.  During the time it was outstanding, the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings bore interest at 1.39% per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating.  Interest expense for 2014 includes a total of $46 million of fees related to the 2014 Bridge Loan and a bridge loan agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2014 in anticipation of an earlier acquisition of Celesio.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical, in December 2012 we entered into a $2.1 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“2013 Bridge Loan”).  In February 2013, we reduced the 2013 Bridge Loan commitment to $900 million.   On February 22, 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the 2013 Bridge Loan, with such proceeds and cash on hand were used to redeem the assumed debt from PSS World Medical and pay the equity shareholders of PSS World Medical.  On March 8, 2013, we repaid the 2013 Bridge Loan borrowings with funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt and the bridge loan agreement was subsequently terminated.  During the time it was outstanding, the 2013 Bridge Loan borrowings bore interest at 1.20% per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating.  Interest expense for 2013 includes $11 million of fees related to the 2013 Bridge Loan.

Celesio Debt

Upon our acquisition of Celesio, as required, we consolidated a total of $2.3 billion of outstanding debt of Celesio as a liability  on our consolidated balance sheet.  The Celesio debt consists primarily of corporate bonds, convertible debt, promissory notes and amounts outstanding under their accounts receivable facility arrangements and lines of credits.  Debt maturities range from our fiscal years 2015 to 2024.  As of March 31, 2014, Celesio convertible debt of

$344 million

was extinguished through the issuance of Celesio common stock or cash.  As of March 31, 2014,

$246 million

and $188 million were outstanding under the accounts receivable factoring facility arrangements and lines of credits with committed balances of $308 million and $1,662 million.

According to certain terms and conditions of Celesio’s 4.00% bonds maturing on October 18, 2016 and their 4.50% bonds maturing on April 26, 2017, effective May 7, 2014 bondholders have the option to ask for repayment of the bonds at par value plus accrued interest.   If bondholders do not exercise this option by May 19, 2014, the bonds will remain outstanding until their respective maturity dates. Accordingly, as at March 31, 2014, these bonds having a book value of $1,244 million have been classified as a current liability.   As of May 7, 2014, the fair value of these bonds of $1,272 million was more than their par value of $1,184 million.

PSS World Medical Debt

Upon our acquisition of PSS World Medical, we assumed the outstanding debt of PSS World Medical.  Prior to our acquisition, PSS World Medical called for redemption of all of its outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2022.  Due to the change in control provisions of the 3.125% Senior Convertible Notes due 2014, the notes were convertible to cash at the option of the note holders.  All the note holders opted to receive cash.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, we redeemed both of these notes, including accrued interest for $643 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our 2013 PSS Bridge Loan.

Long-Term Debt

In connection with the acquisition of Celesio, on March 5, 2014, we issued floating rate notes (“Floating Rate Notes”) due September 10, 2015 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, 1.29% notes due March 10, 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of $700 million (“2017 Notes”), 2.28% notes due March 15, 2019 in an aggregate principal amount of $1,100 million (“2019 Notes”), 3.80% notes due March 15, 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $1,100 million (“2024 Notes”) and 4.88% notes due March 15, 2044 in an aggregate principal amount of $800 million (“2044 Notes”). The Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 0.40% (0.64% at March 31, 2014).  We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses of $4,068 million from the issuance of these notes (each note constitutes a “Series”) to repay borrowings under the 2014 Bridge Loan.

On March 8, 2013, we issued 1.40% notes due March 15, 2018 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and 2.85% notes due March 15, 2023 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million.  We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses of $891 million from the issuance of these notes (each note constitutes a “Series”) to repay borrowings under the 2013 Bridge Loan.

On December 4, 2012, we issued 0.95% notes due December 4, 2015 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (“2015 Notes”) and 2.70% notes due December 15, 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million (“2022 Notes”).   We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $892 million from the issuance of these notes (each note constitutes a “Series”) for general corporate purposes and replenishing working capital that was used to repay long-term debt that matured.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Each Series constitutes an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Company and ranks equally with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness outstanding from time-to-time.  Each Series is governed by materially similar indentures and officers’ certificate specifying certain terms of each Series.

With the exception of the Floating Rate Notes, upon 30 days notice to holders of a Series, we may redeem that Series at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, for cash at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium, as specified in the indenture and officers’ certificate relating to that Series.  In the event of the occurrence of both (1) a change of control of the Company and (2) a downgrade of a Series below an investment grade rating by each of Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services within a specified period, an offer must be made to purchase that Series from the holders at a price in cash equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount of that Series, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase.  The indenture and the related officers’ certificate for each Series, subject to the exceptions and in compliance with the conditions as applicable, specify that we may not incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.  The indentures also contain customary events of default provisions.

We repaid our $350 million 6.50% Notes due February 15, 2014 and our $500 million 5.25% Notes due March 1, 2013, at maturity.

Scheduled future payments of long-term debt are $1,424 million in 2015, $1,535 million in 2016, $1,277 million in 2017, $520 million in 2018, $1,485 million in 2019 and $4,132 million thereafter.

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

We have an Accounts Receivable Sales facility (the “Facility”) with a committed balance of $1.35 billion, although from time-to-time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements.  Prior to the Celesio acquisition, we amended the Facility to extend the term for an additional year, increased the maximum debt to capital ratio from 56.5% to 65% and added an extended cure period with respect to defaults under the facility relating to Celesio.  The Facility will expire in November 2014 and we anticipate renewing the Facility before its expiration.

In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we borrowed $550 million, $1,325 million and $400 million under the Facility and we repaid $550 million, $1,725 million and nil.  At March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, there were no secured borrowings and related securitized accounts receivable outstanding under the Facility.

The Facility contains requirements relating to the performance of the accounts receivable and covenants relating to the Company.  If we do not comply with these covenants, our ability to use the Facility may be suspended and repayment of any outstanding balances under the Facility may be required.  At March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants.

Revolving Credit Facility

We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in September 2016. Prior to the Celesio acquisition, we amended this facility to increase the maximum debt to capital ratio from 56.5% to 65%, and added an extended cure period with respect to defaults under the credit facility relating to Celesio.  Borrowings under this renewed credit facility bear interest based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate or a prime rate.  There were no borrowings under this credit facility during 2014, 2013 and 2012.  As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.

Debt

Covenants

Our various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants.  Our principal debt covenant is our U.S. dollar denominated debt to capital ratio under our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 65%.  For the purpose of calculating this ratio, borrowings under the $1.35 billion Accounts Receivable Sales facility are excluded.  If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated.  As of March 31,


, we were in compliance with our financial covenants.

Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions.

Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 14, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest rate risk:

Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. At March 31, 2014, we had $1.0 billion in outstanding debt with variable interest rates.

Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates.  At March 31, 2014, we had $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2014 of approximately $12 million.

Foreign exchange risk:

Historically, we have recorded foreign revenues and earnings primarily from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries and Israel, which exposed us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our acquisition of a majority interest in Celesio in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and expanded our portfolio of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts.  As substantially all revenues and earnings of Celesio are generated outside of the United States, changes in the U.S. dollar relative to the functional currency in the countries in which Celesio operates, primarily the Euro and the British pound, could impact future earnings. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities.  Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts.  These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency loans.

As of March 31, 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of Celesio’s foreign exchange contracts by approximately $94 million.  As of March 31, 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our remaining foreign exchange contracts by approximately $40 million.  However, Celesio’s risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.  Refer to Financial Note 18, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward-exchange contracts.

The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.

McKESSON CORPORATION

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of McKesson Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting included all of our consolidated operations except for the operations of Celesio AG, which we acquired on February 6, 2014.  This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition. Celesio AG constituted

27%

of the total assets and

4%

of total revenues of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31,


.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has also audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,


.  This audit report appears on page 56 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

May 13, 2014



McKESSON CORPORATION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of McKesson Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31,


and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31,


.  Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule (“financial statement schedule”) listed in the Index at Item 15.  We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,


, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  As described in

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Celesio AG, which was acquired on February 6, 2014.  Celesio AG constituted 27% of the total assets and 4% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2014. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Celesio AG.  The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



McKESSON CORPORATION

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31,


and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31,


, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,


, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

FINANCIAL NOTES

1.

Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

:  McKesson Corporation (“McKesson,” the “Company,” the “Registrant” or “we” and other similar pronouns) delivers pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and healthcare information technology that make healthcare safer while reducing costs.  We conduct our business through two operating segments, McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions, as further described in Financial Note 25, “Segments of Business.”

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  The consolidated financial statements of McKesson include the financial statements of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned or controlled companies.  We also evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if they are variable interest entities (“VIEs”), if we have a variable interest in those entities and the nature and extent of those interests.  These evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical information and management’s judgment, among other factors.  Based on our evaluations, if we determine we are the primary beneficiary of such VIEs we consolidate such entities into our financial statements.  Refer to Financial Note 15, “Variable Interest Entities” for more information on these VIEs.  Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method and our proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in other income, net. Equity investments in non-publicly traded entities are primarily accounted for using the cost method.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Period:

The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31.  Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

Reclassifications

:  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual amounts could differ from those estimated amounts.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

:  All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.

Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value.  Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury bonds, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.

The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions.  Deposits at U.S. banks exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.  Within the Celesio operations, the majority of deposits are placed in Germany with only banks that are part of deposit protection programs.

Restricted Cash

:  Cash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash and is included within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets.  At March 31,


and


restricted cash was not material.

Marketable Securities Available-for-Sale

:  We carry our marketable securities, which are available-for-sale, at fair value and they are included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets.  The unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders’ equity.  At March 31,


and


marketable securities were not material.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in market value has occurred, we consider the duration that, and extent to which, the fair value of the investment is below its cost, the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security, and our intent and ability to retain the security in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Other-than-temporary declines in fair value from amortized cost for available-for-sale equity securities that we intend to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis are charged to other income (expense) in the period in which the loss occurs.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Receivables:

Our trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers primarily in our Distribution Solutions segment.  During


, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately

48%

of our total consolidated revenues.  Sales to our largest customer,

CVS Caremark Corporation ("CVS")

, accounted for approximately

16%

of our total consolidated revenues.  At March 31,


, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately

32%

of total trade accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable from

CVS

were approximately

12%

of total trade accounts receivable.  As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant.  We also have agreements with group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers.  The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs.  A default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or customer groups could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.  In addition, trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the institutional, retail and healthcare provider sectors, which can be affected by a downturn in the economy and changes in reimbursement policies.  This credit risk is mitigated by the size and diversity of the customer base as well as its geographic dispersion.  We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of our customers.  An allowance is recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.

Financing Receivables:

We assess and monitor credit risk associated with financing receivables, namely lease and notes receivables, through regular review of our collection experience in determining our allowance for loan losses.  On an ongoing basis, we also evaluate credit quality of our financing receivables utilizing aging of receivables and write-offs, as well as considering existing economic conditions, to determine if an allowance is necessary.  Financing receivables are derecognized if legal title to them has been transferred and all related risks and rewards incidental to ownership have passed to the buyer.  As of March 31,


and


, financing receivables and the related allowance were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories:

We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”).  Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale.  For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method.  The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase prices using the first-in, first-out method.  Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost.  Rebates,  cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold.

The LIFO method was used to value approximately

67%

and

80%

of our inventories at March 31,


and


.  If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately

$431

million and

$120

million higher than the amounts reported at March 31,


and


, respectively.  These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves.  Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products.  In


,


and


, we recognized net LIFO expense of

$311

million,

$13

million and

$11

million within our consolidated statements of operations.  A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity.  A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.

We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”).  As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market.  Primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were

$60

million higher than market as of March 31,


.  As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of

$60

million and

$16

million in


and


within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Shipping and Handling Costs:

We include costs to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver inventory to our customers in selling, distribution and administrative expenses.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

We state our property, plant and equipment at cost and depreciate them under the straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of properties over estimated service lives ranging from

one

to

thirty

years.

Goodwill:

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a                         component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit.  Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services, customers and operating margins are aggregated as a single reporting unit.

The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value.  This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss.  Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test.  If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess.

To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach.  Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets.  Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return.  The discount rate used for cash flows reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business.  In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair value to the Company’s market capitalization as a further corroboration of the fair values.  The testing requires a complex series of assumptions and judgment by management in projecting future operating results, selecting guideline companies for comparisons and assessing risks.  The use of alternative assumptions and estimates could affect the fair values and change the impairment determinations.

Intangible Assets:

Currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from

one

to

thirty-eight

years.  We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair market value.

Capitalized Software Held for Sale:

Development costs for software held for sale, which primarily pertain to our Technology Solutions segment, are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological feasibility.  Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life of approximately

three

years.  At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period.

Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use:

We capitalize costs of software held for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortize those costs over their estimated useful lives ranging from

one

to

ten

years.  As of March 31,


and


, capitalized software held for internal use was

$514

million and

$465

million, net of accumulated amortization of

$1,004

million and

$1,011

million, and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Insurance Programs:

Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract.  It is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses primarily related to workers’ compensation and comprehensive general, product and vehicle liability.  Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred as well as for claims incurred but not yet reported.  Such estimates utilize certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Revenue Recognition:

Distribution Solutions

Revenues for our Distribution Solutions segment are recognized when product is delivered and title passes to the customer or when services have been rendered and there are no further obligations to the customer.

Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances, rebates and other incentives.  Our sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if they can be resold for value or returned to suppliers for full credit.  Sales returns are accrued based on estimates at the time of sale to the customer.  Sales returns from customers were approximately

$1.9

billion in


,

$1.9

billion in


and

$1.6

billion in


.  Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis; that is, they are excluded from revenues.

Revenues for our Distribution Solutions segment include large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large customers who warehouse their own product.  We order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product primarily through our central distribution facility and deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers’ warehouses.  We also record revenues for direct store deliveries from most of these same customers.  Direct store deliveries are shipments from the manufacturer to our customers of a limited category of products that require special handling.  We assume the primary liability to the manufacturer for these products.

Revenues are recorded gross when we are the primary party obligated in the transaction, take title to and possession of the inventory, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices, assume the risk of loss for collection from customers as well as delivery or return of the product, are responsible for fulfillment and other customer service requirements, or the transactions have several but not all of these indicators.

Our Distribution Solutions segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain a combination of various products and services.  Revenue from a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price and recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element. Relative selling price is determined based on vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (“TPE”), if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price (“ESP”), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available.

Technology Solutions

Revenues for our Technology Solutions segment are generated primarily by licensing software and software systems (consisting of software, hardware and maintenance support), and providing claims processing, outsourcing and professional services.  Software and hardware are included in product revenue, while maintenance support among other services are included in service revenue.  Revenue for this segment is recognized as follows:

Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service agreements.  Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of delivery or under the percentage-of-completion method if the arrangements require significant production, modification or customization of the software.  Contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to total estimated labor hours to be incurred.  Changes in estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to earnings in the period in which they are determined.  We accrue for contract losses if and when the current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.

Revenue from time-based software license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.  Software implementation fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion method.  Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the period covered by the agreements.  Hardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery.

Subscription, content and transaction processing fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms beginning on the service start date for fixed fee arrangements and recognized as transactions are performed beginning on the service start date for per-transaction fee arrangements.  Remote processing service fees are recognized monthly as the service is performed.  Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the service is performed.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

We also offer certain products on an application service provider basis, making our software functionality available on a remote hosting basis from our data centers.  The data centers provide system and administrative support, as well as hosting services.  Revenue on products sold on an application service provider basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract beginning on the service start date of products hosted.

This segment engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain any combination of software, hardware, implementation or consulting services, or maintenance services.  For multiple element arrangements that do not include software, revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price and recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element.  Relative selling price is determined based on VSOE of selling price if available, TPE, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or ESP if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available.  For multiple-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with specific software accounting guidance when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and VSOE of fair value exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered elements is recognized upon delivery of such items.  The segment establishes VSOE for hardware and implementation and consulting services based on the price charged when sold separately, and for maintenance services, based on renewal rates offered to customers.  Revenue for the software element is recognized under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all of the undelivered elements in an arrangement.  If fair value cannot be established for any undelivered element, all of the arrangement’s revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last element or until the fair value of the undelivered element is determinable.  For multiple-element arrangements with both software elements and nonsoftware elements, arrangement consideration is allocated between the software elements as a whole and nonsoftware elements.  The segment then further allocates consideration to the individual elements within the software group, and revenue is recognized for all elements under the applicable accounting guidance and our policies described above.

Supplier Incentives:

Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold.  We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory.

Supplier Reserves:

We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them.  These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available.  We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances.  As of March 31,


and


supplier reserves were

$181

million and

$164

million.  The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different than our estimate.  All of the supplier reserves at March 31,


and


pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment.

Income Taxes:

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than

50 percent

likely of being realized upon effective settlements.  Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are considered to be permanently reinvested.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Our international subsidiaries generally consider their local currency to be their functional currency.  Assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.  Currency translation adjustments for the year are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets.  When we sell all or substantially all of an international entity, the related share of the cumulative currency translation adjustment is removed from stockholders’ equity and is included in the gain or loss on sale in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material to our consolidated results of operations in

Derivative Financial Instruments:

Derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings.  If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets.  The cumulative changes in fair value are reclassed to the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings.  We periodically evaluate hedge effectiveness, and ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings.  Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the change included in earnings.

Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income.  Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income.  Our other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, as well as

unrealized gains and losses on retirement-related benefit plans.

Noncontrolling Interests:

Noncontrolling interests primarily represent the portion of Celesio’s profit or loss, net assets and comprehensive income that is not allocable to McKesson Corporation.

Share-Based Compensation:

We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method.  The share-based compensation expense, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees.

Loss Contingencies:

We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business.  When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.  However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.  Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.  When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.

Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision.  We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made.  As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties.  Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Business Combinations:

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business,

100%

of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values.  Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.

Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  For intangible assets, we typically use the income method.  This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset.  These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams.  Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry.  Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Comprehensive Income:

In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted disclosure guidance related to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”).  The guidance requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI by component.  In addition, an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.  For amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts.  This guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Balance Sheet Offsetting:

In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted disclosure guidance related to the offsetting of assets and liabilities.  The guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting assets and liabilities for derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific GAAP criteria or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement.  The amended guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Cumulative Translation Adjustments:

In March 2013, amended guidance was issued for parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or group of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity.  The amended guidance requires the release of any cumulative translation adjustment into net income only upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of a controlling interest in a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity.  Also, it requires the release of all or a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment to net income in case of sale of an equity method investment that is a foreign entity.  The amended guidance is applicable to us effective first quarter of fiscal 2015.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued Operations:

In April 2014, amended guidance was issued for reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components.  The amended guidance raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and permits significant continuing involvement and continuing cash flows with the discontinued operation.  In addition, the amended guidance requires additional disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation.  The amended guidance is effective for us prospectively commencing in the first quarter of 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Business Combinations

Fiscal 2014

On

February 6, 2014

, we completed the acquisition of

77.6%

of the then outstanding common shares of

Celesio AG

(“Celesio”) and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of

$4.5 billion

, net of cash acquired (the “Acquisition”).  Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted common shares was

75.6%

and, as required, we consolidated Celesio’s debt with a fair value of

$2.3 billion

as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet.  The Acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable sales facility and cash on hand.

Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.  Celesio’s headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world

.  The acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide.

Our acquisition of Celesio was consummated through a series of transactions:

•

129.3

million of common shares of Celesio were acquired from Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH (“Haniel”) for cash consideration of

€23.50

per common share or

$4,128 million

.

•

4,840

of the

7,000

convertible bonds issued by Celesio in the nominal aggregate amount of

3,500

convertible bonds issued by Celesio in the nominal amount of

€350 million

due in April 2018 (the “2018 Bonds”) were acquired from Elliot International, L.P., The Liverpool Limited Partnership and Elliot Capital Advisers, L.P. (together, the “Elliot Group”) for cash consideration of

of the 2014 Bonds and


of the 2018 Bonds were acquired in private transactions for cash consideration of

$63 million

.


of the acquired 2018 Bonds were converted to

0.7 million

common shares of Celesio.

From February 7, 2014 through March 31, 2014, we converted our remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds into

11.9 million

of Celesio common shares.  Also during this time period, substantially all of the remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds held by third parties were converted to

9 million

of Celesio common shares valued at

$313 million

and approximately

$30 million

in cash.  At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately

75.4%

of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares.

In accordance with a business combination agreement that we entered into with Celesio in January 2014, on February 28, 2014 and April 7, 2014 we launched voluntary public tender offers for the common shares of Celesio that remain outstanding for

€23.50

per share.  In April 2014, the last of these tender offers expired and we acquired


million of additional common shares.  We also intend to enter into a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement, with Celesio as the dominated party, pursuant to Sections 291 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz - AktG). Such a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement does not require any further regulatory approval.

The following table summarizes the preliminary recording of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.  Due to the recent timing of the acquisition, these amounts are subject to change within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized.

Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of

$3,018 million

, the fair value of which was primarily determined by applying the income approach, using several significant unobservable inputs for projected cash flows and a discount rate

.

These inputs are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.

Acquired intangibles primarily consist of

$1,574 million

of customer relationships,

$1,202 million

of pharmacy licenses and

$172 million

of trademarks.  The estimated weighted average life of the customer relationships, pharmacy licenses, trademarks and total intangible assets are

eleven years

,

twenty-six years

,

fourteen years

and

seventeen years

.

The fair value of Celesio’s long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices in a less active market and other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.  The fair values of the conversion options on Celesio’s convertible bonds, which are classified as current liabilities, were determined by using an option pricing model that uses observable market data for all inputs, such as historical volatility of the Company’s common stock, risk-free interest rate and other factors that are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.

The fair value of the noncontrolling interests on the date of acquisition of

$1,500 million

was made up of the following components:

The fair value of the noncontrolling interests for the Celesio common shares that were not acquired by McKesson was determined by a quoted market price that is considered to be a Level 1 input under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.

The excess of the purchase price and the noncontrolling interests over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business.  Most of the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Financial results for Celesio since the acquisition date are included in the results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2014 within our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment.

The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, as if Celesio had been acquired as of April 1, 2012. The pro forma results include the effect of preliminary purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets, financing costs, and related income tax expense.  These adjustments are subject to change within the measurement period as our fair values assessments are finalized. The pro forma results do not reflect any material cost of integration activities or benefits that may result from synergies that may be derived from any integration activities. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the date indicated or which may occur in the future.

On

April 6, 2012

, we purchased the remaining

50%

ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, for

$90

million, which was funded from cash on hand.  We previously held a

50%

ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building.  This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition, which required that we re-measure our previously held

50%

ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations.  The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of

$81

million (

$51

million after-tax), which was recorded as a gain on business combination within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2013.

The total fair value of the net assets acquired was

$180

million, which was allocated as follows: building and improvements of

$113

million and land of

$58

million with the remainder allocated for settlement of our pre-existing lease and lease intangible assets.  The fair value of the building and improvements was determined based on current market replacement costs less depreciation and unamortized tenant improvement costs, as well as, other relevant market information, which are considered to be Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.  The building and improvements have a weighted average useful life of


years.  The fair value of the land was determined using comparable sales of land within the surrounding market, which is considered to be a Level 2 input.

Fiscal 2012

On

March 25, 2012

, we acquired substantially all of the assets of

Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. (“Katz Group”), and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group (collectively, “Katz Assets”)

for

$925

million, which was funded from cash on hand.

The acquisition of the assets from the Drug Trading Company Limited consists of a marketing and purchasing arm of independently owned pharmacies in Canada.  The acquisition of  Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc. consists of the franchise business of providing services to independent pharmacies in Canada.

Financial results for the acquired Katz Assets have been included in the results of operations within our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2013.

Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of

$442

million, the fair value of which was determined by applying the income approach, using several unobservable inputs for projected cash flows and a discount rate.

$318

million of service agreements and

$114

million of trademarks and trade names.  Service agreements, trademarks and trade names and total acquired intangibles assets each has an estimated weighted average life of


years.  The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately

$512

million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business.  The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is

$290

million.

During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments.  Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates.  Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

We incurred the following acquisition expenses and related adjustments:

The acquisition expenses and related adjustments by segment is as follows:

Acquisition expenses and related adjustments incurred in 2014 were primarily related to our acquisition of Celesio and the integration of PSS World Medical.  Related expenses for 2013 primarily pertained to our acquisition of PSS World Medical and our gain on business combination from our acquisition of  the remaining

50%

ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building, and for 2012  were primarily incurred to integrate a 2011 acquisition.  Additional acquisition-related expenses are expected to be incurred as we integrate our acquired businesses.

Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes.  For all acquisitions other than Celesio, the pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions,  and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis.

Discontinued Operations

In 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology and our Hospital Automation businesses from our Technology Solutions segment and certain businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment.  The results of operations and cash flows for these businesses are classified as discontinued operations for the years ended

March 31, 2014

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

During the third quarter of 2014, we recorded an

$80 million

pre-tax (

$80 million

after-tax) non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated net realizable value (fair value less costs to sell).  The charge was primarily the result of the terms of the preliminary purchase offers received for this business during the third quarter of 2014.  The impairment charge was primarily attributed to goodwill and other long-lived assets and as a result, there was no tax benefit associated with this charge.  The ultimate selling price of our International Technology business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of fair value.

During the third quarter of 2014, we sold our Hospital Automation business for net cash proceeds of

$55 million

and recorded a pre-tax and after-tax loss of

$5 million

and

$7 million

.

A summary of results of discontinued operations is as follows:

The assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations were classified as held-for-sale effective June 30, 2013.  All applicable assets of the businesses to be sold are included under the caption “Prepaid expenses and other” and all applicable liabilities under the caption “Other accrued liabilities” within our consolidated balance sheet at

March 31, 2014

Asset Impairments and Product Alignment Charges

In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded asset impairments and product alignment charges of

$57 million

,

$46

million and

$51

million  in our Technology Solutions segment.

Fiscal 2014

During the third quarter of 2014, our Technology Solutions segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling

$57 million

.  These charges primarily consist of

$35 million

of product alignment charges,

$15 million

of  integration-related expenses and

$7 million

of  reduction-in-workforce severance charges.  Included in the total charge was

$35 million

for severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and

$15 million

for asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs related to a product that will no longer be developed.  Charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows:

$34 million

in cost of sales and

$23 million

in operating expenses.

Fiscal 2013

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded

$46

million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges.  These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product.  The charge included a

$36

million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value.  In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis.  This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations.  Refer to Financial Note 19, “Fair Value Measurements,” for more information on this nonrecurring fair value measurement.  The balance of the charge represents a

$10

million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value.  We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value.  This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations.

Fiscal 2012

During the third quarter of 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our Technology Solutions segment.  As part of this alignment strategy, we began converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon’s Microsoft®-based platform.  Additionally, we stopped development of our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management™ (“HzERM”) software product.  The plan resulted in a pre-tax charge of

$51

$31

million was recorded to cost of sales and

$20

million was recorded to operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations.  The majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012.  The pre-tax charge included

$24

million of non-cash asset impairment charges, primarily for the write-off of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward,

$10

million for severance,

$7

million for customer allowances and

$10

Impairment and Sale of an Equity Investment

During 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our

49%

equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”) and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of

$191

million reducing the investment’s carrying value to its estimated fair value.  The charge reflected deterioration in Nadro’s market position, projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in Mexico.  Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of

$69

million were included in the assessment of the investment’s carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge.  Cumulative foreign currency translation losses (net of tax), were included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2013.  The impairment charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment.  Refer to Financial Note 19, “Fair Value Measurements,” for more information on this fair value measurement.

In September 2013, we completed the sale of our

49%

equity interest in Nadro which resulted in

no

material gain or loss.  Under the terms of the agreement, we received

$41

million in total cash consideration.  There was no material gain or loss on the disposition based on the adjusted net realizable value of the investment at the time of the sale.  Prior to the sale, our investment in Nadro was accounted for under the equity method of accounting within our Distribution Solutions segment.

Share-Based Compensation

We provide share-based compensation to our employees, officers and non-employee directors, including stock options, an employee stock purchase plan, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PeRSUs”) (collectively, “share-based awards”).  Most of our share-based awards are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year.

Compensation expense for the share-based awards is recognized for the portion of awards ultimately expected to vest.  We estimate the number of share-based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience.  The estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant is re-assessed throughout the requisite service period and is adjusted when actual forfeitures occur.  The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than current estimates.

The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees.  There was

no

material share-based compensation expense capitalized as part of the cost of an asset in


,


and

Impact on Net Income

The components of share-based compensation expense and related tax benefits are as follows:

(1)

This expense was primarily the result of PeRSUs awarded in prior years, which converted to RSUs due to the attainment of goals during the applicable years’ performance period.

(2)

Represents estimated compensation expense for PeRSUs that are conditional upon attaining performance objectives during the current year’s performance period.

(3)

Income tax benefit is computed using the tax rates of applicable tax jurisdictions.  Additionally, a portion of pre-tax compensation expense is not tax-deductible.

Stock Plans

In July 2013, our stockholders approved the 2013 Stock Plan to replace the 2005 Stock Plan.  These stock plans provide our employees, officers and non-employee directors the opportunity to receive equity-based, long-term incentives in the form of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PeRSUs and other share-based awards.  The 2013 Stock Plan reserves

30.0 million

shares plus the remaining number of shares reserved but unused under the 2005 Stock Plan.  As of March 31,


,

33.6

million shares remain available for future grant under the 2013 Stock Plan.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at no less than fair market value, and those options granted under the 2013 Stock Plan generally have a contractual term of

seven

years and follow a

four

-year vesting schedule.

Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and is based on the grant-date fair value for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest.  We use the Black-Scholes options-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options.  Once the fair value of an employee stock option is determined, current accounting practices do not permit it to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual.  The options-pricing model requires the use of various estimates and assumptions as follows:

•

Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied market volatility.  We believe that this market-based input provides a reasonable estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations.

•

Expected dividend yield is based on historical experience and investors’ current expectations.

•

The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant.

•

Expected life of the options is based primarily on historical employee stock option exercises and other behavior data and reflects the impact of changes in contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants.

Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options were as follows:

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

RSUs and PeRSUs

RSUs, which entitle the holder to receive at the end of a vesting term a specified number of shares of the Company’s common stock, are accounted for at fair value at the date of grant.  Total compensation expense for RSUs under our stock plans is determined by the product of the number of shares that are expected to vest and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock.  The Compensation Committee determines the vesting terms at the time of grant.  These awards generally vest in

three

to

four

years.  We recognize expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of RSUs, which vest immediately and are expensed upon grant.  The director may choose to receive payment immediately or defer receipt of the underlying shares if they meet director stock ownership guidelines.  At March 31,


,

150,000

RSUs for our directors are vested.

PeRSUs are RSUs for which the number of RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period.  PeRSUs are accounted for as variable awards until the performance goals are reached and the grant date is established.  Total compensation expense for PeRSUs is determined by the product of the number of shares eligible to be awarded and expected to vest, and the market price of the Company’s common stock, commencing at the inception of the requisite service period.  During the performance period, the compensation expense for PeRSUs is re-computed using the market price and the performance modifier at the end of a reporting period.  At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted and classified as RSUs and accounted for on that basis.  We recognize compensation expense of these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite aggregate service period of generally

four

years.

The following table summarizes RSU activity during


:

The following table provides data related to RSU activity:

In May 2013, the Compensation Committee approved


million PeRSU target share units representing the base number of awards that could be granted, if goals are attained, and would be granted in the first quarter of 2014 (the “


PeRSU”).  These target share units are not included in the table above as they have not been granted in the form of RSUs.  As of March 31,


, the total pre-tax compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested


PeRSUs not yet recognized was approximately

$121

million, (based on the period-end market price of the Company’s common stock) and the weighted-average period over which the cost is expected to be recognized is

three

years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

The Company has an ESPP under which


million shares have been authorized for issuance.  The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions.  The deductions occur over

three

-month purchase periods and the shares are then purchased at

85%

of the market price at the end of each purchase period.  Employees are allowed to terminate their participation in the ESPP at any time during the purchase period prior to the purchase of the shares.  The

15%

discount provided to employees on these shares is included in compensation expense.  The shares related to funds outstanding at the end of a quarter are included in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  These amounts have not been significant.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense related to continuing operations consists of the following:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Income tax expense included

$94

million of net discrete tax expense in


, and

$29

million and

$66

million of net discrete tax benefit in


and


.  Discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a

$122 million

charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. Included in the


discrete tax benefit is a

$31

million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit relating to our AWP litigation. The 2013 federal and state current income tax expense reflects the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.

We have received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of

$219 million

related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2009.  We previously appealed the reassessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2009.  On December 13, 2013, the Tax Court of Canada dismissed our appeal of the reassessment with respect to 2003.  On January 10, 2014, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal in response to the judgment of the Tax Court of Canada.  As a result of the unfavorable Tax Court Decision relating to 2003, we recognized a discrete tax expense of

$122 million

in the third quarter of 2014, which includes tax and interest, for the years 2003 through 2013.  The ultimate resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense.

We have received tax assessments of

$98 million

from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) relating to 2003 through 2006.  We are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process.  We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements.

The IRS is currently examining our U.S. corporation income tax returns for 2007 through 2009.  The CRA is currently examining our Canadian income tax returns for 2010 through 2013.   In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years prior to 2003 are no longer subject to examination.

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties.  Although our major taxing jurisdictions are the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid.  We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.

The reconciliation between our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and statutory tax rate is as follows:

At March 31,


undistributed earnings of our foreign operations totaling

$4.2

billion were considered to be permanently reinvested.

No

deferred tax liability has been recognized on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time.  The determination of the amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable because the computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a decision to repatriate the earnings is made.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Deferred tax balances consisted of the following:

We assess the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.  As a result of this assessment, valuation allowances have been recorded on certain deferred tax assets in various tax jurisdictions.  The increase in valuation allowances in the current year relate primarily to net operating losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized and deferred tax assets that were acquired as part of the Celesio acquisition which are not more likely than not to be realized.

We have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of

$53

million,

$2,524

million and

$935

million.  The federal and state net operating losses will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2034.  Substantially all of our foreign net operating losses have indefinite lives.  In addition, we have Canadian research and development credit carryforwards of

$11

million, and we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will be realized.  The Canadian research and development credits will expire at various dates from 2029 to 2034.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the last three years:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Of the total

$647

million in unrecognized tax benefits at March 31,


,

$490

million would reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate if recognized.  During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations could potentially reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by up to

$230

million.  However, this amount may change because we continue to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities throughout the year.

We report interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.  In 2014 and 2013, we recognized income tax expense of

$48

million and a reduction to income tax expense of

$8 million

, related to interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations.  The income tax expense for interest and penalties recognized in 2014 was primarily due to the additional interest resulting from the increase of our Canadian gross unrecognized tax benefits.  The reduction to income tax expense in 2013 was primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest resulting from the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.  At March 31,


and 2013, we had

$179

million and

$131 million

, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share attributable to McKesson are computed by dividing net income attributable to McKesson by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.  Diluted earnings per common share are computed similar to basic earnings per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

The computations for basic and diluted earnings per common share are as follows:

(1)

Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.

Potentially dilutive securities primarily include outstanding stock options, RSUs and PeRSUs.  Approximately

2 million

Debt and

Financing Activities

Information regarding long-term debt is as follows:

Senior Bridge Term Loan Facilities

In connection with our acquisition of Celesio, in January 2014, we entered into a

$5.5 billion


‑day unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (the “2014 Bridge Loan”) under terms substantially similar to those in our existing revolving credit facility.  On February 4, 2014, we borrowed

$4,957 million

under this facility, with such proceeds and cash on hand used to fund the acquisition of Celesio.  On March 10, 2014, we repaid

$4,076 million

of the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings with funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt.  On March 11, 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings using funds drawn on our Accounts Receivable Sales Facility and cash on hand.  On April 30, 2014, the commitments under the 2014 Bridge Loan automatically terminated upon the settlement of the tender offers for the remaining common shares of Celesio.  During the time it was outstanding, the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings bore interest at

1.39%

per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating.  Interest expense for 2014 included a total of

$46 million

of fees related to the 2014 Bridge Loan and a bridge loan agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2014 in anticipation of an earlier acquisition of Celesio.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical, in December 2012 we entered into a

$2.1

billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“2013 Bridge Loan”).  In February 2013, we reduced the 2013 Bridge Loan commitment to

$900

million.   On February 22, 2013, we borrowed

$900

million under the 2013 Bridge Loan, with such proceeds and cash on hand were used to redeem the assumed debt from PSS World Medical and pay the equity shareholders of PSS World Medical.  On March 8, 2013, we repaid the 2013 Bridge Loan borrowings with funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt and the bridge loan agreement was subsequently terminated.  During the time it was outstanding, the 2013 Bridge Loan borrowings bore interest at

1.20%

per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating.  Interest expense for 2013 included

$11

million of fees related to the 2013 Bridge Loan.

Celesio Debt

Upon the acquisition of Celesio, as required, we consolidated Celesio’s outstanding debt arrangements:

•

Accounts receivable factoring facility arrangements with a committed balance of

$308 million

. Transactions under these facilities are accounted for as secured borrowings with interest rates ranging

1.33%

to

2.31%

.  These facilities will expire through September 2015 and Celesio may renew certain facilities before their expiration.  Between February 7, 2014 and March 31, 2014, Celesio borrowed and repaid

$570 million

and

$575 million

under these facilities.  At March 31, 2014, there were

$246 million

in secured borrowings and related securitized accounts receivable outstanding under these facilities, which were included in short-term borrowings and receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.

•

Bilateral credit lines with a total committed balance of

$1,662 million

.  As of March 31, 2014, there were

$100 million

and

$88 million

in outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings with interest payable monthly and principal payments due through October 31, 2023.  The outstanding long-term borrowings are included in the caption “Bank liabilities and other” within the long-term debt table.  Bank liabilities also include Celesio’s

$100 million

term loan outstanding as of March 31, 2014, with a current variable interest rate of

2.35%

and principal repayments due through December 15, 2019.  Celesio also has a syndicated

€500 million

five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2018.  Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus an agreed margin.  From February 7, 2014 through March 31, 2014, there were

no

amounts outstanding under this credit facility.

•

Convertible bonds consisting of

1,857

of 2014 Bonds and

1,104

of 2018 Bonds held by third parties as of the Acquisition date, totaling

$344 million

as of the Acquisition date.  As previously disclosed in Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” these bonds were either converted to Celesio common shares or redeemed in cash between February 7, 2014 and March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2014, a total of

$5 million

According to certain terms and conditions of these bonds effective May 7, 2014  bondholders have the option to ask for repayment of the bonds at par value plus accrued interest.   If bondholders do not exercise this option by May 19, 2014, the bonds will remain outstanding until their respective maturity dates. Accordingly, as at March 31, 2014, these bonds have been classified as a current liability.   As of May 7, 2014, the fair value of these bonds of

$1,272 million

Each Series constitutes an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Company and ranks equally with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness outstanding from time-to-time.  Each Series is governed by materially similar indentures and officers’ certificate specifying certain terms of each Series.

With the exception of the Floating Rate Notes, upon


days notice to holders of a Series, we may redeem that Series at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, for cash at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium, as specified in the indenture and officers’ certificate relating to that Series.  In the event of the occurrence of both (1) a change of control of the Company and (2) a downgrade of a Series below an investment grade rating by each of Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services within a specified period, an offer must be made to purchase that Series from the holders at a price in cash equal to

101%

of the then outstanding principal amount of that Series, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase.  The indenture and the related officers’ certificate for each Series, subject to the exceptions and in compliance with the conditions as applicable, specify that we may not incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

Variable Interest Entities

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

We consolidate VIE’s when we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, as well as the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the entity, and as a result we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of these entities.  In addition to the consolidation of certain VIEs in our specialty health practices, as a result of our acquisition of Celesio, we have interests in seven new consolidated VIE’s.  These Celesio VIEs are single-lessee leasing entities in which Celesio as the lessee has the majority of the risk of the leased assets through the minimum lease payments owed by Celesio to the VIEs.  As a result of absorbing this risk, the leases provide Celesio with power over the operations of the leased properties as well as the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the entity.  Consolidated VIEs have an immaterial impact on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Total assets and liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet for these VIEs were

$160 million

and

$75 million

at March 31, 2014.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Investments in Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

We are involved with VIEs, which we do not consolidate because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities.  Our relationships include equity investments, lending, leasing, contractual or other relationships with the VIEs.  Our most significant relationships are with oncology and other specialty practices. Under these practice arrangements, we generally own or lease all of the real estate and the equipment used by the affiliated practices and manage the practices’ administrative functions.  As a result of our acquisition of Celesio, we also have relationships with certain pharmacies in Europe with whom we may provide financing, have equity ownership and/or a supply agreement whereby we supply the vast majority of the pharmacies’ purchases.  Our maximum exposure to loss (regardless of probability) as a result of all unconsolidated VIEs was

$1.2

billion and

$1.1

billion at March 31,


and


, which primarily represents the value of intangible assets related to service agreements and lease and loan receivables.  These amounts exclude the customer loan guarantees discussed in Financial Note 21, “Financial Guarantees and Warranties.”  We believe that there is no material loss exposure on these assets or from these relationships.

16.

Pension Benefits

We maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Eligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company as of December 31, 1995 are covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan.  In 1997, the plan was amended to freeze all plan benefits as of December 31, 1996.  Benefits for the defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at date of retirement, years of creditable service and the average of the highest

60 months

of pay during the

15 years

prior to the plan freeze date.  We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees outside of the U.S., as well as an unfunded nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plan for certain U.S. executives.  Most of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans cover employees located in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Celesio has defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees located predominately in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom.  Upon the acquisition of Celesio, as required, we consolidated Celesio’s pension assets and obligations on our consolidated balance sheet.  Benefits for these plans are based primarily on each employee’s final salary, with annual adjustments for inflation.  The obligations in Norway are largely related to the state-regulated pension plan which is managed by the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund (“SPK”).  According to the terms of the SPK, the plan assets of state regulated plans in Norway must correspond very closely to the pension obligation calculated using the principles codified in Norwegian law.  The shortfall may not exceed

1%

of the obligation. If the shortfall exceeds this threshold, it must be remedied within

2 years

.  In the United Kingdom, several Celesio subsidiaries participate in a joint pension plan.  This plan is largely funded by contractual trust arrangements that hold Company assets that may only be used to pay pension obligations.  The Trustee Board decides on the minimum contribution to the plan in association with selected employees of the entity.  A valuation is performed at regular intervals in order to determine the amount of the contribution and to ensure that the minimum contribution is made.  The pension obligation in Germany is unfunded with the exception of the contractual trust arrangement used to fund pensions of Celesio’s Management Board.

Defined benefit plan assets and obligations are measured as of the Company’s fiscal year-end.

Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the net periodic pension expense and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were as follows:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Our defined benefit pension plan liabilities are valued using a discount rate based on a yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated AA or better whose maturities are aligned with the expected benefit payments of our plans.  For March 31,

3.58%

, which represents an increase of


basis points from our


weighted-average discount rate of

3.40%

Sensitivity to changes in the weighted-average discount rate for our pension plans is as follows:

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

: The overall objective for U. S. pension plan assets is to generate long-term investment returns consistent with capital preservation and prudent investment practices, with a diversification of asset types and investment strategies.  Periodic adjustments are made to provide liquidity for benefit payments and to rebalance plan assets to their target allocations.

The target allocations for U.S. plan assets at March 31,


and 2013 are

50%

equity investments,

45%

fixed income investments including cash and cash equivalents and

5%

real estate.  Equity investments include common stock, preferred stock, and equity commingled funds.  Fixed income investments include corporate bonds, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, other directly held fixed income investments, and fixed income commingled funds.  The real estate investment is in a commingled real estate fund.

For both our and Celesio’s plan assets outside of the U.S., the investment strategies are subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country.  Plan assets of the non-U.S. plans are broadly invested in a manner appropriate to the nature and duration of the expected future retirement benefits payable under the plans. Plan assets are primarily invested in high-quality corporate and government bond funds and equity securities.  Assets are properly diversified to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset, issuer or group of undertakings so as to avoid accumulations of risk in the portfolio as a whole.

We develop the expected long-term rate of return assumption based on the projected performance of the asset classes in which plan assets are invested.  The target asset allocation was determined based on the liability and risk tolerance characteristics of the plans and at times may be adjusted to achieve overall investment objectives.

Fair Value Measurements:

The following tables represent our pension plan assets as of March 31,


and


, using the fair value hierarchy by asset class.  The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value.  Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

.

Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds that maintain daily liquidity and aim to have constant unit values of

$1.00

.  The funds invest in short-term fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and high credit quality.  Directly held cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments.  Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds and other commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.

Common and preferred stock - This investment class consists of common and preferred shares issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations.  Common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes are readily available.  Preferred shares may not be actively traded.  Holdings of common shares are generally classified as Level 1 investments.  Preferred shares are classified as Level 2 investments.

Equity commingled funds - Some equity investments are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.

Fixed income securities - Government securities consist of bonds and debentures issued by central governments or federal agencies; corporate bonds consist of bonds and debentures issued by corporations; mortgage-backed securities consist of debt obligations secured by a mortgage or pool of mortgages; and asset-backed securities primarily consist of debt obligations secured by an asset or pool of assets other than mortgages.  Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset.  Multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, enabling cross-provider price validations.  Fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.

Fixed income commingled funds - Some fixed income investments are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 2 investments.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Real estate funds - The value of the real estate funds is reported by the fund manager and is based on a valuation of the underlying properties.  Inputs used in the valuation include items such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.  The real estate funds are classified as Level 2 and Level 3 investments.

Other commingled funds - The other commingled funds are invested in equities, bonds, commodities, other alternative investments and cash and cash equivalents.  These funds are valued based on the weekly net asset values derived from the quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets and, for alternative investments, based on other valuation techniques.  Other commingled funds are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.

Other - At March 31, 2014, this includes

$46 million

of plan asset value relating to the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund (“SPK”). In principle, the SPK is organized as a pay-as-you-go system guaranteed by the Norwegian government as it holds no Company-owned assets to back the pension liabilities. The Company pays a pension premium used to fund the plan, which is paid directly to the Norwegian government and is accounted for as governmental income in the annual budget for Norway. To be able to report back plan asset values for the participating employers, SPK has established an annual account for each participating employer to keep track of the financial status of the plan, including managing the contributions and the payments. Further, the investment return credited to this account is determined annually by the SPK based on the performance of long-term government bonds.

The following table represents a reconciliation of Level 3 plan assets held during the years ended March 31,

Multiemployer Plans

The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees in the U.S.  In 2014, as a result of our acquisition of Celesio, we also contribute to the Pensjonsordningen for Apoteketaten (“POA”), a mandatory multiemployer pension scheme for our Pharmacy employees in Norway, managed by the association of Norwegian Pharmacies.

The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.  Actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of a multiemployer benefit plan and our withdrawal liability and contributions may increase.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Contributions and amounts accrued for U.S. Plans were not material for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.   Celesio’s  contributions to the POA exceeding

5%

of total plan contributions were

$5 million

since our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014.  Based on actuarial calculations, we estimate Celesio’s funded status to be less than

65%

as of March 31, 2014.

No

amounts were accrued for liability associated with the POA as Celesio has no intention to withdraw from the plan.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have a contributory profit sharing investment plan (“PSIP”) for U.S. employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Eligible employees may contribute to the PSIP up to

75%

of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis not to exceed IRS limits.  The Company makes matching contributions in an amount equal to

100%

of the employee’s first

3%

of pay contributed and

50%

for the next

2%

of pay contributed.  The Company also may make an additional annual matching contribution for each plan year to enable participants to receive a full match based on their annual contribution.  Contribution expenses for the PSIP were

Postretirement Benefits

We maintain a number of postretirement benefits, primarily consisting of healthcare and life insurance (“welfare”) benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees.  Eligible employees consist of those who retired before March 31, 1999 and those who retired after March 31, 1999, but were an active employee as of that date, after meeting other age-related criteria.  We also provide postretirement benefits for certain U.S. executives.  Defined benefit plan obligations are measured as of the Company’s fiscal year-end.

Hedging Activities

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations.  At times we limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.  In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes.  We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign currency rate risk

Prior to the acquisition of Celesio, the majority of our operations were conducted in U. S. dollars; however, certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and purchasing activities were incurred in and exposed to other currencies.  We have established certain foreign currency rate risk programs that manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuation.  These programs are utilized on a transactional basis when we consider there to be a risk in fair value or volatility in cash flows.  These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency rate risk.

Over the last three years, we have entered into forward contracts and a foreign currency option to hedge against cash flows denominated primarily in Canadian dollars and British pounds.  At March 31, 2014, forward contracts having a total notional value of

$463 million

were designated for hedge accounting.  These contracts will mature between March 2015 and March 2020. Changes in the fair values for contracts designated for hedge accounting were recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings; amounts recorded to earnings for these contracts were not material in 2014, 2013 and 2012.  Changes in the fair values for contracts not designated for hedge accounting were recorded directly to earnings; amounts recorded to earnings for these contracts were not material in 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Celesio has a number of forward contracts to hedge against cash flows denominated primarily in British pounds and other European currencies.  The contracts will mature from April 1, 2014 to January 2015. None of these contracts were designated for hedge accounting and accordingly, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings. At March 31, 2014, the total notional values of these contracts was

$1,091 million

. Amounts recorded to earnings were not material for 2014.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Interest rate risk

Celesio also has interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with Celesio’s variable rate debt. Interest rate swaps are used to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the variable rate debt to achieve primarily Euro dollar fixed rate interest expense. The interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of floating or fixed interest payments and have a gross notional of

$96 million

at March 31, 2014. The interest rate swaps will mature during the first half of 2015.  These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swaps were recorded directly in earnings.  Amounts recorded to earnings were not material for 2014.

Information regarding the fair value of derivatives on a gross basis is as follows:

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The analysis of fair value is conducted by our accounting and finance personnel who organizationally report to the Chief Financial Officer.  There is a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in determining fair value by their reliability and preferred use, as follows:

Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

At March 31,


and


, the carrying amounts of cash, certain cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, promissory notes and other current liabilities approximated their estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.

Our long-term debt and other financing arrangements are carried at amortized cost.  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these liabilities were

$10.4

billion and

$10.8

billion at March 31,


and

$4.9

billion and

$5.5

billion at March 31,


.  The estimated fair values of our long-term debt and other financing were determined using quoted market prices in a less active market and other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:

(1)  Gross unrealized gain and losses were not material for the years ended March 31,


and


.  Based on quoted prices of identical investments.

(2)  The carrying amounts of these cash equivalents approximated their estimated fair values because of their short maturities.

Fair values of our marketable securities were determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, which are considered Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.  Fair values for our marketable securities were not material at March 31, 2014 and 2013.

Fair values of our forward foreign currency derivatives were determined using quoted market prices of similar instruments in an active market and other observable inputs from available market information.  These inputs are considered Level 2 under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.  Refer to Financial Note 18, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our forward foreign currency derivatives.

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended March 31,


and

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

We measure certain long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, our intent to hold the investment, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the financial outlook for the industry and location.  An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the asset exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.

Fiscal 2014

Impairment of Our International Technology Business:

As discussed in Financial Note 3, “Discontinued Operations,” during 2014 we recorded an

$80 million

non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The impairment charge was primarily the result of the terms of the preliminary purchase offers received for this business during 2014.  Accordingly, the fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Fiscal 2013

For the year ended March 31,


, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of our investment in Nadro and goodwill for a reporting unit within our Technology Solutions segment.  Both of these assets were measured using Level 3 inputs.

Impairment of an Equity Investment:

As discussed in Financial Note 5, “Impairment and Sale of an Equity Investment,” during 2013 we committed to a plan to sell our investment in Nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded an impairment charge of

$191

million to reduce the carrying value to fair value.  Fair value of our investment in Nadro was determined using income and market valuation approaches.  Under the income approach, we used a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis based on estimated future results.  This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs related to the timing and amount of future cash flows based on projections of revenues and operating costs and discounting those cash flows to their present value.  The key inputs and assumptions of the DCF method are the projected cash flows, the terminal value of the business and the discount rate.  The key inputs for the market valuation approach were Nadro’s fiscal 2012 unaudited earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and an EBITDA multiple based on similar guideline U.S. pharmaceutical companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets.  This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.  Finally, we evaluated the fair values under both valuation methods and concluded on an average of the two methods.  In September 2013, we completed the sale of our

49%

interest in Nadro which resulted in

no

material gain or loss.

Goodwill:

As discussed in Financial Note 4, “Asset Impairments and Product Alignment Charges,” in 2013 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$36

million in one of Technology Solutions segment’s reporting units.  The impairment charge was primarily the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product.  As required under step two goodwill impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting units’ net assets, excluding goodwill but including any unrecognized intangible assets.  The implied fair value of goodwill was then calculated on a residual basis – that is, by subtracting the sum of the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit.  The impairment was equal to the carrying amount of goodwill.

Fair value assessment of the reporting unit as well as the reporting unit’s net assets are considered a Level 3 measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information.  We used the market approach and income approach (DCF model) to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and a DCF model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s most significant assets – intangibles.  Additionally, fair values reflect a risk premium to the discount rate due to the uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows.

Financial Guarantees and Warranties

Financial Guarantees

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions, mainly in Canada and Europe, under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory or our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions.  For our inventory repurchase agreements, among other requirements, inventories must be in resalable condition and any repurchase would be at a discount.  The inventory repurchase agreements mostly relate to certain Canadian customers and range from

one

to

two

years.  Customers’ debt guarantees range from

one

to

fifteen

years and are primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain customers.  The majority of our customers’ debt guarantees are secured by certain assets of the customer.  At March 31,


, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and customers’ debt guarantees were

$204

million and

$272

million, of which

$4 million

had been accrued.  The expirations of these financial guarantees are as follows:

$154

million,

$31

million,

$17

million,

$21

million and

$37 million

from


through


and

$216

million thereafter.

At March 31,


, our banks and insurance companies have issued

$161

million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.  Additionally, at March 31,


, we have a commitment to contribute up to

$40

million to a non-consolidated investment for building and equipment construction.

Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights.  To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnification agreements and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnification agreements (such as retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) whose terms vary in duration and often are not explicitly defined.  Where appropriate, obligations for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities.  Because the amounts of these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated.  Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have historically not made material payments as a result of these indemnification provisions.

Warranties

In the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and indemnification protection for our products and services.  For example, we provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products we distribute are in compliance with the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other applicable laws and regulations.  We have received the same warranties from our suppliers, which customarily are the manufacturers of the products.  In addition, we have indemnity obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been provided to us from our suppliers, either through express agreement or by operation of law.

We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and products we sell.  Our liability under these warranties is to bring the product into compliance with previously agreed upon specifications.  For software products, this may result in additional project costs, which are reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for software installation services within these contracts.  In addition, most of our customers who purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance agreements.  Revenues from these maintenance agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when claims become estimable.  Accrued warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.

22.

Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business.  As described below, many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and many seek an indeterminate amount of damages.

When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.  However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.  Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.  When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.

Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision.  We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made.  As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties.  Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.

We are party to the legal proceedings described below.  Unless otherwise stated, we are currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the unresolved proceedings described below.  Should any one or a combination of more than one of these proceedings be successful, or should we determine to settle any or a combination of these matters, we may be required to pay substantial sums, become subject to the entry of an injunction or be forced to change the manner in which we operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

I.  Litigation and Claims

On April 16, 2013, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Oncology, Inc. (“USON”), was served with a third amended

qui tam

complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by

two

relators, purportedly on behalf of the United States,

twenty-one

states and the District of Columbia, against USON and

five

other defendants, alleging that USON solicited and received illegal “kickbacks” from Amgen in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and various state false claims statutes, and seeking damages, treble damages, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts,

United States ex rel. Piacentile v. Amgen Inc., et al.

, (CV 04-3983 (SJ)).  Previously, the United States declined to intervene in the case as to all allegations and defendants except for Amgen.  On February 5, 2013, the United States filed a motion to dismiss the claims pled against Amgen.  On September 30, 2013, the court granted the United States’ motion to dismiss.  On April 4, 2014, USON filed a motion to dismiss the claims pled against it.  The court has not yet ruled on USON’s motion.

II.  Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) Litigation

On May 1, 2013, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by several Ohio health benefit programs against the Company asserting claims under the federal and Ohio RICO statutes, and seeking damages, treble damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts, based on the same allegations as the Company’s previously disclosed AWP litigation,

Ohio v. McKesson Corporation

, et al., (CV-13-2000-SI).  The plaintiffs allege that in late 2001, the Company and First DataBank, Inc., a publisher of pharmaceutical pricing information, conspired to improperly raise the published AWP for certain prescription drugs, and that this alleged conduct resulted in higher drug reimbursement payments.  On July 12, 2013, the parties filed a stipulation dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted against the Company under the Ohio RICO statutes.  On February 28, 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs.  On March 12, 2014, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties and the terms of the parties’ settlement agreement, the court entered an order dismissing this action with prejudice.

The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims.  Pre-tax charges relating to changes in the Company’s AWP litigation reserve, including accrued interest, are recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment.  The Company’s AWP litigation reserve is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following is the activity related to the AWP litigation reserve for the years ended March 31,


,


and


:

The charges for 2014 and 2013 primarily related to state Medicaid and other claims.  The charges for 2012 primarily related to the Douglas County, Kansas Action settlement and the state and federal Medicaid claims.

III. Government Subpoenas and Investigations

From time-to-time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies.  The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner.  These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company.  Such subpoenas and requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the health care industry, as well as to settlements.  Examples of such subpoenas and investigations include subpoenas commencing in 2013 from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to certain of the Company’s pharmaceutical distribution facilities seeking information and records about the Company’s distribution of certain controlled substances.  The Company is currently responding to these requests.  In addition, in the third quarter 2013, the Company was informed of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice through the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee.  The Company believes that the investigation is focused on distribution procedures with respect to the Vaccine for Children’s Program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In connection with the investigation, the Company has received and has responded to a subpoena seeking information and records from the Company’s Specialty Health business.  In the third quarter of 2014, the Company was informed of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice through the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of West Virginia of potential claims under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.  The Company believes that the investigation is focused on the Company’s pharmaceutical distribution of certain controlled substances by its Landover, Maryland distribution center, which closed in 2012.  In addition, in the fourth quarter 2014, the Company was informed of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice through the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  The Company believes that the investigation is focused on billing and coding services performed by our Technology business.  The Company is in the process of providing requested documents.

IV. Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of the Company’s former chemical businesses, which were fully divested by 1987, the Company is involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and regulations.  The Company has received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at

eight

sites where it, or entities acquired by it, formerly conducted operations and the Company, by administrative order or otherwise, has agreed to take certain actions at those sites, including soil and groundwater remediation.  In addition, the Company is one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United States Environmental Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages (“NRD”) associated with one of these

eight

sites.  Although the Company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at this time, it has agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) group in the funding of certain tasks to support an NRD assessment, the costs of which are reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below.

Based on a determination by the Company’s environmental staff, in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of the Company’s probable loss associated with the remediation costs for these

eight

sites is

$7

million, net of approximately

$1

million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or is expected, based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties.  The

$7

million is expected to be paid out between

May 2014

and

March 2034

.  The Company’s estimated probable loss for these environmental matters has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, the Company has been designated as a PRP under the Superfund law for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of its alleged disposal of hazardous substances at


sites.  With respect to these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter, costs of these sites are typically shared with other PRPs.  At one of these sites, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has selected a preferred remedy with an estimated cost of approximately

$70

million.  It is not certain at this point in time what proportion of this estimated liability will be borne by the Company or by the other PRPs.  Accordingly, the Company’s estimated probable loss at those


sites is approximately

$20

million, which has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  However, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserves.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

V.  Other Matters

The Company is involved in various other litigation and governmental proceedings, not described above, that arise in the normal course of business. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome or the duration of any such litigation or governmental proceedings, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and the advice of counsel, that such litigation and proceedings will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

23.

Stockholders’ Equity

Each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock is permitted one vote on proposals presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).

In July 2013, the quarterly dividend was raised from

$0.20

to

$0.24

per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board.  Dividends were

$0.92

per share in


and

$0.80

per share in


and


.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.  However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.

Share Repurchase Plans

Stock repurchases may be made from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods.  The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.

Information regarding the share repurchase activity over the last three years is as follows:

(1)

This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the exercise price in connection with cashless exercises of employee stock options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee equity awards.

(2)

All of the shares purchased were part of the publicly announced programs.

(3)

The number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately


million shares repurchased for

$217

million by the Company.   The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares.  We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.  As such,

$195

million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.

Other Comprehensive  Income (Loss)

Information regarding other comprehensive income (loss) including noncontrolling interest, net of tax by component are as follows:

(1)

The 2014 amounts include net foreign currency translation gain of

$21 million

attributable to noncontrolling interests.

(2)

As a result of our sale of our

49%

equity interest in Nadro, foreign currency translation net losses of

$44

million were reclassified from AOCI to other income, within our consolidated statement of operations.  Such losses were previously considered in our impairment evaluation of the investment when we committed to a plan to sell the investment during the fourth quarter of 2013, and accordingly did not impact earnings for 2014.

(3)

Pre-tax amount was reclassified into cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.  The related tax expense (benefit) was reclassified into income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Related Party Balances and Transactions

In April 2012, we purchased the remaining ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment.  As a result, there was

no

annual rental expense paid in 2014 and 2013.  We incurred

$10

million in 2012 of annual rental expense paid to this equity-held investment.

25.

Segments of Business

We report our operations in two operating segments:  McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions.  The factors for determining the reportable segments included the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the individual business activities.  We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including operating profit before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued operations.

The McKesson Distribution Solutions segment distributes ethical and proprietary drugs and equipment and health and beauty care products throughout North America and internationally.  This segment includes our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business which reflects the results of operations from our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014.  This segment also provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to oncology and other specialty practices operating in the community setting.  This segment also provides medical-surgical supply distribution, equipment, logistics and other services to healthcare providers through a network of distribution centers within the U.S.  In addition, this segment sells financial, operational and clinical solutions for pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing and other services.  In September 2013, we sold our

49%

interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”), a pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. Prior to the sale, financial results for Nadro were included in this segment.

The McKesson Technology Solutions segment includes McKesson Health Solutions, which includes our InterQual® clinical criteria solution, claims payment solutions and network performance tools.  This segment also delivers enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions, as well as connectivity, outsourcing and other services, including remote hosting and managed services, to healthcare organizations.  This segment’s customers include hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail pharmacies and payers primarily from North America.

Corporate includes expenses associated with Corporate functions and projects and the results of certain equity investments.  Corporate expenses are allocated to the operating segments to the extent that these items can be directly attributable to the segment.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Financial information relating to our reportable operating segments and reconciliations to the consolidated totals is as follows:

(1)

Revenues derived from services represent

less than 2%

of this segment’s total revenues.

(4)

5,000 options remain outstanding under the 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan.  No further awards will be made under this plan.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by the Company’s stockholders.  The plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, except for the portion of the 2013 Stock Plan and 2005 Stock Plan related to Non-Employee Directors, which is administered by the Board of Directors or its Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance.



McKESSON CORPORATION

2013 Stock Plan:

The 2013 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 22, 2013 and approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 31, 2013.  The 2013 Stock Plan permits the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock (“RS”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based restricted stock units (“PeRSUs”), performance shares and other share-based awards.  The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2013 Stock Plan equals the sum of (i) 30,000,000 shares, (ii) the number of shares reserved but unissued under the 2005 Stock Plan as of the effective date of the 2013 Stock Plan, and (iii) the number of shares that become available for reuse under the 2005 Stock Plan following the effective date of the 2013 Stock Plan.  For any one share of common stock issued in connection with an RS, RSU, PeRSU, performance share or other full share award, three and one-half (3.5) shares shall be deducted from the shares available for future grants.  Shares of common stock not issued or delivered as a result of the net exercise of a stock option, including in respect of the payment of applicable taxes, or shares repurchased on the open market with proceeds from the exercise of options shall not be returned to the reserve of shares available for issuance under the 2013 Stock Plan.  Shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations relating to the vesting of a full-share award shall be returned to the reserve of shares available for issuance under the 2013 Stock Plan.

Stock options are granted at no less than fair market value and those options granted under the 2013 Stock Plan generally have a contractual term of seven years.  Options generally become exercisable in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date.  The vesting of RS or RSUs is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.  RS and RSUs generally vest over four years.  PeRSUs vest three years following the end of the performance period.

Non-employee directors may be granted an award on the date of each annual meeting of the stockholders for up to 5,000 RSUs, as determined by the Board.  Such non-employee director award is fully vested on the date of the grant.

2005 Stock Plan:

The 2005 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 25, 2005 and approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 27, 2005.  The 2005 Stock Plan permits the granting of up to 42.5 million shares in the form of stock options, RS, RSUs, PeRSUs, performance shares and other share-based  awards.  For any one share of common stock issued in connection with an RS, RSU, performance share or other full-share award, two shares shall be deducted from the shares available for future grants.  Shares of common stock not issued or delivered as a result of the net exercise of a stock option, shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations relating to the vesting of a full-share award or shares repurchased on the open market with proceeds from the exercise of options shall not be returned to the reserve of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Stock Plan.

Following the effectiveness of the 2013 Stock Plan, no further shares were made subject to award under the 2005 Stock Plan.  Shares reserved but unissued under the 2005 Stock Plan as of the effective date of the 2013 Stock Plan, and shares that become available for reuse under the 2005 Stock Plan following the effectiveness of the 2013 Stock Plan, will be available for awards under the 2013 Stock Plan.

Stock options are granted at no less than fair market value and those options granted under the 2005 Stock Plan generally have a contractual term of seven years.  Prior to 2005, stock options typically had a contractual term of 10 years.  Options generally become exercisable in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date.  The vesting of RS or RSUs is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.  RS and RSUs generally vest over four years.  PeRSUs vest three years following the end of the performance period.

Non-employee directors may be granted an award on the date of each annual meeting of the stockholders for up to 5,000 RSUs, as determined by the Board.  Such non-employee director award is fully vested on the date of the grant.

1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan:

The 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 30, 1997; however, stockholder approval of the 2005 Stock Plan on July 27, 2005 had the effect of terminating the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan such that no new awards would be granted under the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”):

The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  In March 2002, the Board amended the ESPP to allow for participation in the plan by employees of certain of the Company’s international and other subsidiaries.  As to those employees, the ESPP does not qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Currently, 21.1 million shares have been approved by stockholders for issuance under the ESPP.

The ESPP is implemented through a continuous series of three-month purchase periods (“Purchase Periods”) during which contributions can be made toward the purchase of common stock under the plan.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Each eligible employee may elect to authorize regular payroll deductions during the next succeeding Purchase Period, the amount of which may not exceed 15% of a participant’s compensation.  At the end of each Purchase Period, the funds withheld by each participant will be used to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock.  The purchase price of each share of the Company’s common stock is based on 85% of the fair market value of each share on the last day of the applicable Purchase Period.  In general, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by a participant for each calendar year is determined by dividing $25,000 by the fair market value of one share of common stock on the offering date.

The following includes descriptions of equity plans that have not been submitted for approval by the Company’s stockholders:

On July 27, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2005 Stock Plan which had the effect of terminating the 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, the 1998 Canadian Stock Incentive Plan and certain 1999 one-time stock option plan awards, which plans had not been submitted for approval by the Company’s stockholders, and, as noted above, the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan, which had previously been approved by the Company’s stockholders.  Prior grants under these plans include stock options, RS and RSUs.  Stock options under the terminated plans generally have a ten-year life and vest over four years.  RS contains certain restrictions on transferability and may not be transferred until such restrictions lapse.  The 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan and the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan are the only terminated plans that have outstanding equity grants, which are subject to the terms and conditions of their respective plans, but no new grants will be made under these terminated plans.
