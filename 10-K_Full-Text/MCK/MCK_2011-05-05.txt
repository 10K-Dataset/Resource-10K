an analytical approach that emphasizes setting high-quality objectives, collecting data and
analyzing results to a fine degree in order to improve processes, reduce costs and minimize errors.

electronic health records (“EHR”). Analytics software enables organizations to measure progress as
they automate care processes for optimal clinical outcomes, business and operating results and
regulatory compliance. To ensure that organizations achieve the maximum value for their
information technology investment, we also offer a wide range of services to support the
implementation and use of solutions as well as assist with business and clinical redesign, process
re-engineering and staffing (both information technology and back-office).

Key solution areas are as follows:

Clinical and financial management:

We provide comprehensive clinical and financial
information systems for hospitals and health systems of all sizes. These systems are designed to
improve the safety and quality of patient care and improve clinical, financial and operational
performance. Clinical functionality includes a data repository, care planning, physician order
entry and documentation, nursing documentation with bar-coded medication administration,
laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, surgical management, emergency department and ambulatory EHR
systems, a Web-based physician portal and a comprehensive solution for homecare. Revenue management
solutions are designed to improve financial performance by reducing days in accounts receivable,
preventing insurance claim denials, reducing costs and improving productivity. Solutions include
online patient billing, contract management, electronic claims processing and coding compliance
checking. These solutions streamline patient access and help organizations to forecast financial
responsibility for constituents before and during care, allowing providers to collect their
reimbursements more quickly and at a lower cost.

Competition

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Distribution Solutions segment faces
strong competition, both in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line,
short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers
engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. In
addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from
pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the
segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply
management
capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. Price, quality of service, and
in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this
segment.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Our Technology Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms,
including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain
hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and
internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition varies
in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of
products and services offered.

We also own other registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and similar rights
used by our business segments. Many of the principal trademarks and service marks are registered
in the United States, or registrations have been applied for with respect to such marks, in
addition to certain other jurisdictions. The United States federal registrations of these
trademarks have terms of ten or twenty years, depending on date of registration, and are subject to
unlimited renewals. We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to preserve the registration
and duration of our trademarks and service marks, although no assurance can be given that we will
be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights thereunder in the event that they are subject
to third-party infringement claims. We do not consider any particular patent, license, franchise
or concession to be material to our business. We also hold copyrights in, and patents related to,
many of our products.

Other Information about the Business

Customers:

During 2011, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of
our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation
(“CVS”) and Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”), accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total
consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2011, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were
approximately 43% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. (“Walmart”) and Rite Aid were approximately 13%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable.
Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Distribution
Solutions segment.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Suppliers:

We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which
accounted for more than approximately 7% of our purchases in 2011. The loss of a supplier could
adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our
relationships with our suppliers on the whole are good. The ten largest suppliers in 2011
accounted for approximately 47% of our purchases.

A significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us
compensation based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution
arrangements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based compensation
component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing
inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and
magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us,
could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin.

Research and Development:

Our development expenditures primarily consist of our investment in
software held for sale. We spent $471 million, $451 million and $438 million for development
activities in 2011, 2010 and 2009 and of these amounts, we capitalized 14%, 17% and 17%.
Development expenditures are primarily incurred by our Technology Solutions segment. Our
Technology Solutions segment’s product development efforts apply computer technology and
installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other
customers. We believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is
important to the long-term success of this business. Additional information regarding our
development activities is included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the
consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental Regulation:

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal,
state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge
of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and
wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup
costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if
in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our
operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of
our business. We meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability
program.

We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain
environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states
may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are
described further in Financial Note 17, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the
consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the
Company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and
accruals, including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations, are presently not
material to our operations or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or
future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse
impact on our operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital
expenditures for environmental matters. Other than the expected expenditures that may be required
in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations, we do not anticipate making
substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with environmental
laws and regulations in the future. The amount of our capital expenditures for environmental
compliance was not material in 2011 and is not expected to be material in the next year.

Employees:

On March 31, 2011, we employed approximately 36,400 persons compared to 32,500 on
March 31, 2010 and 2009.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations:

Information as to foreign and
domestic operations is included in Financial Notes 1 and 20, “Significant Accounting Policies” and
“Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this report and the “Risk Factors” in
Item 1A of Part I of this report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Some of these statements can be identified by use of forward-looking words such
as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,”
“intends,” “plans” or “estimates,” or the negative of these words, or other comparable terminology.
The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans or intentions may also include forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied. Although it is not
possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not
limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A of Part I of this report under “Risk Factors.” The
reader should not consider the list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and
uncertainties.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described herein and in other information
contained in our publicly available SEC filings and press releases. Readers are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such
statements were first made. Except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake
no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements
to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.

Item 1A.   Risk Factors

The risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Although it is not possible to predict or
identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed below. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not
presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. The
reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.

We are subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial
position and results of operations.

From time-to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our
subsidiaries may become involved in various legal proceedings involving antitrust, commercial,
employment, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, tort and other various claims. All
such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive
verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into
settlements of claims for monetary damages. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or
punitive damages may be sought. For some complaints filed against the Company, we are currently
unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal
proceedings be resolved against the Company.

The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are
not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. The Company believes that it has valid
defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. Nevertheless,
it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result
in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. For example, we
are involved in a number of legal proceedings described in Financial Note 17, “Other Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements that could have
such an impact, including class actions and other legal proceedings alleging that we engaged in
illegal conduct that caused average wholesale prices to rise for certain prescription drugs during
specified periods.

Litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. The
defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management’s time and
attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. Even if these matters
are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal
proceedings could harm our business and reputation. For additional information regarding certain
of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Financial Note 17, “Other Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Changes in the United States healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the
healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the United States. In recent
years, the healthcare industry in the United States has changed significantly in an effort to
reduce costs. These changes have included increased use of managed care, cuts in Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply
distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the
healthcare industry in the United States to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models
to evolve in the future.

Changes in the healthcare industry’s or our pharmaceutical suppliers’ pricing, selling,
inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and
net income. Due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information
technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact
on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower
range of products and services.

The majority of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business’ agreements with manufacturers
are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we
provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner
could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, branded price
inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with
pharmaceutical manufacturers. If the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

In addition, we also distribute generic
pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase
over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents. In recent years,
our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings. An increase or a decrease in
the availability or changes in pricing  trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations.

Generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of
patents on branded pharmaceutical products. During the pendency of these legal challenges, a
generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product
prior to the final resolution to its legal challenge over the branded product’s patent. To the
extent we source and distribute such generic products launched “at risk,” the brand-name company
could assert infringement claims against us. While we generally obtain indemnification against
such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be
no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us.

In recent years, the pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation.
As a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market.
Accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and
therefore we may
be less able to negotiate price
terms with suppliers.

Many healthcare organizations also have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises
with greater market power. If this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the size of our
target market and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to
erosion of the prices for our products and services. In addition, when healthcare organizations
combine they often consolidate infrastructure including IT systems, which in turn may erode our
customer and revenue base.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution
businesses and computer-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively
impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or
implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the
Company to litigation and regulatory investigations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Healthcare Fraud:

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and
federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, and the federal government continues to
strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud affecting Medicare, Medicaid
and other government healthcare programs. Our relationships with pharmaceutical and
medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of
products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud
and abuse, which among other things (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or
paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing
the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid
or other government-sponsored healthcare programs, (2) impose a number of restrictions upon
referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid
programs, and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to a
federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many of the regulations applicable to
us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been
interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or
judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties,
including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal and state healthcare programs.

Reimbursements:

Both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be
adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals,
medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels
are determined. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care
and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the “Affordable Care Act”), signed into law in 2010,
revised the federal upper limits for Medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs
available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less
than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently
reported monthly average manufacturer price (“AMP”) using a smoothing process. In addition,
Medicare, Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (“SCHIP”) Extension Act of
2007 requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to adjust the calculation of
the Medicare Part B drug average sales price (“ASP”) to an actual sales volume basis. We expect
that the use of an AMP benchmark and the revised ASP calculations would result in a reduction in
the Medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals, which could
indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in
our profitability. There can be no assurance that these changes would not have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations.

Operating, Security and Licensure Standards:

We are subject to the operating and security
standards of the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), the Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (“HHS”), the CMS and other comparable agencies. Certain of our businesses may
be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security
standards of the DEA, FDA, HHS, CMS, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments
and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies,
depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.
As part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for
information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. Although we believe that we
are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no
assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning
the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there can be
no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other
regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other
approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws
and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Pedigree Tracking:

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government
agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and comparable government agencies, to regulate the
pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated
and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system (“pedigree tracking”). Certain
states have adopted or are considering laws and regulations that are intended to protect the
integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system, while other government agencies are currently
evaluating their recommendations. For example, Florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements
and California has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using radio frequency
tagging and electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in July 2016.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Final regulations under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act requiring pedigree and
chain of custody tracking in certain circumstances became effective December 1, 2006. This latter
regulation has been challenged in a case brought by secondary distributors. A preliminary
injunction was issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York that
temporarily enjoined implementation of this regulation. This injunction was affirmed by the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit in July 2008. In December 2008, both parties agreed to delay
this litigation, pending the outcome of certain U.S. congressional legislative initiatives. In
addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (“FDAA”), which went into effect
on October 1, 2007, requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective
technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs.
These standards may include any track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio
frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. On March 26, 2010, the FDA
released the Serialized Numerical Identifier (“SNI”) guidance for manufacturers who serialize
pharmaceutical packaging. We expect to be able to accommodate these SNI regulations in our
distribution operations. Nonetheless, these pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase
the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business,
and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Privacy:

State, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal
information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information
may be released. These regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and
patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified
privacy and security measures. Regulations currently in place, including regulations governing
electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to
apply. Although our policies, procedures and systems are being updated and modified to comply with
the current requirements of applicable state and foreign laws, including the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
(“ARRA”) of 2009, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our
customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or it could require us to incur
significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, the HITECH Act expanded
HIPAA privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. It also
extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as
a business associate of our payer and provider customers. These standards may be interpreted by a
regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations.
Furthermore, failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance
with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and
penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.

Health Care Reform

: The Affordable Care Act significantly expanded health insurance coverage
to uninsured Americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private
payers. Further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely. While we do not
currently anticipate that the Affordable Care Act will have a material impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations, given the scope of the changes made and the
uncertainties associated with the its implementation, we cannot predict its full impact on the
Company at this time.

Interoperability Standards:

There is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and
government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be
compatible with each other. This need for interoperability is leading to the development of
standards by various groups, and certain federal and state agencies are also developing standards
that could become mandatory for systems purchased by these agencies. For example, the HITECH Act
requires meaningful use of “certified” healthcare information technology products by healthcare
providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government. Effective September 27,
2010, CMS issued a rule that utilizes a staged approach for defining meaningful use criteria. In
“Stage 1,” CMS defined the initial criteria for meaningful use, and has stated that it intends to
update these initial criteria with additional “Stage 2” criteria by the end of calendar 2011, and
with additional “Stage 3” criteria by the end of calendar 2013. We may incur increased development
costs and delays in upgrading our customer software and systems to be in compliance with these
varying and evolving standards. In addition, these new standards may lengthen our sales and
implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of
revenue. To the extent these standards are narrowly construed or delayed in publication, or that
we are delayed in achieving certification under these evolving standards for applicable products,
our customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement our software and
systems.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FDA Regulation of Computer Products

: The FDA has increasingly focused on the regulation of
computer products and computer-assisted products as medical devices under the federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act. For example, effective April 18, 2011, the FDA issued a new rule regulating
certain computer data systems as medical devices. If the FDA chooses to regulate any of our
products as medical devices, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. If we fail to comply
with the applicable requirements, the FDA could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil
penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant
pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. Any
additional FDA regulations governing computer products, once issued, may increase the cost and time
to market new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products.

Standards for Submission of Health Care Claims

: HHS has adopted two new rules that impact
healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. In the first rule, effective January 1, 2012, HHS
has modified the standards for electronic health care transactions (

e.g.

, eligibility, claims
submission and payment and electronic remittance) from Version 4010/4010A to Version 5010. In the
second rule, effective October 1, 2013, HHS has updated and expanded the standard medical code sets
for diagnosis and procedure coding from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(“ICD-9”) to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (“ICD-10”). Updating systems
to Version 5010 is required for use of the ICD-10 code set. Generally, claims submitted not using
Version 5010 and ICD-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting
transactions using Version 5010 and ICD-10 may experience significant increases in customer service
inquiries. We may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and
upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new standards. In addition,
these standards may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods
prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. Delays in providing software and systems that
are in compliance with the new standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our
customers’ decisions to purchase our software and systems.

Claims Transmissions:

Medical billing and collection activities are governed by numerous
federal and state civil and criminal laws that pertain to companies that provide billing and
collection services, or that provide consulting services in connection with billing and collection
activities. In connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government
investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be
defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid
or other government-funded healthcare programs. Any such proceeding or investigation could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Changes in the Canadian healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations.

The provincial governments in Canada provide partial funding for the purchase of
pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. Similar to the
United States, the Canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in recent years
in an effort to reduce program costs. For example, in 2006 the Ontario government significantly
revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the Transparent Drug System for Patients
Act. In recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, various provinces  took further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic
drugs. These changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and,
in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional
allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. These reforms may adversely
affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the Company’s
operations in Canada. Other provinces are considering similar changes, which would also lower
pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. Individually or in combination, such changes in the
Canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our Canadian revenue and operating profit.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Competition may erode our profit.

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Distribution Solutions segment faces
strong competition, both in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line,
short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers
engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. In
addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from
pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the
segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply
management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. Price, quality of
service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive
elements in this segment.

Our Technology Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms,
including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain
hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and
internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition varies
in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of
products and services offered. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations.

A material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization,
as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization,
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity.

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of
large customers. During 2011, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51%
of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS and Rite Aid,
accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2011,
accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 43% of total accounts
receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Walmart and Rite Aid were approximately 13%, 10% and 9%
of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We
also have agreements with group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a
purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well
as with government entities and agencies. A material default in payment, change in our customer
mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

We generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in
nature and unsecured. Any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales
to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to
pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and
cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. Further, interest rate fluctuations
and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to
finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue
growth and cause a decrease in our profitability.

Contracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional
risks relating to future funding and compliance.

Contracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies are
subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by
various government authorities and profit and cost controls. Government contracts also are exposed
to uncertainties associated with funding. Contracts with the U.S. federal government, for example,
are subject to the uncertainties of Congressional funding. Governments are typically under no
obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be
eliminated. As a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or
decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. The loss of such contracts could
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

In addition, since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a
variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. For example,
for contracts with the U.S. federal government, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and the Cost Accounting Standards. We must also comply
with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to
employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. These regulations
and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose
additional costs on our business operations. Government contracts also contain terms that expose
us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts.

We also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. For example,
government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether
allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations. These audits can result
in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the
amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies.

If we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other
requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by the government
including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. In addition, any or all of our
government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government
contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. The occurrence of any of these actions
could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether
occurring in the United States or abroad.

Public health issues, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our
operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on
consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers.
We have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential
impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. However, there
can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any
such diseases on the Company’s operating results. We may be required to suspend operations in some
or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our Distribution Solutions segment is dependent upon sophisticated information systems. The
implementation delay, malfunction, or failure of these systems for any extended period of time
could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process,
analyze and manage data to (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory
items from numerous distribution centers, (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other
product and services on a timely basis, (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for
thousands of customers, and (4) process payments to suppliers. If these systems are interrupted,
damaged by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, or fail for any extended period of
time, we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

We could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance.

In order to provide prompt and complete service to our major Distribution Solutions segment’s
customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. While
we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can
be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. One
or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our
coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing,
dispensing of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services,
the conduct of our payer businesses (which include disease management programs and our nurse triage
services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient
medical histories and treatment plans. If customers assert liability claims against our products
and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost
to us, divert management’s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our
products. We attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of
liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from
liability for damages. Additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered
by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. We also maintain general liability coverage;
however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available
in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger
self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. In addition, the insurer might
disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful product or professional liability claim not
fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to
challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may
significantly reduce our results of operations.

Our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our Technology Solutions
segment, deliver enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic
management software solutions and pharmacy automation to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers,
retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. Challenges integrating software products could impair
our ability to attract and retain customers, and it could have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of
our Technology Solutions segment.

Future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies,
products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our
various businesses. Such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and
services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete.

The success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive
to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. To remain
competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses
must also develop new products on a timely basis. The failure to develop competitive products and
to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses
to attract and retain customers, and thereby it could have a material adverse impact on our results
of operations.

Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and products may be found to infringe the
rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure
and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our
products and solutions. There can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that
our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are equivalent or superior to our
technology. In addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our
technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. Although we believe that our
products do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time-to-time third parties
have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will
not assert infringement claims against us in the future. If we were found to be infringing others’
rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing
products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing
technology. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade
secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and
validity of the proprietary rights of others. These types of litigation can be costly and time
consuming. These litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products
or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

System errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen
liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations.

The software and software systems (“systems”) that we sell or operate are very complex. As
with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially when first
introduced. For example, our Technology Solutions segment’s business systems are intended to
provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our
systems have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. If our
software or systems lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to
claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. In addition, such failures could
damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales.

Failure of a client’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute
a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system
comply with the documentation. If such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could
constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain
refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages.

Various risks could interrupt customers’ access to their data residing in our service center,
exposing us to significant costs.

We provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software
of third-party vendors for our customers. The ability to access the systems and the data that we
host and support on demand is critical to our customers. Our operations and facilities are
vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our
control, including, without limitation (1) power loss and telecommunications failures, (2) fire,
flood, hurricane and other natural disasters, (3) software and hardware errors, failures or
crashes, and (4) computer viruses, hacking and similar disruptive problems. We attempt to mitigate
these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and
change control and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all
problems. If customers’ access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our
facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is
associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. We must maintain disaster
recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and
if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a
loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. Any
significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell
our remote hosting services.

The length of our sales and implementation cycles for our Technology Solutions segment could have a
material adverse impact on our future results of operations.

Many of the solutions offered by our Technology Solutions segment have long sales and
implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial
contact with the customer to completion of implementation. How and when to implement, replace, or
expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for
healthcare organizations. Many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital
expenditures and time commitments by the customer. Any decision by our customers to delay or
cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a
breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction
in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue.



McKESSON CORPORATION

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets
become impaired.

We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to test our
goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist.
Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected
operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or
economic trends or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization
for a sustained period of time. In addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying
value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates and the loss of a
significant customer. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our
consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or
intangible assets is determined. This could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations. There are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates, judgments and assumptions
used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. Any changes in key
assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or
other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates
and could potentially result in an impairment charge.

Our foreign operations may subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory
risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

We have operations based in foreign countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
other European countries and Israel and we have a large investment in Mexico. In the future, we
look to continue to grow our foreign operations both organically and through acquisitions and
investments; however, increasing our foreign operations carries additional risks. Operations
outside of the United States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies,
measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in
regulatory requirements for software, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific
country or region; import/export regulations in both the United States and foreign countries and
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Political changes and natural disasters,
some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our
activities in a particular location. Additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign
currency fluctuations that could adversely impact our results of operations based on the movements
of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper
payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar regulations in
foreign jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal
penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
operations.

We also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract
manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to (1) difficulties in complying
with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United
States and of foreign regulatory authorities, (2) inability to increase production capacity
commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand (3) other manufacturing or
distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing
capacity due to regulatory requirements or physical limitations that could impact continuous
supply, and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. Manufacturing
difficulties could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in
product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and
results of operations.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact
on our results of operations.

We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and
international jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United
States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From
time-to-time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax
positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by
these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as international,
tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we
believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws,
regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be
challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions
successfully.

An element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either
expand or complement our business. Since 2008, we have completed approximately $3 billion of
business acquisitions. Integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks,
including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of
businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the
realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of
the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including
internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers, including
physician affiliates, of the combined businesses. Further, acquisitions may have a material
adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to
occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of
certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed
litigation and unknown liabilities. In addition, we may potentially require additional financing
in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to
potential volatility in the credit markets. If we are unable to successfully complete and
integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could
be negatively affected.

Volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability
to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers.

Volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy
or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial
institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the
reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit
already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any
arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. Although we believe
that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets,
including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing
needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility
and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase
our costs of borrowing.

Our $1.35 billion accounts receivable sales facility is generally renewed annually and will
expire in May 2011. Although we did not use this facility in 2010 or 2011, we have
historically used it to fund working capital requirements, as needed. We anticipate renewing this
facility before its expiration. Although we believe we will be able to renew this facility, there
is no assurance that we will be able to do so.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience
disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.
As a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or
services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of
sale. Additionally, if customers’ or suppliers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates
or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to
pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit,
impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products
or incentives. Any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands
by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations and cash flow.

Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or
other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically
revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time-to-time we are required to adopt new or revised
accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. It
is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current
accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes
could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Item 1B.   Unresolved Staff Comments

Item 2.   Properties

Because of the nature of our principal businesses, our plant, warehousing, office and other
facilities are operated in widely dispersed locations, mostly throughout the U.S. and Canada. The
warehouses are typically owned or leased on a long-term basis. We consider our operating
properties to be in satisfactory condition and adequate to meet our needs for the next several
years without making capital expenditures materially higher than historical levels. Information as
to material lease commitments is included in Financial Note 15, “Lease Obligations,” to the
consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Financial Note 17, “Other

McKESSON CORPORATION

In October 2010, the Board approved a plan to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the
Company’s common stock of which $500 million remained available for future repurchases as of March
31, 2011. In March 2011, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program with a
third party financial institution to repurchase $275 million of the Company’s common stock. The
program was funded with cash on hand. As of March 31, 2011, we had received 3.1 million shares
representing the minimum number of shares due under the program. The ASR program was completed on
May 2, 2011 and we  received 0.4 million additional shares on May 5, 2011. The total
number of shares repurchased under the ASR program was 3.5 million shares at an average price per
share of $79.65. In addition, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $225 million during the
fourth quarter of 2011 through regular open market transactions at an average price per share of
$79.00. In April 2011, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of
the Company’s common stock.

Stock repurchases may be made from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately
negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, or by any combination of
such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will
depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements,
restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Item 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

GENERAL

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,
referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and
assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial
position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in
Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1
and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year
shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 —
Business — Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A — Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We conduct our business through two operating segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology
Solutions. See Financial Note 20, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements
appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these segments.

(1)

Includes pre-tax litigation charges (credit) of $213 million, $(20) million and $493
million for 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Revenues increased 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011 and 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010. The
increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which
accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. Additionally, revenues for 2011
benefited from our December 30, 2010 acquisition of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. (“US Oncology”) of
The Woodlands, Texas and revenues for 2010 benefited to a lesser extent from an increase in demand
related to the flu season. Partially offsetting the 2010 increases, revenues for that year were
affected by the loss of several customers in late 2009.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Gross profit increased 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011 and 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010. As a
percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 11 basis points (“bp”) to 5.33% and 18 bp to 5.22%
in 2011 and 2010. The increase in our 2011 gross profit margin was primarily due to an increase in
buy margin and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs in our Distribution Solutions
segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment
margin which included a $72 million asset impairment charge. The increase in our 2010 gross profit
margin was primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both our Distribution
Solutions and Technology Solutions segments.

Operating expenses were $4.1 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Operating expenses include pre-tax charges (credit) of $213 million, $(20) million and $493 million
relating to our securities and Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation matters. Excluding these
charges (credit), operating expenses increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher employee
compensation costs including expenses associated with our Profit Sharing Investment Plan (“PSIP”)
as well as due to our acquisition of US Oncology. Excluding these charges (credit), operating
expenses in 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower PSIP expenses and
the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009. These decreases were
partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit
costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. Our litigation charges
(credit) and PSIP expense are more fully described under the caption “Operating Expenses” in this
Financial Review.

Other income, net was $36 million, $43 million and $12 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In
2009, other income, net included a pre-tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after-tax)
on two equity-held investments and a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after tax) from the
sale of an equity-held investment.

Interest expense increased 19% to $222 million in 2011 and 30% to $187 million in 2010.
Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to bridge loan fees incurred for our acquisition
of US Oncology and interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing
of the debt. These increases were partially offset by the repayment of $215 million of
long-term debt in March 2010. Interest expense increased in 2010 primarily due to our issuance of
$700 million of long-term debt in February 2009.

Our reported income tax rates were 30.9%, 32.2% and 22.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2011,
income tax expense included $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which
primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest.
In 2009, current income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete
items of which $87 million represents a non-cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related
accrued interest.

Net income was $1,202 million, $1,263 million and $823 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, and
diluted earnings per common share were $4.57, $4.62, and $2.95. Diluted earnings per common share
were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the
cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years. Net income for 2011 includes a
$72 million after-tax gain (or $0.28 per diluted share) on the sale of our Technology Solutions
segment’s wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia Pacific Pty Limited (“MAP”), which was sold in
July 2010. Historical financial results for this subsidiary were not material.

Revenues increased 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011 and 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010. The
increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which
accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues.

Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to
market growth, which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers,
the effect of a shift from sales to customers’ warehouses to
direct store delivery, the lapsing of which was completed in the
third quarter of 2011,
 and due to our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by a decline
in demand associated with the flu season and price deflation associated with brand to generic drug
conversions. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily
due to a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery and market
growth, partially offset by greater sales of lower priced generic drugs and the loss of several
customers in late 2009. Revenues for 2010 benefited to a lesser extent from an increase in demand
associated with the flu season.

Sales to customers’ warehouses for 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting
reduced revenues associated with existing customers,  the effect of a shift of revenues to direct
store delivery,
the lapsing of which was
 completed in
the third quarter of 2011, and the impact of brand to generic conversions. Sales to customers’ warehouses for 2010 decreased compared to
2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, reduced revenues associated
with a large customer and the loss of a large customer in mid-2009, partially offset by expanded
business with existing customers.

Sales to retail customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals
primarily to a limited number of large self-warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order
bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central
distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as
received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers’ warehouses. This distribution method is
typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand-alone service; rather, it is offered as an
additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal
self-warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers’ warehouses provide a benefit to these
customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct-to-store
business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins
on sales to customers’ warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost-to-serve model
on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars.

As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase
products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally
has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost-to-serve model. When evaluating
and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability.
As a result, we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers’
warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales.

Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2011 increased compared to 2010
primarily due to a change in the foreign currency exchange rate of 7%. On a constant currency
basis, revenues increased 1% in 2011. Canadian revenues for 2011 increased due to market growth,
offset by a government-imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and
brand to generic conversions. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2010
increased compared to 2009 primarily due to market growth and a favorable change in the foreign
currency exchange rate of 3%. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased by 7% in 2010.

Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010
primarily due to market growth, partially offset by the decrease in demand associated with the flu
season. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009
reflecting an increase in demand related to the flu season, acquisitions and increased volume from
new and existing customers.

Technology Solutions revenues increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to
an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers,
increased revenues associated with the
sale and installation of our software products and growth in our outsourcing services, partially
offset by the sale of MAP in July 2010. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2010 compared
to 2009 primarily due to higher services revenues associated with increases in outsourcing revenues
for claims processing and other services and software maintenance reflecting the segment’s expanded
customer base. These increases were partially offset by a shift to products that have higher
software revenue deferral rates and lower hardware sales.

Gross profit of our Distribution Solutions segment for 2011 includes a credit of $51

against a drug manufacturer, which was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.

(2)

Gross profit of our Technology Solutions segment for 2011 includes a $72 million asset
impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale.

Gross profit increased 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011 and 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010. As a
percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 11 bp in 2011 and 18 bp in 2010. Gross profit
margin increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margin from our Distribution
Solutions segment and increased in 2010  primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin
revenues in both of our operating segments.

In 2011, our Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2010
primarily reflecting higher buy margin, increased sales of higher margin generic drugs and due to
our acquisition of US Oncology, partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu
season and a decrease in sell margin. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of
compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our Distribution Solutions segment’s 2011
gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a credit of $51 million representing our share
of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit.

In 2010, our Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2009
primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin
revenues stemming from increased flu-related demand across our distribution businesses. Gross
profit margin was also favorably affected by a higher buy margin and increased sales of higher
margin generic drugs. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in sell margin.

Our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) net inventory expense was $3 million in 2011 and $8 million
for 2010 and 2009. Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the
majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement
cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions segment’s
distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers.
Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory
losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few
years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories, which resulted in
minimal overall price changes in those years. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting
is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this
Financial Review.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2011, our Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin decreased compared to 2010
primarily due to a $72 million asset impairment charge, the sale of MAP and continued investment in
our clinical and enterprise revenue management solutions products. These decreases were partially
offset by a shift to higher margin revenue. In 2010, our Technology Solutions segment’s gross
profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to a favorable change in revenue mix,
partially offset by a higher software revenue deferral rate.

Our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years. At each balance sheet
date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of
unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of
estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. In October 2010, we decreased our
estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our Horizon Enterprise Revenue
Management

TM

(“HzERM”) software product and as a result, concluded that the estimated
future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value.
Accordingly, we recorded a $72 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011
within our Technology Solutions segment’s cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the
software product to its net realizable value.

Operating expenses for 2011 and 2009 include $213 million and $493 million of AWP
litigation charges.

Operating expenses increased 13% to $4.1 billion in 2011 and decreased 12% to $3.7
billion in 2010. Excluding the 2011, 2010 and 2009 litigation charges (credit) of $213 million,
$(20) million and $493 million, operating expenses increased 7% in 2011 and remained flat in 2010.
Excluding the litigation charges (credit), operating expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010
primarily due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including the
McKesson Corporation Profit Sharing Investment Plan (“PSIP”) and the addition of US Oncology.

Excluding the litigation charges (credit), operating expenses for 2010 approximated 2009
primarily due to lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and the sale of two businesses during
2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee
compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives.

The McKesson Corporation PSIP was a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated
Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the
distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119
million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of
the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP
participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and were
allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately
$77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the “Unallocated
Proceeds”) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”)
suspense account. In accordance with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated
Proceeds to current PSIP participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt
of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Company’s
common stock held by the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities
Litigation Action class-holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP
or ESOP.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Company’s financial statements
relating to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP.

As a result of the PSIP’s receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds, in 2010 the Company contributed
$1 million to the PSIP. Accordingly, PSIP expense for 2010 was nominal. In 2011, the Company
resumed its contributions to the PSIP.

PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows:

Amounts recorded to cost of sales pertain solely to our McKesson Technology Solutions

On a segment basis, Distribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses increased in 2011
and decreased in 2010 primarily due to the AWP litigation charges of $213 million and $493 million
in 2011 and 2009. Excluding the AWP charge, operating expenses and operating expenses as a
percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher costs associated
with employee compensation and benefits including PSIP expenses and the addition of US Oncology.
Operating expenses in 2011 also increased as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.

Excluding the AWP charge, Distribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating
expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the sale
of two businesses during 2009, lower PSIP expense in 2010 and our continued focus on cost
containment. These decreases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with our 2009
business acquisitions.

As previously reported, in 2009 we reached an agreement to settle all private party claims
relating to First DataBank, Inc.’s published drug reimbursement benchmarks for $350 million. We
also recorded an accrual of $143 million for pending and expected AWP claims by public payers. The
combination of the settlement for all AWP private party claims and the decision by us to establish
an estimated accrual for the pending and expected AWP claims by public payers resulted in a
pre-tax, non-cash charge of $493 million in the third quarter of 2009. In the second quarter of
2011, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $24 million for the settlement with the State of Connecticut
relating to AWP claims. The settlement included an express denial of liability and a release by
Connecticut of the Company as to all matters alleged or which could have been alleged in the
action. A cash payment of $26 million was made in the third quarter of 2011 for this settlement.
During the third quarter of 2011, following a review of the reserve for estimated probable losses
from current and possible future public entity AWP claims, which review included consideration of
the pace and progress of settlement discussions during and after the third quarter relating to
state and federal Medicaid claims, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $189 million. All AWP
litigation charges were included in our Distribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses. As of
March 31, 2011, the reserve relating to AWP public entity claims was $330 million and was included
in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 17, “Other
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

We anticipate incurring additional acquisition-related expenses in 2012 as we continue to

Technology Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of
revenues increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010. The growth in 2011 reflects our increased
investment in research and development activities and higher employee compensation and benefit
costs, which includes PSIP expense, partially offset by the sale of MAP in the second quarter of
2011. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 benefited
from lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and reduction in workforce plans implemented in
2009, partially offset by our continued investment in research and development activities.

Corporate expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher compensation
and benefits costs and an asset impairment charge for certain tangible property, partially offset
by lower fees associated with our accounts receivable facility. As a result of our adoption of a
new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets on April 1, 2010, fees associated with
our accounts receivable sales facility are now recorded in interest expense. Prior to
2011, these fees were recorded in Corporate administrative expenses. Corporate expenses for 2010
increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs, other business
initiatives and legal settlement charges.

In 2010, we recorded net credits of $20 million relating to settlements for the securities
litigation, which were recorded in Corporate expenses.

In 2011, other income, net included a credit of $16 million representing the reimbursement of

Corporate. Interest income was $18 million, $16 million and $31 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

In 2010, other income, net included a $17 million pre-tax gain ($14 million after-tax) from
the sale of our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions, LLC (“MLS”). The gain on sale
of our investment in MLS was recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. This increase was
partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2009, other income, net included a pre-tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million
after-tax) on two equity-held investments (as further described below) and a pre-tax gain of $24
million ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of our 42% equity interest in Verispan, LLC
(“Verispan”). The impairment charge and the gain on sale of our investment in Verispan were both
recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying values of such investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in
value. In 2009, we determined that the fair value of our interest in Parata Systems, LLC
(“Parata”) was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was other-than-temporary.
Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results
and market capitalization rates. We determined the impairment was other-than-temporary based on
our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investee’s financial
condition and weak market conditions. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax impairment of $58 million
($55 million after-tax) on this investment which is recorded as other income, net in the
consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. Our investment in
Parata is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

In 2009, we also recorded a pre-tax impairment of $5 million ($5 million after-tax) on another
equity-held investment within our Distribution Solutions segment.

$51 million antitrust settlement.

Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased in 2010 compared to

Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010
primarily reflecting a decrease in gross profit margin, which included the $72 million asset
impairment charge and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating
profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due
to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and an improvement in gross profit margin.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Corporate expenses, net of other income were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an
increase in operating expenses which were fully offset by an increase in other income, including
the $16 million benefit associated with the reimbursement of post-acquisition interest expense by
the former shareholders of US Oncology. Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2010
compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in interest
income.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to $25
million of bridge loan fees related to the acquisition of US Oncology, interest expense associated
with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt and fees from our accounts
receivable sales facility which are recorded in interest expense commencing in 2011.
These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of $215
million of our long-term debt in March 2010. Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009
primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long-term debt in February 2009. Refer to our
discussion under the caption “Credit Resources” within this Financial Review for additional
information regarding our financing activities.

Income Taxes:

Our reported tax rates were 30.9%, 32.2% and 22.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In
addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to
changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign
countries that have lower income tax rates.

In
2011, income tax expense included $34 million of net income tax
benefits for discrete items,
which primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued
interest.

In 2009, income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete
items of which $87 million represents a non-cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition
of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations.

The
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently examining our fiscal
years 2003 through 2006 and we anticipate the field work will be completed and they will issue the Revenue Agent Report in our first quarter of fiscal 2012.
We have received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency
(“CRA”) for a total of $169 million
related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2007. Payments of most
of the assessments to the CRA have
been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003
to the Tax Court of Canada
 and have filed
a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007.  If we
are not successful in resolving these issues with the CRA, a trial date has been set for October 17, 2011 with
the Tax Court of Canada. We believe that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse
results relating to the IRS and CRA examinations. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in
an increase or decrease to income tax expense.

Discontinued Operation:

In July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold MAP, a provider
of phone and web-based healthcare services in Australia and New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of
$109 million. The divestiture generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $95 million and $72
million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize capital loss carry-forwards for which we
previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million. The release of the valuation allowance
is included as a tax benefit in our after-tax gain on the divestiture. The after-tax gain on
disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations in 2011. The
historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP were not material to our consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented

.

Net Income:

Net income was $1,202 million, $1,263 million and $823 million in 2011, 2010 and
2009 and diluted earnings per common share were $4.57, $4.62 and $2.95. The net income and diluted
earnings per common share for 2011 included a pre-tax charge of $213 million ($149 million
after-tax). Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 also included an after-tax
gain of $72 million (or $0.28 per diluted share) relating to our sale of MAP. The net income and
diluted earnings per common share for 2009 included a pre-tax charge of $493 million ($311 million
after-tax) for the AWP litigation.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding:

Diluted earnings per common share was
calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 263 million, 273 million and
279 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009. The decrease in the number of weighted average diluted common
shares outstanding over the past two years primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares
outstanding as a result of stock repurchased, partially offset by the exercise/settlement of
share-based awards.

International Operations

International operations accounted for 8.9%, 8.6% and 7.9% of 2011, 2010 and 2009 consolidated
revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations.
We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political
environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our
international operations is also included in Financial Note 20, “Segments of Business,” to the
consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Business Combinations

On December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology for
approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of cash consideration of $0.2 billion, net of cash acquired,
and the assumption of liabilities with a fair value of $1.9 billion. As an integrated oncology
company, US Oncology is affiliated with community-based oncologists, and works with patients,
hospitals, payers and the medical industry across all phases of the cancer research and delivery
continuum. The acquisition of US Oncology expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical
distribution business and adds practice management services for oncologists. The cash paid at
acquisition was funded from cash on hand.

Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $1.0
billion, which primarily consist of $0.7 billion of service agreements and $0.2 billion of customer
lists. The estimated weighted average lives of the service agreements, customer lists and total
acquired intangibles are 18 years, 10 years and 16 years. The excess of the purchase price over
the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $808 million was recorded as goodwill,
which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business.
Due to the recent timing of the acquisition, the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date are
subject to change within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized.
Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our
Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011.

On May 21, 2008, we acquired McQueary Brothers of Springfield, Missouri for approximately $190
million. McQueary Brothers is a regional distributor of pharmaceutical, health and beauty products
to independent and regional chain pharmacies in the Midwestern U.S. This acquisition expanded our
existing U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand.
Financial results for McQueary Brothers have been included within our Distribution Solutions
segment since the date of acquisition. During the first quarter of 2010, the fair value
measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were completed.
The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $126
million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflected the expected future benefits from
synergies to be realized upon integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation
were acquired identifiable intangibles of $61 million primarily representing a customer
relationship with a useful life of 7 years, a trade name of $2 million with a useful life of less
than one year and a not-to-compete agreement of $4 million with a useful life of 4 years.

During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within
both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included
in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices
for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make
assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if
different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the
accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a
material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates
that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition.
Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to
the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the
uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

We provide short-term credit and other customer financing
arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing
primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the
repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase
of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we
do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding
the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial
statements for these amounts.

In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and
specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer
financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the
probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our
customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for
uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding
receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be
in doubt. During 2011, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our
total consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”)
and Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”), accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total
consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2011, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were
approximately 43% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. (“Walmart”) and Rite Aid were approximately 13%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. As
a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material
reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity.

Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business
and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual
circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in
2011 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are
not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in
the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue.

At March 31, 2011, trade and notes receivables were $8,108 million prior to allowances of $124
million. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 our provision for bad debts was $18 million, $17 million and $29
million. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables
was 1.5% and 1.8%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2011 allowance as a
percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision
for bad debts of approximately $8 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect
what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our
allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Inventories:

We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for
our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution
Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO
method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”)
method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined
by the standard cost method. Rebates, fees, cash discounts, allowances, chargebacks and other
incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of
inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $9.2 billion and
$9.4 billion at March 31, 2011 and 2010.

The LIFO method was used to value approximately 87% of our inventories at March 31, 2011 and
2010. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $96 million and
$93 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2011,
2010, and 2009, we recognized net LIFO expense of $3 million, $8 million and $8 million within our
consolidated statements of operations. In 2011, our $3 million net LIFO expense related to our
non-pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases
on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of
price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded
pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the
net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price
increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.

We believe that the FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the
current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the
lower of LIFO or inventory as valued under FIFO. Primarily due to continued net deflation in
generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at
LIFO were $156 million and $112
million higher than FIFO as of March 31, 2011 and 2010. As a result, in 2011 and 2010, we recorded
LCM charges of $44 million and $5 million within our consolidated statements of operations to
adjust our LIFO inventories to market. As deflation in generic pharmaceuticals continues, we
anticipate that LIFO credits from the valuation of our pharmaceutical products will be fully offset
by LCM reserves.

In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including
estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase
obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer
preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of
one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We
provide reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, if indicated, as a result of these reviews.
These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.

Business Combinations:

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of
accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date
of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Effective April 1, 2009,
acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business
combinations and are expensed as incurred. Acquisition-related expenses totaled $52 million in 2011
and were not material in 2010.

Several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a
forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset or liability acquired. These
cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that
reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant
estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and
timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in
the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends
impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic
barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as
different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even
be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,”
to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information regarding our acquisitions.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Goodwill:

As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $4,364 million and $3,568 million of
goodwill at March 31, 2011 and 2010. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets
are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the
fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that
are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results,
significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or
a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained
period of time.

Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a
component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating
segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly
reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations,
products, services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is
involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could
affect the outcome of the testing.

Impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the
estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units. If the carrying value exceeds the fair
value, a second step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment, which would be
recorded as a charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Fair values can be determined
using the market, income or cost approach. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we
use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we
estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose
securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted
cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the
end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of
return. In addition, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market
capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value.

Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment
estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline
companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the
reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in
marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the
required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market
conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both
the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings
and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units.

Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The judgments made
in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The
valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on
expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key
assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or
other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates
and could potentially result in an impairment charge.

In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair
value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

Supplier Incentives:

Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating
to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of
goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a
result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of
goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Supplier Reserves:

We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to
various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments
otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering
the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific
incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from
suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes
in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, supplier reserves were $102 million and
$89 million. The ultimate outcome of any amounts due from our suppliers may be different from our
estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2011 and 2010 pertain to our Distribution
Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade
payables at March 31, 2011 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of
approximately $14 million in 2011. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what
could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.

Income Taxes:

Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect
management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to
income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates
are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax
uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as
new information becomes available.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement
recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets,
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the
existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future
taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount
of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary
differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These
assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are
consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had
deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,297 million and $1,187 million at
March 31, 2011 and 2010 and deferred tax liabilities of $2,261 million and $1,845 million.
Deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences
on our compensation and benefit related accruals. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of
basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets.
We established valuation allowances of $99 million against certain deferred tax assets, which
primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate
realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect
recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including
those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted.

If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in
our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have
increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $16 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for 2011.

Share-Based Compensation:

Our compensation programs include share-based compensation. We
account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method.
The share-based compensation expense is recognized, for the portion of the awards that is
ultimately expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for those
awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards with performance conditions and
multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis. For awards with
performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on a straight-line basis.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We estimate the grant-date fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes
options-pricing model. We believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an
employee stock option. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors
we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. The key
factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected life of the option, the
expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield. In determining the
expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future
exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine
the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that this market-based input provides a
better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option
valuation considerations. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, current
accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different
from actual experience.

In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards, which will ultimately
vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a
material effect on share-based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than
the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture
rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If
the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made
to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense
recognized in the financial statements. We re-assess the estimated forfeiture rate established
upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. Such estimates are revised if
they differ materially from actual forfeitures. As required, the forfeiture estimates will be
adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future
reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates.

Our assessments of estimated share-based compensation charges are affected by our stock price
as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax
impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise
behavior, timing, number and types of annual share-based awards and the attainment of performance
goals. As a result, the future share-based compensation expense may differ from the Company’s
historical amounts.

Loss Contingencies:

We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters
arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and
reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate
loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often
difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not
be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and
decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.
Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time
relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both
the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of
possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the
proceeding is provided.

Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or
when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We
review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed
and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As
discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is
complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties,
such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear
directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries
of high and low estimate.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of
liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and short-term borrowings under the revolving
credit facility and commercial paper, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term
capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, from time-to-time,
we may access the long-term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Net
cash flow from operating activities was $2,338 million in 2011 compared to $2,316 million
in 2010 and $1,351 million in 2009. Operating activities for 2011 included a non-cash charge of
$213 million and the related income tax benefit of $64 million for the AWP litigation charge.
Operating activities for 2011 also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with
revenue growth, partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for
certain purchases. Cash flows from operations can also be significantly affected by factors such
as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors.

Operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and
accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the
AWP litigation private payer settlement payments of $350 million.

Operating activities for 2009 included a non-cash charge of $493 million and the related
income tax benefit of $182 million for the AWP litigation charge. Operating activities for 2009
also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth as well as
longer payment terms for certain customers and improvement in our net financial inventory
(inventory, net of drafts and accounts payable).

Net cash used in investing activities was $624 million in 2011 compared to $309 million in
2010 and $727 million in 2009. Investing activities for 2011 included $292 million of cash
payments for business acquisitions, including approximately $244 million for our acquisition of US
Oncology, and $109 million of cash received from the sale of MAP. Investing activities in 2011 also
included $233 million and $155 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and
capitalized software. Investing activities for 2010 included $199 million and $179 million in
capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of $55
million of restricted cash from escrow related to the AWP private litigation settlement payments.
Investing activities for 2009 included $358 million of cash payments for business acquisitions,
including the McQueary Brothers acquisition for approximately $190 million.

Financing
activities utilized cash of $1,841 million in 2011 and $421 million in 2010, and
provided cash of $178 million in 2009. Financing activities for 2011 reflect $1,689 million of
cash received from the issuance of long-term debt. In February 2011 we issued $600 million of
3.25% notes due 2016, $600 million of 4.75% notes due 2021, and $500 million of 6.00% notes due
2041. Net proceeds from the issuance of the long-term notes, after
discounts and offering expenses,
were used to pay off the $1,730 million of debt assumed as part of the acquisition of US Oncology.
Also as part of our acquisition of US Oncology, we borrowed $1,000 million for bridge financing
which was fully repaid by February 2011. Financing activities for 2011 also included $2,050
million of cash paid for share repurchases, $171 million of dividends paid and $367 million of cash
receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options.

Financing activities for 2010 included $323 million in cash paid for share repurchases and
$218 million in cash paid on our long-term debt, which primarily consisted of $215 million paid on
the maturity of our 9.13% Series C Senior Notes in March 2010. Financing activities for 2010 also
included $323 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $131 million of dividends paid and $212
million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options.

Financing activities for 2009 included our February 2009 issuance of $350 million of 6.50%
notes due 2014 and $350 million of 7.50% notes due 2019. Net proceeds of $693 million from the
issuance of the notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used by the Company for general
corporate purposes. Financing activities for 2009 also included $502 million of cash paid for
share repurchases, $116 million of dividends paid and $97 million of cash receipts from employees’
exercises of stock options.

The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time
in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share
repurchase programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the
actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price,
corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and
economic conditions. As of March 31, 2011, $500 million remained available for future repurchases
under the October 2010 Board approved share repurchase plan. In
April 2011, the Board authorized
the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In July 2008, the Board authorized the retirement of shares of the Company’s common stock that
may be repurchased from time-to-time pursuant to its stock repurchase program. During the second
quarter of 2009, all of the 4 million repurchased shares, which we purchased for $204 million, were
formally retired by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We
elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in
capital and retained earnings. As such, $165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained
earnings.

The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.
However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and
will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other
factors.

Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital
and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to
meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or
increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our
liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

Our
cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2011, included approximately $1.8
billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our intent is to
utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and
development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash
held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to
U.S. federal, state and local income tax. During the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant
to IRS regulations, we temporarily borrowed and repaid $1.0 billion of cash held by our
subsidiaries outside the United States. The duration of this temporary loan to the United
States was less than 60 days.

Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories, net
of drafts and accounts payable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution
Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large
variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.
Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and customer requirements.

Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2011 compared to March 31, 2010, primarily
due to increases in drafts and accounts payables, accrued liabilities and the current portion of
long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in receivables. Consolidated working capital
increased at March 31, 2010 compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to increases in cash and cash
equivalents, partially offset by an increase in net financial inventory and repayment of $215
million of our long-term debt in March 2010.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2011, compared to March
31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in total debt as a result of the US Oncology acquisition.
This ratio decreased at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009, primarily reflecting an
increase in cash and cash equivalents and repayment of $215 million of our long-term debt in March
2010.

The Company  paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of $0.06 per share on its common
stock from the fourth quarter of 1999 through the fourth quarter of 2008. In April 2008, the
quarterly dividend was raised from $0.06 to $0.12 per share and in May 2010, the quarterly dividend
was raised to $0.18 per common share. In April 2011, the Board approved an increase in the
quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share,
applicable to ensuing quarterly dividend declarations. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay
quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain
within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial
condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid total cash
dividends of $171 million, $131 million and $116 million.

Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases.

Represents primarily agreements with certain of our Canadian customers’ financial
institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory or our
customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those
financial institutions. We also have an agreement with one software customer that, under
limited circumstances, may require us to secure standby financing. Because the amount of the
standby financing is not explicitly stated, the overall amount of this guarantee cannot
reasonably be estimated. At March 31, 2011, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase
guarantees and customers’ debt guarantees were $138 million and $38 million, none of which had
been accrued.

At March 31, 2011, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding
associated interest and penalties, was approximately $485 million. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any
future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has
been excluded from the contractual obligations table.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In addition, at March 31, 2011, our banks and insurance companies have issued $128 million of
standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our
customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and
permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability
programs.

Credit Resources:

We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, our
accounts receivable sales facility, short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
commercial paper.

Senior Bridge Term Loan Facility

In connection with our execution of an agreement to acquire US Oncology, in November 2010, we
entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“Bridge Loan”). In
December 2010, we reduced the Bridge Loan commitment to $1.0 billion. On January 31, 2011, we
borrowed $1.0 billion under the Bridge Loan. On February 28, 2011, we repaid the funds obtained
under the Bridge Loan with long-term debt, as further described below, and the Senior Bridge Term
Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the Bridge Loan bore interest
of 1.76%, which was based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s
credit rating. Bridge Loan fees of $25 million were included in Corporate interest expense.

US Oncology Debt Acquired

Upon our purchase of US Oncology in December 2010, we assumed the outstanding debt of US
Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary US Oncology, Inc. Immediately prior to our
acquisition, US Oncology Holdings, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding Senior
Unsecured Floating Rate Toggle Notes due 2012, and US Oncology, Inc. called for redemption all of
its outstanding 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 and 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid interest of $50 million and redeemed these notes, including
the remaining accrued interest, for $1,738 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our
Bridge Loan.

Long-Term Debt

On February 28, 2011, we issued 3.25% notes due March 1, 2016 in an aggregate principal amount
of $600 million, 4.75% notes due March 1, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million and
6.00% notes due March 1, 2041 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest is
payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2011. We utilized net
proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $1,673 million from the issuance of these notes
for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the Bridge Loan. On
February 12, 2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014, in an aggregate principal amount of
$350 million and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019, in an aggregate principal amount of $350
million. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We utilized net proceeds,
after discounts and offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of these notes for general
corporate purposes.

In March 2010, we repaid our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior notes, which had matured.

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

In May 2010, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility (the “Facility”) for
an additional one year period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place, and
in doing so we increased our committed balance from $1.1 billion to $1.35 billion. From
time-to-time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts
receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. The renewed Facility will
expire in May 2011. We anticipate renewing this Facility before its expiration. At March 31, 2011,
there were no securitized accounts receivable balances or secured borrowings outstanding under the
Facility. As of March 31, 2010, there were no accounts receivable sold under the Facility.
Additionally, there were no sales of interests to third-party purchaser groups in the year ended
March 31, 2011.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in
Financial Notes 1 and 11, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to
the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Revolving Credit Facility

We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which
expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based upon either a
Prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate. There were no borrowings under this facility in
2011 and 2010 and $279 million for 2009. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts
outstanding under this facility.

Commercial Paper

There were no commercial paper issuances during 2011 and 2010 and no amount outstanding at
March 31, 2011 and 2010. We issued and repaid $3.3 billion of commercial paper in 2009.

Debt Covenant

Our various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our
principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility,
which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the
revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2011, this ratio was 35.7% and we
were in compliance with our other financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the
lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or
issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates.

Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be
met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital
market transactions.

RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS

Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial
Note 19, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements
appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

New accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been
recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant
Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)

Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest rate risk:

Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas
our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average
interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2011,
interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported.

Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates
decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average
interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2011, interest income
would have increased or decreased by approximately $17 million. The selected hypothetical change
in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.

As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with
exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.3 billion and $2.5 billion. The estimated fair
value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other
inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual
values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject
to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and
changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms.

Foreign exchange risk:

We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom,
Ireland, other European countries, Israel and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign
exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means,
including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency
assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the
use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the
potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of
March 31, 2011, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would
not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to
foreign currency risk.

McKESSON CORPORATION

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of McKesson Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining an
adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2011.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has also audited the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011. This audit report
appears on page 53 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

May 5, 2011



McKESSON CORPORATION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of McKesson Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended March 31, 2011. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule
(“financial statement schedule”) listed in the Index at Item 15(a). We also have audited the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31,
2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES

1.   Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

: McKesson Corporation (“McKesson,” the “Company,” or “we” and other
similar pronouns) is a corporation that delivers medicines, pharmaceutical supplies, information
and care management products and services designed to reduce costs and improve quality across the
healthcare industry. We conduct our business through two operating segments, McKesson Distribution
Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions, as further described in Financial Note 20, “Segments
of Business.”

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are
prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The
consolidated financial statements of McKesson include the financial statements of all wholly-owned
subsidiaries and majority-owned or controlled companies. We evaluate our ownership, contractual
and other interests in entities to determine if they are variable interest entities (“VIEs”), if we
have a variable interest in those entities and the nature and extent of those interests. These
evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based
on available historical information and management’s judgment, among other factors. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Period:

The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless
otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimated amounts.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original
maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash
equivalents.

We maintain cash and cash equivalents with several financial institutions. Bank deposits may
exceed the amount of federal deposit insurance; however, domestic non-interest bearing deposit
transaction amounts are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regardless of
the dollar amount. Cash equivalents may be invested in money market funds. We mitigate the risk
of our short-term investment portfolio by investing the majority of funds in U.S. government
securities, depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and
investment strategies of money market funds.

Restricted Cash

: Cash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general
operating purposes is classified as restricted cash and is included within prepaid expenses and
other in the consolidated balance sheets. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, restricted cash was not
material.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale:

We carry our marketable securities, which are
available for sale, at fair value and they are included in prepaid expenses and other in the
consolidated balance sheets. The net unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect,
computed in marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders’ equity. At
March 31, 2011 and 2010, marketable securities were not material.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Receivables:

Our trade receivables are subject to a
concentration of credit risk with customers primarily in our Distribution Solutions segment.
During 2011, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our total
consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”) and
Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”), accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total
consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2011, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were
approximately 43% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. (“Walmart”) and Rite Aid were approximately 13%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. As
a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payment, a material
reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customers or the loss of a large customer
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity. In addition, trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with
customers in the institutional, retail and healthcare provider sectors, which can be affected by a
downturn in the economy and changes in reimbursement policies. This credit risk is mitigated by
the size and diversity of the customer base as well as its geographic dispersion. We estimate the
receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and
ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance is recorded in our
consolidated financial statements for these amounts.

Financing Receivables:

We assess and monitor credit risk associated with financing
receivables, namely lease and notes receivables, through regular review of our collection
experience in determining our allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, we also evaluate
credit quality of our financing receivables utilizing aging of receivables and write-offs, as well
as consider existing economic conditions, to determine if an allowance is necessary. As of March
31, 2011, financing receivables and the related allowance were not material to our consolidated
financial statements.

Inventories:

We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for
our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution
Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the
last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the
first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer
hardware with cost determined by the standard cost method. Rebates, fees, cash discounts,
allowances, chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a
reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold.

The LIFO method was used to value approximately 87% of our inventories at March 31, 2011 and
2010. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $96 million and
$93 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2011,
2010 and 2009, we recognized net LIFO expense of $3 million, $8 million and $8 million within our
consolidated statements of operations. In 2011, our $3 million net LIFO expense related to our
non-pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases
on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of
price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded
pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the
net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price
increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.

We believe that the FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the
current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the
lower of LIFO or inventory as valued under FIFO. Primarily due to continued net deflation in
generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $156 million and $112
million higher than FIFO as of March 31, 2011 and 2010. As a result, in 2011 and 2010, we recorded
LCM charges of $44 million and $5 million in cost of sales within our consolidated statements of
operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

We include all costs to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver
inventory to our customers in distribution expenses.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

We state our property, plant and equipment at cost and
depreciate them under the straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of
properties over estimated service lives ranging from one to 30 years.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Capitalized Software Held for Sale:

Development costs for software held for sale, which
primarily pertain to our Technology Solutions segment, are capitalized once a project has reached
the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point
of general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life of
approximately three years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment
exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated
future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period.
At the end of the second quarter of 2010, our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management

TM

(“HzERM”) software product became generally available. In October 2010, we decreased our estimated
revenues over the next 24 months for our HzERM software product and as a result, concluded that the
estimated future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its
carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $72 million non-cash impairment charge in the second
quarter of 2011 within our Technology Solutions segment’s cost of sales to reduce the carrying
value of the software product to its net realizable value.

Additional information regarding our capitalized software expenditures is as follows:

Goodwill:

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if
indicators for potential impairment exist. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit
level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and
Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and
segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have
essentially similar operations, products, services and customers are aggregated as a single
reporting unit.

Impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of our reporting units to
the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a
second step is performed to calculate the amount of impairment, which would be recorded as a charge
in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of a reporting unit is based upon a
number of considerations including projections of revenues, earnings and discounted cash flows and
determination of market value multiples for similar businesses or guideline companies whose
securities are actively traded in public markets. The discount rate used for cash flows reflects
capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. In addition, we
compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair value to the Company’s market capitalization as
a further corroboration of the fair value. The testing requires a complex series of assumptions
and judgment by management in projecting future operating results, selecting guideline companies
for comparisons and assessing risks. The use of alternative assumptions and estimates could affect
the fair values and change the impairment determinations. There were no goodwill impairments
during 2011, 2010, or 2009.

Intangible assets:

Currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are
generally amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to
twenty years. We review identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted
cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any
impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.
There were no material impairments of intangible assets during 2011, 2010 or 2009.



McKESSON
CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use:

We capitalize costs of software held for internal
use during the application development stage of a project and amortize those costs over the assets’
estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, capitalized
software held for internal use was $446 million and $483 million, net of accumulated amortization
of $778 million and $665 million, and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets.

Insurance Programs:

Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain coverage for catastrophic
exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is our policy to
retain a significant portion of certain losses primarily related to workers’ compensation and
comprehensive general, product and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under these
programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred as
well as for claims incurred but not yet reported. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial
assumptions followed in the insurance industry.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenues for our Distribution Solutions segment are recognized when
product is delivered and title passes to the customer or when services have been rendered and there
are no further obligations to customers.

Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances, rebates and other incentives. Our
sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if they can be resold for
value or returned to suppliers for full credit. Sales returns are accrued based on estimates at
the time of sale to the customer. Sales returns from customers were approximately $1.4 billion in
2011, and $1.2 billion in 2010 and 2009. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to
governmental authorities are presented on a net basis; that is, they are excluded from revenues.

The revenues for our Distribution Solutions segment include large volume sales of
pharmaceuticals to a limited number of large customers who warehouse their own product. We order
bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central
distribution facility and deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the
manufacturer) directly to our customers’ warehouses. Sales to customers’ warehouses amounted to
$18.6 billion in 2011, $21.4 billion in 2010, and $25.8 billion in 2009. We also record revenues
for direct store deliveries from most of these same customers. Direct store deliveries are
shipments from the manufacturer to our customers of a limited category of products that require
special handling. We assume the primary liability to the manufacturer for these products.

Revenues are recorded gross when we are the primary party obligated in the transaction, take
title to and possession of the inventory, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in
establishing prices, assume the risk of loss for collection from customers as well as delivery or
return of the product, are responsible for fulfillment and other customer service requirements, or
the transactions have several but not all of these indicators.

Our Distribution Solutions segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may
contain a combination of various products and services. Revenue from a multiple element
arrangement is allocated to the separate elements based on estimates of fair value and recognized
in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element. If fair value
cannot be established for any undelivered element, all of the arrangement’s revenue is deferred
until delivery of the last element has occurred and services have been performed or until fair
value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements.

Revenues for our Technology Solutions segment are generated primarily by licensing software
and software systems (consisting of software, hardware and maintenance support), and providing
outsourcing and professional services. Revenue for this segment is recognized as follows:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service
agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of delivery or under the
percentage-of-completion method based on the terms and conditions in the contract. Contracts
accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on the ratio
of labor costs incurred to date to total estimated labor costs to be incurred. Changes in
estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to
earnings in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the
current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.

Hardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue from multi-year software
license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software implementation
fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion method.
Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or multi-year agreements and are
recognized ratably over the period covered by the agreements. Subscription, content and
transaction processing fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are
recognized ratably over the contracted terms beginning on the service start date for fixed fee
arrangements and recognized as transactions are performed beginning on the service start date for
per-transaction fee arrangements. Remote processing service fees are recognized monthly as the
service is performed. Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the service is performed.

We also offer certain products on an application service provider basis, making our software
functionality available on a remote hosting basis from our data centers. The data centers provide
system and administrative support, as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on an
application service provider basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract
beginning on the service start date of products hosted.

This segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain any combination
of software, hardware, implementation or consulting services, or maintenance services. When some
elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value (“VSOE”) exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered elements is
recognized upon delivery of such items. The segment establishes VSOE for hardware and
implementation and consulting services based on the price charged when sold separately, and for
maintenance services, based on renewal rates offered to customers. Revenue for the software
element is recognized under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all
of the undelivered elements in an arrangement. If fair value cannot be established for any
undelivered element, all of the arrangement’s revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last
element or until the fair value of the undelivered element is determinable.

Our Technology Solutions segment also includes revenues from disease management programs
provided to various states’ Medicaid programs. These service contracts include provisions for
achieving certain cost-savings and clinical targets. If the targets are not met for certain of
these contracts, a portion, or all, of the revenue must be refunded to the customer. We recognize
revenue during the term of the contract by assessing actual performance against contractual targets
and then determining the amount the customer would be legally obligated to pay if the contract
terminated as of the measurement date. These assessments include estimates of medical claims and
other data in accordance with the contract methodology. Because complete data is unavailable until
six to nine months after the measurement period, there is generally a significant time delay
between recording the accrual and the final settlement of the contract. If data is insufficient to
assess performance or we have not met the targets, we defer recognition of the revenue. As of
March 31, 2011 and 2010, we had deferred $25 million and $26 million related to these types of
contracts, which was included in deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. We generally
have been successful in achieving performance targets under these agreements.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Supplier Incentives:

Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating
to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of
goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a
result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of
goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory.

Supplier Reserves:

We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to
various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments
otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering
the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific
incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from
suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes
in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, supplier reserves were $102 million and
$89 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different than our estimate.
All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2011 and 2010 pertain to our Distribution Solutions
segment.

Income Taxes:

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions
are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is
greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon effective settlements. Deferred taxes are
not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are considered to be
permanently reinvested.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Our international subsidiaries generally consider their local
currency to be their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these international
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates and revenues and expenses
are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative currency translation
adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or losses in the stockholders’
equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses from currency
exchange transactions are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations and were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

Derivative financial instruments are used principally in
the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded on the consolidated
balance sheets at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in
the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income or losses and are recognized in the consolidated statements
of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. We periodically evaluate hedge effectiveness
and ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a
charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market
at the end of each accounting period with the change included in earnings. The volume of activity
related to derivative financial instruments was not material for 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Accounts Receivable Sales:

At March 31, 2011, we had a $1.35 billion accounts
receivable sales facility (“the Facility”). Through this Facility, McKesson Corporation, the
parent company, transfers certain U.S. pharmaceutical trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse
basis to a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary, which then sells these receivables to a
special purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of McKesson
Corporation that is consolidated in our financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided
interests in the pool of accounts receivable to third-party purchaser groups,  (the “Purchaser Groups”), which include financial
institutions and commercial paper conduits.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Prior to April 1, 2010, sales of undivided interests in the receivables by the SPE to the
Purchaser Groups were accounted for as sales because we had relinquished control of the receivables.
Accounts receivable sold under these transactions were excluded from receivables, net in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Fee charges from the Purchaser Groups were
recorded within administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

On April 1, 2010, we adopted amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets,
including securitization transactions, in which entities have continued exposure to risks related
to transferred financial assets. This amendment changed the requirements for derecognizing
financial assets and expanded the disclosure requirements for such transactions. The operations of
the Facility did not change, however as a result of the amended accounting guidance from April 1,
2010 forward, accounts receivable transactions under our Facility are accounted for as secured
borrowings rather than asset sales. Accounts receivable continue to be recognized on our
consolidated balance sheet and proceeds from the Purchaser groups are shown as secured borrowings.
Commencing in 2011, fee charges from the Purchaser Groups are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Share-Based Compensation:

We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a
fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense is recognized, for the
portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards
with performance conditions and multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting
basis. For awards with performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on
a straight-line basis. The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated
statements of operations or capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as
cash compensation paid to our employees.

Loss Contingencies:

We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters
arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and
reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate
loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often
difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not
be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and
decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.
Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time
relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both
the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of
possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the
proceeding is provided.

Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or
when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We
review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed
and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As
discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is
complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties,
such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear
directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries
of high and low estimate.

Business Combinations:

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of
accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date
of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Effective April 1, 2009,
acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business
combinations and are expensed as incurred. Acquisition-related expenses totaled $52 million in 2011
and were not material in 2010.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets:

On April 1, 2010, we adopted amended
accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, in
which entities have continued exposure to risks related to transferred financial assets. This
amendment changed the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and expanded the disclosure
requirements for such transactions. As a result of the amended accounting guidance, from April 1,
2010 forward, accounts receivable transactions under our accounts receivable sales
facility are accounted for as secured borrowings rather than asset sales.

Consolidations:

On April 1, 2010, we adopted amended accounting guidance for consolidation
of VIEs. The new guidance eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining
the primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an
enterprise is the primary beneficiary, including ongoing assessments of control over such entities.
The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

Financing Receivables:

On October 1, 2010, we adopted amended accounting guidance which
expands disclosures regarding credit quality and the related allowance for credit losses of
financing receivables. On January 1, 2011, we adopted additional disclosure requirements
regarding activity during a reporting period. The adoption of the amended guidance did not have an
impact on our consolidated financial results as these changes relate only to disclosures. Because
our financing receivables are not material to our consolidated financial statements, the
disclosures required under the new accounting guidance have been omitted from our Financial Notes
with the exception of certain accounting policy disclosures which describe how we assess and
monitor credit risk associated with our financing receivables.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued amended standards that clarify and provide additional disclosure requirements
related to recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. These
standards also amend requirements for employer’s disclosure about post retirement benefit plan
assets to conform to the fair value disclosure requirement. On January 1, 2010, we adopted the
amended standards, except for the disclosures about the roll-forward of activity in Level 3
(measurement using significant unobservable inputs) fair value measurements, which are effective
for us on April 1, 2011. The adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material effect on
our consolidated financial statements.

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue Recognition:

In October 2009, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance for
multiple-element arrangements. The amended guidance eliminates the use of the residual method and
incorporates the use of an estimated selling price to allocate arrangement consideration. The
amended guidance will become effective for us for multiple-element arrangements entered into or
materially modified on or after April 1, 2011. We do not anticipate the adoption of the amended
guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance for certain revenue arrangements that
include software elements. The guidance amends pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing
from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non-software components that
function together to deliver the product’s functionality. The amended guidance will become
effective for us for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after April 1,
2011. We do not anticipate the adoption of the amended guidance to have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

In April 2010, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance for vendors who apply the milestone
method of revenue recognition to research and development arrangements. The amended guidance
applies to arrangements with payments that are contingent, at inception, upon achieving
substantively uncertain future events or circumstances. The amended guidance is effective on a
prospective basis for us for milestones achieved on or after April 1, 2011. We do not anticipate
the adoption of the amended guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

2.   Business Combinations

On December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology Holdings, Inc.
(“US Oncology”) of The Woodlands, Texas for approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of cash
consideration of $0.2 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of liabilities with a fair
value of $1.9 billion. As an integrated oncology company, US Oncology is affiliated with
community-based oncologists, and works with patients, hospitals, payers and the medical industry
across all phases of the cancer research and delivery continuum. The acquisition of US Oncology
expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and adds practice management
services for oncologists. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand.

The following table summarizes the preliminary recording of the fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:

Represents amounts reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2010.

During the fourth quarter of 2011, the fair value measurements of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were revised. Due to the recent timing of the acquisition, these amounts are subject to change
within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized.

Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $1.0
billion, the fair value of which was determined by using Level 3 inputs, which are estimated using
significant unobservable inputs. Acquired intangibles primarily consist of $0.7 billion of service
agreements and $0.2 billion of customer lists. The estimated weighted average lives of the service
agreements, customer lists and total acquired intangibles are 18 years, 10 years and 16 years. The
fair value of the debt acquired was determined primarily by using Level 3 inputs, which are
estimated using significant unobservable inputs. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Debt and Financing
Activities,” for additional information on the assumption and funding of acquired debt. The excess
of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $808 million was
recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon
integrating the business.

Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our
Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. We recorded $52 million of
net acquisition-related expenses in 2011 as follows:

On May 21, 2008, we acquired McQueary Brothers Drug Company (“McQueary Brothers”) of
Springfield, Missouri for approximately $190 million. McQueary Brothers is a regional distributor
of pharmaceutical, health and beauty products to independent and regional chain pharmacies in the
Midwestern U.S. This acquisition expanded our existing U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business.
The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. Financial results for McQueary Brothers have been
included within our Distribution Solutions segment since the date of acquisition.

During the first quarter of 2010, the fair value measurements of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were completed. The excess of the purchase price
over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $126 million was recorded as goodwill,
which primarily reflected the expected future benefits from synergies to be realized upon
integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation were acquired identifiable
intangibles of $61 million primarily representing a customer relationship with a useful life of 7
years, a trade name of $2 million with a useful life of less than one year and a not-to-compete
agreement of $4 million with a useful life of 4 years.

During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within
both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included
in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices
for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition.

Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have not been
presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either
an individual or an aggregate basis.

3.   Share-Based Compensation

We provide share-based compensation for our employees, officers and non-employee directors,
including stock options, an employee stock purchase plan, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and
performance-based restricted stock units (“PeRSUs”) (collectively, “share-based awards.”) Most of
our share-based awards are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Compensation expense for the share-based awards is recognized for the portion of awards
ultimately expected to vest. We estimate the number of share-based awards,
which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. The estimated forfeiture rate
established upon grant is re-assessed throughout the requisite service period. As required, the
forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual
forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than current estimates. The
weighted-average forfeiture rate was approximately 5% at March 31, 2011.

The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of
operations or capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash
compensation paid to our employees. There was no material share-based compensation expense
capitalized as part of the cost of an asset in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

(3)

Income tax expense is computed using the tax rates of applicable tax jurisdictions.
Additionally, a portion of pre-tax compensation expense is not tax-deductible.

Stock Plans

The 2005 Stock Plan provides our employees, officers and non-employee director’s share-based
long-term incentives. The 2005 Stock Plan permits the granting of up to 42.5 million shares in the
form of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PeRSUs and other share-based awards. As of March
31, 2011, 13 million shares remain available for future grant under the 2005 Stock Plan.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at no less than fair market value and those options granted under
the 2005 Stock Plan generally have a contractual term of seven years and follow a four-year vesting
schedule.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period and is based on the grant-date fair value for the portion of the awards
that is ultimately expected to vest. We continue to use the Black-Scholes options-pricing model to
estimate the fair value of our stock options. Once the fair value of an employee stock option is
determined, current accounting practices do not permit it to be changed, even if the estimates used
are different from actual. The options-pricing model requires the use of various estimates and
assumptions as follows:

•

Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of
our common stock and implied market volatility. We believe that this market-based input
provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with
employee stock option valuation considerations.

•

Expected dividend yield is based on historical experience and investors’ current
expectations.

•

The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based
on the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant.

•

Expected life of the options is based primarily on historical employee stock option
exercise and other behavior data and reflects the impact of changes in contractual life of
current option grants compared to our historical grants.

Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options were as
follows:

RSUs and PeRSUs

RSUs, which entitle the holder to receive at the end of a vesting term a specified number of
shares of the Company’s common stock are accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. Total
compensation expense for RSUs under our stock plans is determined by the product of the number of
shares that are expected to vest and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock.
The Compensation Committee determines the vesting terms at the time of grant. These awards
generally vest in three to four years. We recognize expense for RSUs with a single vest date on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We have elected to expense the grant date
fair value of RSUs with only graded vesting and service conditions on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of RSUs, which vest immediately and are
expensed upon grant. However, issuance of any underlying shares granted prior to the July 2008
Annual Meeting of Stockholders is deferred until the director is no longer performing services for
the Company. For those RSUs granted subsequent to July 2008, the director may choose to receive
payment immediately or defer receipt of the underlying shares if they meet director stock ownership
guidelines. At March 31, 2011, 113,000 RSUs for our directors are vested, but shares have not been
issued.

PeRSUs are RSUs for which the number of RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of
one or more performance objectives over a specified period. PeRSUs are accounted for as variable
awards until the performance goals are reached and the grant date is established. Total
compensation expense for PeRSUs is determined by the product of the number of shares eligible to be
awarded and expected to vest, and the market price of the Company’s common stock, commencing at the
inception of the requisite service period. During the performance period, the compensation expense
for PeRSUs is re-computed using the market price and the performance modifier at the end of a
reporting period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are
granted and classified as RSUs and accounted for on that basis. For PeRSUs granted during or prior to 2009,
for which the related RSU grant has multiple vesting
 dates, we recognize the compensation expense of these awards on a graded vesting
basis over the requisite aggregate service period of four years. For PeRSUs granted during or after 2009, for which the related RSU has a single vesting date, we recognize
compensation expense of these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite aggregate service period of four years.

granted in the first quarter of 2012 (the “2011 PeRSU”). These target share units are not included
in the table above as they have not been granted in the form of RSUs. As of March 31, 2011, the
total compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested 2011 PeRSUs not yet
recognized was approximately $93 million, pre-tax (based on the period-end market price of the
Company’s common stock) and the weighted-average period over which the cost is expected to be

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

The Company has an ESPP under which 16 million shares have been authorized for issuance. The
ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions.
The deductions occur over three-month purchase periods and the shares are then purchased at 85% of
the market price at the end of each purchase period. Employees are allowed to terminate their
participation in the ESPP at any time during the purchase period prior to the purchase of the
shares. The 15% discount provided to employees on these shares is included in compensation
expense. The shares related to funds outstanding at the end of a quarter are included in the
calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. These amounts have not been
significant. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, 1 million shares were issued under the ESPP and 2 million
shares remain available for issuance at March 31, 2011.

In 2010, we sold our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions LLC (“MLS”), a
Canadian logistics company, for a pre-tax gain of $17 million or $14 million after-tax.

In 2009, we sold our 42% equity interest in Verispan LLC, a data analytics
company, for a pre-tax gain of $24 million or $14 million after-tax.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying values of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline
in value. In 2009, we determined that the fair value of our interest in Parata Systems, LLC
(“Parata”) was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was other-than-temporary.
Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results
and market capitalization rates. We determined the impairment was other-than-temporary based on
our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investee’s financial
condition and weak market conditions. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax impairment of $58 million
($55 million after-tax) on this investment, which is recorded within other income, net in the
consolidated statements of operations. Our investment in Parata is accounted for under the equity
method of accounting

In 2009, we also recorded a pre-tax impairment of $5 million ($5 million after-tax) on another
equity-held investment.

In 2011, income tax expense included $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items,
which primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued
interest.

In 2009, income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete
items of which, $87 million represents a non-cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition
of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service
 (“IRS”) is currently examining our fiscal
years 2003 through 2006 and we anticipate the field work will be completed and they will issue the Revenue Agent Report in our first quarter of fiscal 2012.
We have received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of $169 million
related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2007. Payments of most of the assessments to the CRA have
been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed
a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007. If
we are not successful in resolving these issues with the CRA, a trial date has been set for October 17, 2011
with the Tax Court of Canada. We believe that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse
results relating to the IRS and CRA examinations. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense.

In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years prior to 2003 are no longer subject to examination.



McKESSON
CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax
provision. Although our major taxing jurisdictions are the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to
income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Annually, we file a federal consolidated income
tax return with the IRS and over 1,200 returns with various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our
income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of
estimated current and future taxes to be paid.

At March 31, 2011, undistributed earnings of our foreign operations totaling $2.7 billion were
considered to be permanently reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been recognized
on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the
foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite
period of time. The
determination of the amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable because the
computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a decision to repatriate
the earnings is made.

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

We have federal, state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $267
million, $2.9 billion and $239 million. The federal and state net operating losses will expire at
various dates from 2012 through 2031. Substantially all of our foreign net operating losses have
indefinite lives. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain
federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards may not be realized. In recognition of
this risk, we have provided valuation allowances of $16 million and $58 million on the deferred tax
assets relating to these state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We also have state
capital loss carryforwards of $27 million which will expire at various dates from 2012 through 2015.

We also have domestic income tax credit carryforwards of $191 million which are primarily
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that have an indefinite life. However, we believe
that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state tax credits of $15 million may
not be fully realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $2
million. In addition, we have Canadian research and development credit carryforwards of $12
million. The Canadian research and development credits will expire at various dates from 2018 to
2031.

On
December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology.
As part of acquisition accounting, we recorded net  deferred tax liabilities of $170 million on the
 opening balance sheet. The $170 million included deferred tax liabilities of $339 million for basis differences in intangible assets, offset by deferred tax
assets of $83 million for federal and state net operating losses and $86 million for other future deductible and taxable differences.

Of the total $635 million in unrecognized tax benefits at March 31, 2011, $415 million would
reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months,
it is reasonably possible that audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations
could potentially reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by up to $88 million. However, this amount
may change because we continue to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities
throughout the year.

We report interest and penalties on tax deficiencies as income tax expense. At
March 31, 2011, before any tax benefits, our accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits amounted
to $136 million. We recognized an income tax expense of $16 million, before any tax effect,
related to interest in our consolidated statements of operations during 2011. We have no material
amounts accrued for penalties.

6.   Discontinued Operation

In July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia
Pacific Pty Limited (“MAP”), a provider of phone and web-based healthcare services in Australia and
New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of $109 million. The divestiture generated a pre-tax and
after-tax gain of $95 million and $72 million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize
capital loss carry-forwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million.
The release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our after-tax gain on the
divestiture. The after-tax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our
statement of operations in 2011. The historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP
were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

7.   Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share
are computed similar
to basic earnings per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock. Potentially dilutive securities primarily include outstanding stock options,
RSUs and PeRSUs.

The computations for basic and diluted earnings per common share from continuing and
discontinued operations are as follows:

Senior Bridge Term Loan Facility

In connection with our execution of an agreement to acquire US Oncology, in November 2010 we
entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“Bridge Loan”). In
December 2010, we reduced the Bridge Loan commitment to $1.0 billion. On January 31, 2011, we
borrowed $1.0 billion under the Bridge Loan. On February 28, 2011, we repaid the funds obtained
under the Bridge Loan with long-term debt, as further described below, and the Senior Bridge Term
Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the Bridge Loan bore interest
of 1.76%, which was based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s
credit rating. Bridge Loan fees of $25 million were included in interest expense.

US Oncology Debt Acquired

Upon our purchase of US Oncology in December 2010, we assumed the outstanding debt of US
Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary US Oncology, Inc. Immediately prior to our
acquisition, US Oncology Holdings, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding Senior
Unsecured Floating Rate Toggle Notes due 2012 and US Oncology, Inc. called for redemption all of
its outstanding 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 and 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid interest of $50 million and redeemed these notes, including
the remaining accrued interest for $1,738 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our
Bridge Loan.

Long-Term Debt

On February 28, 2011, we issued 3.25% notes due March 1, 2016 in an aggregate principal amount
of $600 million, 4.75% notes due March 1, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million and
6.00% notes due March 1, 2041 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest is
payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2011. We utilized net
proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $1,673 million from the issuance of these notes
(each note constitutes a “Series”) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
borrowings under the Bridge Loan.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

On February 12, 2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014 in an aggregate principal
amount of $350 million and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019 in an aggregate principal amount of
$350 million. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We utilized net
proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of these notes
(each note constitutes a “Series”) for general corporate purposes.

Each Series constitutes an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Company and ranks
equally with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness
outstanding from time-to-time. Each Series is governed by materially similar indentures and an
officers’ certificate specifying certain terms of each Series.

Upon 30 days notice to holders of a Series, we may redeem that Series at any time prior to
maturity, in whole or in part, for cash at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid
interest and a make-whole premium, as specified in the indenture and officers’ certificate relating
to that Series. In the event of the occurrence of both (1) a change of control of the Company and
(2) a downgrade of a Series below an investment grade rating by each of Fitch Ratings, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services within a specified period, an offer
will be made to purchase that Series from the holders at a price in cash equal to 101% of the then
outstanding principal amount of that Series, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the date of repurchase. The indenture and the related officers’ certificate for each
Series, subject to the exceptions and in compliance with the conditions as applicable, specify that
we may not incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or consolidate, merge or sell
all or substantially all of our assets. The indentures also contain customary events and default
provisions.

In March 2010, we repaid our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior Notes which had matured.

Scheduled future principal payments of long-term debt are $417 million in 2012, $509 million
in 2013, $352 million in 2014, $2 million in 2015, $604 million in 2016 and $2.1 billion
thereafter.

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

In May 2010, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility (the “Facility”) for
an additional one year period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place, and
in doing so, we increased our committed balance from $1.1 billion to $1.35 billion. From
time-to-time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts
receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. The renewed Facility will
expire in May 2011. We anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration.

Through the Facility, McKesson Corporation, the parent company, transfers certain U.S.
pharmaceutical trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a wholly-owned and consolidated
subsidiary, which then sells these receivables to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a
wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of McKesson Corporation that is consolidated in our
financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided interests in the pool of accounts receivable
to third-party purchaser groups (the “Purchaser Groups”), which include financial institutions and
commercial paper conduits.

Interests in the pool of accounts receivable that are sold to the Purchaser Groups and
accounts receivable retained by the Company are carried at face value, which, due to the short-term
nature of our accounts receivable and terms of the Facility, approximates fair value. McKesson
receives cash in the amount of the face value for the undivided interests sold. No gain or loss is
recorded upon the utilization of the facility as fee charges from the Purchaser Groups are based
upon a floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests remain outstanding.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The Facility contains requirements relating to the performance of the accounts receivable and
covenants relating to the SPE and the Company. If we do not comply with these covenants, our
ability to use the Facility may be suspended and repayment of any outstanding balances under the
Facility may be required. At March 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants. Should we
default under the Facility, the Purchaser Groups are entitled to receive only collections on the
accounts receivable owned by the SPE.

Prior to 2011, transactions in the Facility were accounted for as sales because we met the
requirements of the existing accounting guidance, including relinquishing control of the accounts
receivable. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold would have been excluded from accounts
receivable, net in the accompanying March 31, 2010 consolidated balance sheet had any balances been
outstanding in the Facility at that date. On April 1, 2010, we
adopted amended accounting guidance
for transfers of financial assets. Transactions under the Facility no longer meet the requirements
for sale as defined in the amended accounting guidance primarily because the Company’s retained
interest in the pool of accounts receivable is subordinated to the Purchaser Groups to the extent
there is any outstanding balance in the Facility. Consequently, the related accounts receivable
would continue to be recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and proceeds from the Purchaser
Groups would be shown as secured borrowings. Commencing in 2011, fee
charges from the Purchaser
Groups are recorded in interest expense within the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to
2011, these fee charges were recorded in Corporate administrative expenses. Additionally, any proceeds from these accounts
receivable transactions would be reflected in the financing section within the statements of cash
flows.

We continue servicing the accounts receivable sold. No servicing asset is recorded at the
time of utilization of the facility because we do not receive any servicing fees from third parties
or other income related to servicing the receivable. We do not record any servicing liability at
the time of the utilization of the facility as the accounts receivable collection period is
relatively short and the costs of servicing the accounts receivable over the servicing period are
insignificant. Servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing period.

Information regarding receivables subject to borrowings as of March 31, 2011 or our
outstanding balances related to our interests in accounts receivable sold or qualifying receivables

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Revolving Credit Facility

We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which
expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based upon either a
Prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate. There were no borrowings under this facility in
2011 or 2010 and $279 million for 2009. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts
outstanding under this facility.

Commercial Paper

There were no commercial paper issuances during 2011 and 2010 and no amount outstanding at
March 31, 2011 and 2010. We issued and repaid $3.3 billion of commercial paper in 2009.

Debt Covenants

Our various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our
principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility,
which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the
revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2011, this ratio was 35.7% and we
were in compliance with our other financial covenants.

12.   Pension Benefits

We maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined pension benefit plans and defined
contribution plans for eligible employees.

Defined Pension Benefit Plans

Eligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company prior to December 31, 1996 are
covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan. In 1997, we amended this plan
to freeze all plan benefits based on each employee’s plan compensation and creditable service
accrued to that date. The Company has made no annual contributions since this plan was frozen.
The benefits for this defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at
date of retirement, years of service and employees’ pay during the five years prior to retirement.
We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible Canadian and United Kingdom employees as
well as an unfunded nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plan for certain U.S. executives.
Defined benefit plan assets and obligations are measured as of the Company’s fiscal year-end.

The net periodic expense for our pension plans is as follows:

The projected unit credit method is utilized in measuring net periodic pension expense over

straight-line over the average remaining future service periods.

We expect to amortize $2 million of prior service cost and $25 million of actuarial loss for
the pension plans from stockholders’ equity to pension expense in 2012. Comparable 2011 amounts
were $2 million and $26 million.

Projected benefit obligations relating to our unfunded U.S. plans were $154 million and $137
million at March 31, 2011 and 2010. Pension obligations for our unfunded plans are funded based on
the recommendations of independent actuaries.

Expected benefit payments for our pension plans are as follows: $38 million, $42 million, $34
million, $136 million and $36 million for 2012 to 2016 and $194 million for 2017 through 2021.
Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations
and include estimated future employee service. Expected contributions to be made for our pension
plans are $16 million for 2012.

Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the net periodic pension expense and the

Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan liabilities are valued using a discount rate based on a
yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated AA or better whose
maturities are aligned with the expected benefit payments of our plans. For March 31, 2011, we
used a weighted average discount rate of 4.88%, which represents a decrease of 41 basis points from
our 2010 weighted-average discount rate of 5.29%.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

: The overall objective for McKesson’s pension plan assets is to generate
long-term investment returns consistent with capital preservation and prudent investment practices,
with a diversification of asset types and investment strategies. Periodic adjustments are made to
provide liquidity for benefit payments and to rebalance plan assets to their target allocations.

The target allocations for plan assets at March 31, 2011 are 61% equity securities, 32% fixed
income securities and 7% to all other types of investments including cash and cash equivalents.
The target allocations for plan assets at March 31, 2010 were 59% equity securities, 33% fixed
income securities and 8% to all other types of investments including cash and cash equivalents.
Equity securities include primarily exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies
from diverse industries. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diverse
industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other.
Other investments include real estate funds, hedge funds and cash and cash equivalents. Portions
of the equity, fixed income and cash and cash equivalent investments are held in commingled funds.

We develop our expected long-term rate of return assumption based on the historical experience
of our portfolio and review of projected performance by asset class of broad, publicly traded
equity and fixed-income indices. Our target asset allocation was determined based on the risk
tolerance characteristics of the plans and at times may be adjusted to achieve our overall
investment objectives.

Fair Value Measurements:

The following tables represent our pension plan assets as of March
31, 2011 and 2010, using the fair value hierarchy by asset class. The fair value hierarchy has
three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers
to fair values determined based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3
includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment
funds that maintain daily liquidity and have a constant unit value of $1.00. The funds invest in
short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics
emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Cash and cash equivalents are generally classified
as Level 1 investments. Some cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds, which have a
daily net value derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these
are classified as Level 2 investments.

Common and preferred stock — This investment class consists of common and preferred shares
issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price
quotes are readily available. Preferred shares are not actively traded. Holdings of common shares
are generally classified as Level 1 investments. Preferred shares are classified as Level 2
investments.

Equity commingled funds — Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock are
held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from quoted prices for the
underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 2 investments.

Government securities — This investment class consists of bonds and debentures issued by
central governments or federal agencies. Multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing
vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations. We have obtained an
understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs
used in deriving such prices. These securities are classified as Level 2 investments.

Corporate bonds — This investment class consists of bonds and debentures issued by
corporations. Multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible,
which enables cross-provider validations. We have obtained an understanding of how these prices
are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices.
When inputs are observable, securities are classified as Level 2 investments; otherwise, securities
are classified as Level 3 investments.

used in deriving such prices. When inputs are observable, securities are classified as Level 2
investments; otherwise, securities are classified as Level 3 investments.

Asset-backed securities and other — This investment class consists of debt obligations secured
by non-mortgage-backed assets or pools of assets. Multiple prices and price types are obtained
from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations. We have obtained
an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the
inputs used in deriving such prices. When inputs are observable, securities are classified as
Level 2 investments; otherwise, securities are classified as Level 3 investments.

Fixed income commingled funds — Some of the fixed income securities are held in commingled
funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are
classified as Level 2 investments.

Real estate funds — The value of the real estate funds is reported by the fund manager and is
based on a valuation of the underlying properties. Inputs used in the valuation include items such
as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.
The real estate funds are classified as Level 3 investments.

Hedge funds — The hedge funds are invested in fund-of-fund structures and consist of multiple
investments in interest and currency funds designed to hedge the risk of rate fluctuations. Given
the complex nature of valuation and the broad spectrums of investments, the hedge funds are
classified as Level 3 investments.

The following table represents a reconciliation of Level 3 plan assets held during the years

Concentration of Credit Risk:

We evaluated our pension plans’ asset portfolios for the
existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of March 31, 2011. Types of
concentrations that were evaluated include investment funds that represented 10% or more of the
pension plans’ net assets. As of March 31, 2011, 11% of our plan assets is comprised of Bartram
International Fund, which holds only actively traded stock.

Other Defined Benefit Plans

Under various U.S. bargaining unit labor contracts, we make payments into multi-employer
pension plans established for union employees. We are liable for a proportionate part of the
plans’ unfunded vested benefit upon our withdrawal from the plan; however, information regarding
the relative position of each employer with respect to the actuarial present value of accumulated
benefits and net assets available for benefits is not available. Contributions to the plans and
amounts accrued were not material for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Defined Contribution Plans

We have a contributory profit sharing investment plan (“PSIP”) for U.S. employees not covered
by collective bargaining arrangements. Effective January 1, 2011,
eligible employees may contribute to the PSIP up to 75% of
their monthly eligible compensation for pre-tax contributions and up
to 75% of compensation for
catch-up contributions not to exceed IRS limits. The Company makes matching contributions in an
amount equal to 100% of the employee’s first 3% of pay contributed and 50% for the next 2% of pay
contributed. The Company also may make an additional annual matching contribution for each plan
year to enable participants to receive a full match based on their
annual contribution.

The Company’s leveraged employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) had purchased an aggregate of
24 million shares of the Company’s common stock since its inception. These purchases were financed
by 10 to 20 year loans from or guaranteed by us. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no
outstanding ESOP loans nor the related receivables from the ESOP as the ESOP fully repaid the loans
during 2010. The loans were repaid by the ESOP from interest earnings on cash balances and common
dividends on unallocated shares and Company cash contributions. The ESOP loan maturities and rates
were identical to the terms of related Company borrowings. Stock was made available from the ESOP
based on debt service payments on ESOP borrowings. In 2011 and 2009, the Company made
contributions primarily in cash or with the issuance of treasury shares. In the first quarter of
2011, all of the 24 million common shares had been allocated to plan participants. As a result,
future PSIP contributions will be funded with cash or treasury shares.

The McKesson Corporation PSIP was a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated
Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the
distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119
million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of
the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP
participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and were
allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately
$77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the “Unallocated
Proceeds”) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an ESOP suspense account. In accordance
with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated Proceeds to current PSIP
participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt of the Unallocated
Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Company’s common stock held by
the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action
class-holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP or ESOP.
Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Company’s financial statements relating
to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP.

As a result of the PSIP’s receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds, in 2010 the Company contributed
$1 million to the PSIP. Accordingly, the PSIP expense for 2010 was nominal. In 2011, the Company
resumed its contributions to the PSIP.

PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows:

13.   Postretirement Benefits

We maintain a number of postretirement benefits, primarily consisting of healthcare and life
insurance (“welfare”) benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees. Eligible employees consist of
those who retired before March 31, 1999 and those who retired after March 31, 1999, but were an
active employee as of that date, after
meeting other age-related criteria. We also provide postretirement benefits for certain U.S.
executives. Defined benefit plan obligations are measured as of the Company’s fiscal year-end.

The net periodic expense (income) for our postretirement welfare benefits is as follows:

The components of the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income for the
Company’s other postretirement benefits at March 31, 2011 and 2010 were net actuarial loss of $5
million and net actuarial gain of $1 million and net prior service credits of $2 million and $2
million. Other changes in benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income were net
actuarial losses of $6 million for 2011 and $51 million for 2010 and net actuarial gain of $12
million for 2009.

We estimate that the amortization of the actuarial loss from stockholders’ equity to other
postretirement expense in 2012 will be $1 million ($4 million of actuarial gain in 2011).

Other postretirement benefits are funded as claims are paid. Expected benefit payments for
our postretirement welfare benefit plans, net of expected Medicare subsidy receipts of $1 million
annually, are as follows: $12 million annually for 2012 to 2016 and $56 million cumulatively for
2017 through 2021. Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the
benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. Expected contributions to be
made for our postretirement welfare benefit plans are $14 million for 2012.

Weighted-average discount rates used to estimate postretirement welfare benefit expenses were
5.33%, 7.86% and 6.19% for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Weighted-average discount rates for the actuarial
present value of benefit obligations were 5.09%, 5.33% and 7.86% for 2011, 2010 and 2009.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Actuarial gain or loss for the postretirement welfare benefit plan is amortized to income or
expense over a three-year period. The assumed healthcare cost trends used in measuring the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were 8.5% and 8.5% for prescription drugs, 7.5% and
7.5% for medical and 5.8% and 6% for dental in 2011 and 2010. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, a
one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would not have
a material impact on the postretirement benefit obligations.

14.   Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

At March 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, marketable securities, receivables, drafts and accounts payable and other current liabilities
approximated their estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial
instruments. All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity of three months
or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents. Included in cash and
cash equivalents at March 31, 2011 and 2010, are money market fund investments of $1.7 billion and
$2.3 billion, which are reported at fair value. The fair value of these investments was determined
by using quoted prices for identical investments in active markets, which are considered to be
Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance. The carrying value of
all other cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their relatively short-term nature.

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was
$4.0 billion and $4.3 billion at March 31, 2011 and $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion at March 31,
2010. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using
quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may
not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in
the future.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations. We limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and
forward foreign exchange contracts. In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for
hedging purposes. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The volume of
activity related to derivative financial instruments was not material for 2011, 2010 and 2009.

15.   Lease Obligations

We lease facilities and equipment almost solely under operating leases. In connection with
our acquisition of US Oncology, we assumed noncancellable operating lease obligations of office
space and equipment. At March 31, 2011, future minimum lease payments required under operating
leases that have initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year for years
ending March 31 are:

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Rental expense under operating leases was $157 million, $154 million and $146 million in 2011,
2010 and 2009. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease,
taking into account, when applicable, lessor incentives for tenant improvements, periods where no
rent payment is required and escalations in rent payments over the term of the lease. Deferred
rent is recognized for the difference between the rent expense recognized on a straight-line basis
and the payments made per the terms of the lease. Remaining terms for facilities leases generally
range from one to seven years, while remaining terms for equipment leases range from one to three
years. Most real property leases contain renewal options (generally for five-year increments) and
provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and operating expenses in excess of base period
amounts. Sublease rental income was not material for any period presented.

16.   Financial Guarantees and Warranties

Financial Guarantees

We have agreements with certain of our Canadian customers’ financial institutions under which
we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory or our customers’ debt in the event
these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. For our
inventory repurchase agreement, among other requirements, inventories must be in resalable
condition and any repurchase would be at a discount. The inventory repurchase agreements mostly
range from one to two years. Customers’ debt guarantees range from one to five years and were
primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain customers. The majority of our customers’
debt guarantees are secured by certain assets of the customer. We also have an agreement with one
software customer that, under limited circumstances, may require us to secure standby financing.
Because the amount of the standby financing is not explicitly stated, the overall amount of this
guarantee cannot reasonably be estimated. At March 31, 2011, the maximum amounts of inventory
repurchase guarantees and customers’ debt guarantees were $138 million and $38 million, none of
which had been accrued.

The expirations of the above noted financial guarantees are as follows: $119 million, $21
million, $3 million, $4 and $1 million from 2012 through 2016 and $28 million thereafter.

In addition, at March 31, 2011, our banks and insurance companies have issued $128 million of
standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our
customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and
permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability
programs.

Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying
customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third party’s intellectual
property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such
indemnification agreements and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations.

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine
indemnification agreements (such as retention of previously existing environmental, tax and
employee liabilities) whose terms vary in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where
appropriate, obligations for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the
amounts of these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum
amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as
liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have historically not made significant payments as a
result of these indemnification provisions.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Warranties

In the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and indemnification protection
for our products and services. For example, we provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and
medical-surgical products we distribute are in compliance with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
other applicable laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our suppliers,
which customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In addition, we have indemnity
obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been provided to us from our
suppliers, either through express agreement or by operation of law.

We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and automation products we
sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring the product into compliance with previously
agreed upon specifications. For software products, this may result in additional project costs,
which are reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for
software installation services within these contracts. In addition, most of our customers who
purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance agreements.
Revenues from these maintenance agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
contract period and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when claims
become estimable. Accrued warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.

17.   Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject
to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating
to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our
business. As described below, many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and many seek an
indeterminate amount of damages.

When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the
amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect
to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of
the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the
potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate
resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over
many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at
least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate
cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.

Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or
when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We
review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed
and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. As discussed
above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when
the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as
regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on
whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and
low estimates.

We are party to the legal proceedings described below. Unless otherwise stated, we are
currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the unresolved proceedings
described below. Should any one or a combination of more than one of these proceedings be
successful, or should we determine to settle any or a combination of these matters, we may be
required to pay substantial sums, become subject to the entry of an injunction or be forced to
change the manner in which we operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on
our financial position or results of operations.

I. Average Wholesale Price Litigation

The following matters involve a drug reimbursement benchmark referred to as the “AWP” utilized
by some public and private payers to calculate at least some portion of the amount a pharmacy will
be reimbursed for dispensing a covered prescription drug.

A. In re McKesson Governmental Entities Average Wholesale Price Litigation

Commencing in May of 2008, a series of complaints were filed in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts by various public payers — governmental entities that paid
any portion of the price of certain prescription drugs  —  alleging that in late 2001 the Company
and First DataBank, Inc. (“FDB”), a publisher of pharmaceutical pricing information, conspired to
improperly raise the published AWP for certain prescription drugs, and that this alleged conduct
resulted in higher drug reimbursement payments by plaintiffs and others similarly situated. These
actions were all consolidated under the caption

In re McKesson Governmental Entities Average
Wholesale Price Litigation.

A description of these actions is as follows:

The San Francisco Action

On May 20, 2008, an action was filed by the San Francisco Health Plan on behalf of itself and
a purported class of political subdivisions in the State of California and by the San Francisco
City Attorney on behalf of the “People of the State of California” in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company as the sole defendant, alleging
violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO,”) 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), the California Cartwright Act, California’s False Claims Act, California Business and
Professions Code §§ 17200 and 17500 and seeking damages, treble damages, civil penalties,
restitution, interest and attorneys’ fees, all in unspecified amounts,

San Francisco Health Plan,
et al. v. McKesson Corporation,

(Civil Action No. 1:08-CV-10843-PBS) (“San Francisco Action”). On
July 3, 2008, an amended complaint was filed in the San Francisco Action adding a claim for
tortious interference. On January 13, 2009, a second amended complaint was filed in the San
Francisco Action that abandoned all previously alleged antitrust claims.

The Connecticut Action

On May 28, 2008, an action was filed by the State of Connecticut in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company, again as the sole defendant, alleging
violations of civil RICO, the Sherman Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and
seeking damages, treble damages, restitution, interest and attorneys’ fees, all in unspecified
amounts,

State of Connecticut v. McKesson Corporation,

(Civil Action No. 1:08-CV-10900-PBS)
(“Connecticut Action”). On January 13, 2009, an amended complaint was filed in the Connecticut
Action abandoning all previously alleged antitrust claims.

On October 15, 2010, the Company executed an agreement to settle the Connecticut Action for
$26 million. The settlement, which was not subject to court approval, includes an express denial of
liability and a release by the State of Connecticut of the Company as to all matters alleged or
which could have been alleged in the action. As a result, during the second quarter of 2011, the
Company recorded a $24 million pre-tax charge. On November 8, 2010, the Court entered a Notice of
Dismissal with prejudice in the Connecticut Action pursuant to the October 15 settlement agreement.
The Connecticut Action has thus concluded.

The Douglas County, Kansas Nationwide Class Action

On August 7, 2008, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts by the Board of County Commissioners of Douglas County, Kansas on behalf of itself
and a purported national class of state, local and territorial governmental entities against the
Company and FDB alleging violations of civil RICO and federal antitrust laws and seeking damages
and treble damages, as well as injunctive relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs of suit, all
in unspecified amounts,

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Separate class actions based on essentially the same factual allegations were subsequently
filed against the Company and FDB in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts by the City of Panama City, Florida on August 18, 2008 (“Florida Action”), the State
of Oklahoma on October 15, 2008 (“Oklahoma Action”), the County of Anoka, Minnesota on November 3,
2008 (“Minnesota Action”), Baltimore, Maryland on November 7, 2008 (“Maryland Action”), Columbia,
South Carolina on December 12, 2008 (“South Carolina Action”) and Goldsboro, North Carolina on
December 15, 2008 (“North Carolina Action”) in each case on behalf of the filing entity and a class
of state and local governmental entities within the same state, alleging violations of civil RICO,
federal and state antitrust laws and various state consumer protection and deceptive and unfair
trade practices statutes and seeking damages and treble damages, civil penalties, as well as
injunctive relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts.

On December 24, 2008, an amended and consolidated class action complaint was filed in the
Douglas County, Kansas Action. The amended complaint added the named plaintiffs from the Florida,
Oklahoma, Minnesota, Maryland, South Carolina and North Carolina Actions and abandoned the
previously alleged antitrust claims. On January 9, 2009, the Florida, Oklahoma, Minnesota,
Maryland, South Carolina and North Carolina Actions were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.
On March 3, 2009, a second amended and consolidated class action complaint was filed in the Douglas
County, Kansas Action, adding the state of Montana as a plaintiff, adding Montana state law claims
and adding a claim for tortious interference.

On February 10, 2009, plaintiffs in the Douglas County, Kansas Action filed a notice of
dismissal without prejudice of defendant FDB. On April 2, 2009, the Company filed answers to each
of the pending complaints in the San Francisco Action, the Connecticut Action and the County of
Douglas, Kansas Action, denying the core factual allegations and asserting numerous affirmative
defenses. On April 9, 2009, the Company filed a demand for a jury in each of these actions.

On May 20, 2009, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts by Oakland County, Michigan and the City of Sterling Heights, Michigan against the
Company as the sole defendant, alleging violations of RICO, the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act, the
Michigan Consumer Protection Act, the California Cartwright Act and common law fraud and seeking
damages, treble damages, interest and attorneys’ fees, all in unspecified amounts,

Oakland County,
Michigan et al. v. McKesson Corporation

, (Civil Action No. 1:09-CV-10843-PBS) (“Michigan Action”).
On August 4, 2009, the court granted the Company’s motion to stay the Michigan Action.

On February 19, 2010, discovery closed in the consolidated public payer actions. On April 12,
2010, plaintiffs in the Douglas County, Kansas Action withdrew their motion to certify an opt-in
state Medicaid class. A hearing on the remaining classes in the Douglas County, Kansas and San
Francisco Actions was held on August 31, 2010.

On August 5, 2010, the court set a trial date of January 24, 2011, for the claims asserted by
the State of Oklahoma on behalf of its Medicaid program in the Douglas County, Kansas Action, or,
in the alternative, the claims asserted by the State of Montana on behalf of its Medicaid program
in the Douglas County, Kansas Action if the Oklahoma Medicaid claims were resolved before the final
pretrial conference, which the court scheduled for January 19, 2011. On December 2, 2010, the
Company executed a Memorandum of Understanding documenting an agreement in principle with the
States of Oklahoma and Montana to settle and release those States’ share of their Medicaid claims
in the Douglas County, Kansas Action subject to consent from the federal government not to seek any
portion of the settlement recovery. In light of the Memorandum of Understanding, on December 7,
2010, the Court vacated the previously reported trial date of January 24, 2011. On January 11,
2011, the court entered a settlement order of dismissal with respect to the Medicaid claims of
Oklahoma and Montana, subject to reopening of those actions if the settlement was not consummated
by April 11, 2011. On March 23, 2011, the court granted an unopposed motion filed by the States of
Oklahoma and Montana to extend the date on which their Medicaid claims would be dismissed.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

On March 4, 2011, the court entered an order granting in part, and denying in part,
plaintiffs’ motions for class certification in the Douglas County, Kansas Action and denying
plaintiff’s motion for class certification in the San Francisco Action. Specifically, the court
denied the San Francisco Health Plan’s motion to certify a class of governmental entities within
the State of California including the state of California itself. In the Douglas County, Kansas
Action, the court certified a nationwide class comprised of all non-federal and non-state
governmental entities for liability and equitable relief for the period from August 1, 2001, to
June 2, 2005, and for damages for the period August 1, 2001, to December 31, 2003.

On March 14, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration to extend the liability-only
class period from June 2, 2005, to September 26, 2009. On March 30, 2011, the court granted, in
part, plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration by extending the liability-only class period from June
2, 2005, to October 6, 2006.

On March 18, 2011, the Company filed a petition with the Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit seeking permission to appeal the district court’s March 4, 2011 class certification order
on the grounds that it improperly certified a damages class based on an aggregate damages model
that improperly included workers’ compensation programs. On March 31, 2011, plaintiffs filed an
answer in opposition to the Company’s petition as well as a cross-petition for review of the
district court’s decision to exclude all state entities from the certified class. The First
Circuit has not yet ruled on the parties’ petitions. No trial date is set in the San Francisco or
Douglas County, Kansas Actions.

B. State Medicaid AWP Cases

Beginning in September 2010, a series of suits were filed by individual states in
jurisdictions other than the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts based
on essentially the same factual allegations as alleged in

In re McKesson Governmental Entities
Average Wholesale Price Litigation

. A description of these actions is as follows:

The Kansas Action

On September 13, 2010, an action was filed in the Kansas state court of Wyandotte County by
the State of Kansas against the Company and FDB asserting claims under the Kansas Restraint of
Trade Act, the Kansas Consumer Protection Act, and the Kansas False Claims Act, and for civil
conspiracy, fraud, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract, and seeking damages and treble
damages, civil penalties, as well as injunctive relief, interest, disgorgement of profits,
attorneys’ fees and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts,

State of Kansas ex rel. Steve Six v.
McKesson Corporation, et al.

, (Case No. 10CV1491). On November 22, 2010, the Company filed a
motion to dismiss the Kansas Action. On February 24, 2011, the court denied the Company’s motion
to dismiss. The case is set for trial in August 2012.

The Mississippi Action

On October 8, 2010, an action was filed in the Mississippi state court of Hinds County by the
State of Mississippi against the Company asserting claims under RICO, the Mississippi Medicaid
Fraud Control Act, the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act, and for civil conspiracy, tortious

District Court, Southern District of Mississippi. On January 27, 2011, the case was remanded back
to Mississippi state court after the state dismissed its RICO claim. On February 15, 2011, the
Company filed a motion to transfer the Mississippi Action from the Circuit Court of Hinds County to
the Chancery Court of Hinds County, or in the alternative, to dismiss the State’s claim under the
Mississippi Consumer Protection Act for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court has
not yet ruled on the Company’s motion.

and treble damages, restitution, as well as injunctive relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs
of suit, all in unspecified amounts,

State of Utah v. McKesson Corporation, et al

., (Case No. CV
10-4743-SC). On December 22, 2010, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Utah Action, which

The Arizona Administrative Proceeding

On November 5, 2010, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Civil Monetary Penalty from the
Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (“AHCCCS”)
purporting to initiate an administrative claim process against the Company, and seeking civil
penalties in the amount of $101 million and an assessment in the amount of $112 million for false
claims allegedly presented to the Arizona Medicaid program, (Case No. 2010-1218).

On February 28, 2011, the Company filed a complaint in Arizona Superior Court, County of
Maricopa, against AHCCCS and its Director, alleging that the administrative proceeding commenced by
OIG violates the Arizona Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clauses of the Arizona
Constitution and the United States Constitution, and seeking to enjoin OIG’s administrative
proceeding, a declaratory judgment that AHCCCS lacks jurisdiction and legal authority to impose
penalties or assessments against the Company, as well as costs of suit,

McKesson Corporation v.
AHCCCS,

(Case No. CV-2011-004446). Also on February 28, 2011, the Company filed an application for
an interlocutory order staying, or alternatively dismissing, OIG’s administrative proceeding. On April 28, 2011, the trial court
ruled that AHCCCS has no jurisdiction to impose penalties or assessments against the
Company and enjoined AHCCCS from prosecuting or reinitiating any penalty proceeding against the Company.

The Hawaii Action

On December 20, 2010, an action was filed in Louisiana state court by the State of Louisiana
against the Company asserting claims under state unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes, the
Louisiana Medical Assistance Programs Integrity Law, state antitrust statutes, and for fraud,
negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment, seeking damages, statutory
fines, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, as well as interest, attorneys’ fees and costs of

State of Louisiana v. McKesson Corporation

, (Case No. C597634
Sec. 23). The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on March 7, 2011. A hearing on the
Company’s motion to dismiss is scheduled for May 9, 2011.

C. The New Jersey United States’ Attorney’s Office AWP Investigation

In June of 2007, the Company was informed that a qui tam action by an unknown relator was
previously filed in the United States District Court in the District of New Jersey, purportedly on
behalf of the United States, twelve states (California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia) and the District of
Columbia against the Company and seven other defendants. The Company has not been provided with the
original complaint, which was filed in 2005, and does not know the identity of the original parties
to the action. The Company was advised that the United States and the various states are
considering whether to intervene in the suit, but none has done so to date. The suit thus remains
under seal and has not been served on the Company.

In January 2009, the Company was provided with a courtesy copy of a third amended complaint
filed in the qui tam action. This complaint has also not been served on the Company. The third
amended complaint alleges multiple claims against the Company under the federal False Claims Act
and the various states’ and District of Columbia’s false claims statutes. These and additional
claims are also alleged against other parties. The claims arise out of alleged manipulation of AWP
by defendants which plaintiffs claim caused them to pay more than they should have in reimbursement
for prescription drugs covered by various government programs that base reimbursement payments on
AWP. The complaint is brought on behalf of the United States, the twelve states named above, ten
additional states (Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia and seeks damages including
treble damages and civil penalties (which the relator claims would be several billion dollars) as
provided under the various false claims act statutes, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.

As has also been previously reported regarding the New Jersey qui tam action, the United
States and various states have been considering whether to intervene in the suit, but none has done
so to date. The Company has at all times cooperated with these investigations, and has engaged in
settlement discussions with the purpose of resolving all Medicaid related AWP claims by the states
and federal government. The pace and progress of settlement discussions accelerated during and
after the third quarter of 2011. Except as previously reported with respect to the States of
Connecticut, Oklahoma and Montana, the Company has not reached agreement relating to those claims.

As previously reported, during the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $143 million to establish a reserve for estimated probable losses related to pending and
expected AWP claims by public payer entities. As of March 31, 2009 and 2010, the reserve relating
to AWP public entity claims was $143 million. The Company recorded an additional pre-tax charge of
$24 million for the settlement with the State of Connecticut during the second quarter of 2011. In
November 2010, a cash payment of $26 million was made for this settlement. Following the Company’s
most recent review of the reserve for estimated probable losses from current and possible future
public entity AWP claims, which review included consideration of the pace and progress of the above
described settlement discussions during and after the third quarter relating to state and federal
Medicaid claims, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $189 million within its Distribution
Solutions segment’s operating expenses during the third quarter of 2011. As of March 31, 2011, the
reserve relating to AWP public entity claims was $330 million and was included in other current
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. However, in view of the number of outstanding cases
and expected future claims, and the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of
litigation, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the
reserve.

II. Other Litigation and Claims

On April 7, 2010, an action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the
County of Los Angeles against, among others, the Company, its indirect subsidiary, NDCHealth
Corporation (“NDC”) and “Relay Health,” a trade name under which NDC conducts business,

Rodriguez
et al. v. Etreby Computer Company et al.,

(Civ. No. BC435303) (“Rodriguez”). The plaintiffs in
Rodriguez purport to represent a class of California residents whose individual confidential
medical information was allegedly illegally released and used by defendants. Plaintiffs also
purport to bring their claims as a private Attorney General action. The claims asserted in the
complaint against the Company defendants include negligence, statutory violations and violation of
California Business and Professions Code, Sections 17200

et seq

., covering unfair, unlawful and
fraudulent business acts and practices. The statutory violations alleged by plaintiffs purport to
arise out of California Civil Code, Sections 56 through 56.37, also known as the Confidentiality of
Medical Information Act (“CMIA”). The complaint seeks compensatory and statutory damages under the
CMIA, equitable and injunctive relief, as well as interest and attorneys’ fees and costs, all in
unspecified amounts. On May 10, 2010, defendants removed the action to United States District Court
for the Central District of California,

Rodriguez et al. v. Etreby Computer Company et al.

, (Civil
Action No. CV 10-3522-VBF). On June 10, 2010, the Company and NDC moved to dismiss the complaint on
grounds that it fails to allege the required element of knowledge by defendants, fails to allege
actual harm to any plaintiff and improperly names certain defendants, including the Company and
RelayHealth. On July 23, 2010, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss on grounds that
plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently plead any of their causes of action and gave plaintiffs until
August 9, 2010 to file an amended pleading. On December 9, 2010, the parties executed a settlement
agreement which, in consideration of payment by the Company of a non-material sum, resolves the
claims of all class members who do not affirmatively opt out of the class. On January 12, 2011, the
trial court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement, directing notice to
the class and setting a hearing for final approval of the settlement. The final approval hearing
is presently set to occur on June 27, 2011.

On October 3, 2008, the United States filed a complaint in intervention in a pending qui tam
action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, naming as
defendants, among others, the Company and its former indirect subsidiary, McKesson
Medical-Surgical MediNet Inc. (“MediNet”), now merged into and doing business as McKesson
Medical-Surgical MediMart Inc.,

United States ex rel. Jamison v. McKesson Corporation, et al.

,
 (Civil Action No. 2:08-CV-00214-SA). The United States (“USA”) alleges violations of the federal
False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Sections 3729-33, in connection with billing and supply services
rendered by MediNet to the long-term care facility operator co-defendants. The action seeks
monetary damages in an unstated amount. On July 7, 2009, defendants filed motions to dismiss the
action filed by the relator, arguing that the relator was not the original source of the claims
which he attempts to pursue in his qui tam action. On March 25, 2010, the trial court granted
defendants’ motions to dismiss the relator and his complaint, which ruling has been appealed by the
relator to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On June 2, 2010, the USA
filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking a finding that the Company’s co-defendant, a
Medicare Part B supplier, failed to comply with certain of the 21 Supplier Standards (“Standards”)
established by federal regulations covering such Medicare suppliers, and that the relevant claims
for which MediNet provided contract billing and/or supply services were rendered “false” by reason
of such non-compliance. On July 2, 2010 the Company and MediNet filed their opposition to the USA’s
motion and themselves moved for summary judgment as to certain counts based on numerous arguments,
including that the USA cannot, as a matter of law, establish that the co-defendant Medicare Part B
supplier failed to meet the Standards. On March 28, 2011, the trial court issued its order denying
the motion of the USA and granting the partial summary judgment motions of the Company and its
co-defendants on grounds that, as a matter of law, the Standards had not been violated. All causes
of action based on the alleged failure to comply with the Standards were dismissed. Discovery
regarding the balance of the USA’s allegations continues. Trial is presently set to commence on
February 6, 2012.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

On July 14, 2006, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York against McKesson, two McKesson employees, several other drug wholesalers and
numerous drug manufacturers,

RxUSA v. Alcon Laboratories et al.,

(Case No. 06-CV-3447-DRH).
Plaintiff alleges that the Company, along with various other defendants, unlawfully engaged in
monopolization and attempted monopolization of the sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products
in violation of the federal antitrust laws, as well as in violation of New York State’s Donnelly
Act. There are also alleged violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Donnelly Act and
Sections 1962 (c) and (d) of the federal civil RICO statute. Plaintiff alleges generally that
defendants have individually, and in concert with one another, taken actions to create and maintain
a monopoly and to exclude secondary wholesalers, such as the plaintiff, from the wholesale
pharmaceutical industry. The complaint seeks monetary damages of approximately $1.6 billion and
also seeks treble damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief. All defendants filed motions to
dismiss all claims. The motions were briefed and submitted to the trial court on March 13, 2007. On
September 24, 2009, the trial court issued its order granting “with prejudice” defendants’ motions
to dismiss and on September 28, 2009, the trial court entered judgment dismissing all of
plaintiff’s claims. On October 23, 2009, plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal in the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking reversal of the trial court’s orders of dismissal
and judgment. On August 30, 2010 the Court of Appeals affirmed the rulings of the trial court,
including the dismissal of plaintiff’s entire case with prejudice. The period for seeking an
appeal to the United States Supreme Court having expired, this matter has been concluded.

The Company is a defendant in approximately 305 cases alleging that the plaintiffs were
injured by Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory drug manufactured by Merck & Company (“Merck”). The cases
typically assert causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty and false
advertising for improper design, testing, manufacturing and warnings relating to the manufacture
and distribution of Vioxx. None of the cases involving the Company is scheduled for trial. The
Company has tendered each of these cases to Merck and has reached an agreement with Merck to defend
and indemnify the Company.

Our subsidiary, Northstar Rx LLC, is one of multiple defendants in approximately 350 cases
alleging that plaintiffs were injured after ingesting Reglan and/or its generic equivalent,
metoclopramide. The cases usually include claims for strict liability, failure to warn, negligence,
and breach of warranty. Most of these cases are pending in state courts in Pennsylvania, California
and New Jersey, with other cases pending in Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
Oregon and Tennessee. The first case involving Northstar Rx is set for trial in September 2011 in
Pennsylvania. Northstar Rx’s insurers are providing coverage for these cases. The Company is also
named in approximately 550 cases as a distributor of these products.

On September 15, 2010, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Wisconsin against the Company by Independent Pharmacy Cooperative, a Wisconsin based
cooperative purchasing organization for independent pharmacies, alleging that the Company has
breached, and continues to breach, a February 21, 2003, supply agreement between the parties,

Independent Pharmacy Cooperative, v. McKesson Corporation,

(Case No. 10-CV-00527 (BC)). In addition
to alleging breach of contract, plaintiff alleges breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing in connection with the supply agreement and intentional interference with contractual
relations between plaintiff and its members. In its complaint, plaintiff claims that the Company
has caused certain pharmacies to terminate their memberships in plaintiff’s cooperative and has
entered into separate agreements intended to cause members to terminate in the future. Plaintiff
seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages in an unspecified amount, punitive
damages, attorneys’ fees and costs of suit. On October 28, 2010 the Company filed a motion to
dismiss plaintiff’s intentional interference with contractual relations cause of action on grounds,
among others, that Wisconsin’s “economic loss” doctrine, which requires parties seeking economic
loss to pursue contract, not tort, claims, required dismissal of plaintiff’s interference claim as
a matter of law. On March 23, 2011 the court granted the Company’s motion and dismissed the
plaintiff’s interference cause of action based on the economic loss doctrine. On March 24, 2011
this action was dismissed “with prejudice” by stipulation of the parties and without any payment by
the Company.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

On January 4, 2011, the Company was served with a qui tam complaint that was originally filed
in November 2005 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by a
relator, a former employee of a Johnson & Johnson affiliate, against the Company, Johnson & Johnson
and its affiliate companies, and Omnicare, Inc., alleging that the Company engaged in conduct that
violated the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, causing subsequent claims for certain drugs
manufactured by Johnson & Johnson to be submitted in violation of the federal False Claims Act and
the false claims act statutes of various states,

United States ex rel. Scott Bartz v. Ortho McNeil
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al.,

(Case No. 2:05-cv-06010). The United States declined to intervene
in the suit, which alleges that the Company received illegal “kickbacks” from Johnson & Johnson
that were disguised as discounts and rebates. On February 23, 2011, the case was transferred to
the District of Massachusetts. The Company has not yet responded to the complaint.

In August of 2010, the Company was notified by the United States Attorneys’ Office in Kansas
City that a qui tam action had been filed on an unidentified date by two relators, a former
pharmacy customer of the Company and the customer’s advisor, in which the relators allege that in
or about January of 2006, the Company and a competitor drug wholesaler engaged in conduct that
violated the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, causing subsequent claims by the customer relator to be
submitted in violation of the federal False Claims Act, United States ex rel.

Saleaumua et al. v.
McKesson Corporation et al.,

(Case No. 4:08-CV-0848 (ODS)). The complaint alleges that the
defendants’ conduct prior to the Company’s losing the account to the competitor in January of 2006,
caused the customer relator to file subsequent claims in violation of the False Claims Act. The
complaint seeks monetary damages in an unspecified amount, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.
The complaint has not been served on the Company. On April 22, 2011, the Company was informed by
the United States Attorney’s Office that the Department of Justice had determined not to intervene
against McKesson and that the qui tam action would be dismissed.

III. Government Investigations and Subpoenas

From time-to-time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various
government agencies. The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a
cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require considerable time and
effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such subpoenas and
requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal
proceedings against the Company and other members of the health care industry, as well as to
settlements. In addition to the government investigations associated with the matters reported on
in

Other Litigation and Claims

above, examples of such requests and subpoenas include the
following: (1) the Company has responded to a request from the Federal Trade Commission for certain
documents as part of a non-public investigation to determine whether the Company may have engaged
in anti-competitive practices with other wholesale pharmaceutical distributors in order to limit
competition for provider customers seeking distribution services; (2) the Company has received and
responded to a Civil Investigative Demand from the Attorney General’s Office of the State of
Tennessee related to an investigation into possible violations of the Tennessee Medicaid False
Claims Act in connection with repackaged pharmaceuticals; (3) the Company has responded to a
subpoena from the office of the Attorney General of the State of New York requesting documents and
other information concerning its participation in the secondary or “alternative source” market for
pharmaceutical products; (4) the Company has responded to subpoenas and requests for information
from a number of Offices of state Attorney Generals or other state agencies, relating to the
pricing for branded and generic drugs; and (5) the Company has completed its response to a
subpoena, issued by the United States Attorney’s Office in Houston, which seeks documents relating
to billing and collection services performed by a Company subsidiary for certain healthcare
operations associated with the University of Texas from 2004 through the dates of the subpoenas,
which investigation the Company has been informed has been closed.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

As previously reported, on January 26, 2007, the Company acquired Per-Se Technologies, Inc.
(“Per-Se”), which became a wholly-owned subsidiary. Prior to its acquisition, Per-Se had publicly
disclosed that in December 2004, the SEC issued a formal order of investigation relating to
accounting matters at NDC, a then public company, which was acquired by Per-Se in January 2006,
prior to the Company’s acquisition of Per-Se. In March 2005, NDC restated its financial statements
for the fiscal years ended May 28, 2004, May 30, 2003 and May 31, 2002, and for the fiscal quarters
ended August 22, 2004, and August 29, 2005, to correct errors relating to certain accounting
matters. NDC produced documents to the SEC and fully cooperated with the SEC in its investigation.
The SEC has taken testimony from a number of current and former NDC employees. There has been no
activity in this matter for some time and the SEC has taken no action against NDC or its successor
to date.

Prior to its recent acquisition by the Company, US Oncology was informed that the United
States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Attorney General for the State of Texas had opened
investigations to determine whether a transaction in which certain Austin, Texas based oncology
physicians became employees of an existing Texas US Oncology affiliated oncology practice group
violated relevant state or federal antitrust laws. US Oncology has responded to requests for
information from the government agencies and the Company has continued to cooperate with the FTC
and the Texas Attorney General regarding these investigations.

IV. Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of the Company’s former chemical businesses, which were
fully divested by 1987, the Company is involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws
and regulations. The Company has received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to
investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged
to exist at eight sites where it, or entities acquired by it, formerly conducted operations and the
Company, by administrative order or otherwise, has agreed to take certain actions at those sites,
including soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, the Company is one of multiple recipients
of a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United
States Environmental Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages
(“NRD”) associated with one of these eight sites. Although the Company’s potential allocation under
either directive cannot be determined at this time, it has agreed to participate with a potentially
responsible party (“PRP”) group in the funding of an NRD assessment, the costs of which are
reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below.

Based on a determination by the Company’s environmental staff, in consultation with outside
environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of the Company’s probable loss
associated with the remediation costs for these eight sites is $7.5 million, net of approximately
$1.9 million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or is expected, based either on
agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties.
The $7.5 million is expected to be paid out between April 2011 and March 2031. The Company’s
estimated probable loss for these environmental matters has been entirely accrued for in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, the Company has been designated as a PRP under the Superfund law for
environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of its alleged disposal of hazardous
substances at 19 sites. With respect to these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been
designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability
upon PRPs, as a practical matter, costs of these sites are typically shared with other PRPs. The
Company’s estimated probable loss at those 19 sites is approximately $0.9 million, which has been
entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate settlements
and costs paid by the Company in Superfund matters to date have not been significant.

V. Other Matters

The Company is involved in various other litigation and governmental proceedings, not
described above, that arise in the normal course of business. While it is not possible to determine
with certainty the ultimate outcome or the duration of any such litigation or governmental
proceedings, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and the advice of counsel, that such
litigation and proceedings will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

18.  Stockholders’ Equity

Each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock is permitted one vote on proposals
presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the
Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). In May 2010, the quarterly dividend was raised from
$0.12 to $0.18 per common share. Dividends were
$0.72 per share in 2011 and $0.48 per share in 2010 and 2009. In April 2011, the Board
approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share,
applicable to ensuing quarterly dividend declarations. The
Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However,
the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will
depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other
factors.

Share Repurchase Plans

In April 2010, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of the
Company’s common stock and in October 2010, authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0
billion of the Company’s common stock. The Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to
$1.0 billion in April 2008. As of March 31, 2011, $500 million remained available for future
repurchases under the October 2010 authorization. In April 2011, the Board authorized the
repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. Stock repurchases may be
made from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through
accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing
of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors,
including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt
obligations and other market and economic conditions.

In May 2010, we entered into an ASR program with a third party financial institution to
repurchase $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. As a result of the ASR program, we
repurchased 12.7 million shares for $1.0 billion during the first quarter of 2011, which was funded
with cash on hand. The May 2010 ASR program was completed on July 26, 2010 and we received 1.9
million additional shares on July 29, 2010. The total number of shares repurchased under this
program was 14.6 million shares at an average price per share of $68.66.

In March 2011, we entered into another ASR program with a third party financial institution to
repurchase $275 million of the Company’s common stock. The program was funded with cash on hand.
As of March 31, 2011, we had received 3.1 million shares representing the minimum number of shares
due under the program. The ASR program was completed on May 2,
2011 and we received 0.4
million additional shares on May 5, 2011. The total number of shares repurchased under this ASR
program was 3.5 million shares at an average price per share of $79.65.

Total shares repurchased over the last three years were:

In July 2008, the Board authorized the retirement of shares of the Company’s common stock
that may be repurchased from time-to-time pursuant to its stock repurchase program. In 2009, 4
million repurchased shares for a total of $204 million, were formally retired by the Company. The
retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of
share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As
such, $165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.

19.  Related Party Balances and Transactions

Notes receivable outstanding from certain of our current and former officers and senior
managers totaled $15 million and $16 million at March 31, 2011 and 2010. These notes related to
purchases of common stock under our various employee stock purchase plans. The notes bear interest
at rates ranging from 4.7% to 7.1% and were due at various dates through February 2004. Interest
income on these notes is recognized only to the extent that cash is received. These notes, which
are included in other capital in the consolidated balance sheets, were issued for amounts equal to
the market value of the stock on the date of the purchase and are at full recourse to the borrower.
At March 31, 2011, the value of the underlying stock collateral was $14 million. The
collectability of these notes is evaluated on an ongoing basis. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, we
provided a reserve of approximately $1 million and $4 million for the outstanding notes.

We incurred $11 million in 2011 and 2010 and $10 million in 2009 of annual rental expense paid
to an equity-held investment.

20.  Segments of Business

We report our operations in two operating segments: McKesson Distribution Solutions and
McKesson Technology Solutions. The factors for determining the reportable segments included the
manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the
individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on
operating profit before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued operations.

The Distribution Solutions segment distributes ethical and proprietary drugs, medical-surgical
supplies and equipment and health and beauty care products throughout North America. This segment
also provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers,
sells financial, operational and clinical solutions for pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate
site) and provides consulting, outsourcing and other services. This segment includes a 49%
interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”), one of the leading pharmaceutical distributors in Mexico,
and a 39% interest in Parata, which sells automated pharmacy and supply management systems and
services to retail and institutional outpatient pharmacies.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The Technology Solutions segment delivers enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial,
supply chain, strategic management software solutions, pharmacy automation for hospitals, as well
as connectivity, outsourcing and other services, including remote hosting and managed services, to
healthcare organizations. This segment also includes our Payer group of businesses, which includes
our InterQual

®

clinical criteria solution, medical management tools, claims payment solutions and
care management programs. The segment’s customers include hospitals, physicians, homecare
providers, retail pharmacies and payers from North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other
European countries and Israel.

Revenues for our Technology Solutions segment are classified in one of three categories:
services, software and software systems and hardware. Services revenues primarily include fees
associated with installing our software and software systems, as well as revenues associated with
software maintenance and support, remote processing, disease and medical management, and other
outsourcing and professional services. Software and software systems revenues primarily include
revenues from licensing our software and software systems, including the segment’s clinical
auditing and compliance and InterQual

®

businesses.

Corporate includes expenses associated with Corporate functions and projects, certain employee
benefits and the results of certain equity-held investments. Corporate expenses are allocated to
the operating segments to the extent that these items can be directly attributable to the segment.

(2)

Represents options and RSUs awarded under the following plans: (i) 1994 Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Plan; (ii) 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral
Plan; and (iii) the 2005 Stock Plan

(3)

Represents 2,378,455 shares that remained available for purchase under the 2000 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and 13,431,887 shares available for grant under the 2005 Stock Plan.

(4)

Represents options and RSUs awarded under the following plans: (i) 1999 Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Plan; and (ii) the 1998 Canadian Stock Incentive Plan. No further awards
will be made under any of these plans.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by the Company’s
stockholders. The plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
except for the portion of the 2005 Stock Plan related to Non-Employee Directors, which is
administered by the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance.

2005 Stock Plan:

The 2005 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 25, 2005
and approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 27, 2005. The 2005 Stock Plan permits the
granting of up to 42.5 million shares in the form of stock options, restricted stock (“RS”), RSUs,
performance-based restricted stock units (“PeRSUs”) and other share-based awards. For any one
share of common stock issued in connection with a RS, RSU, PeRSU or other share-based award, two
shares shall be deducted from the shares available for future grants. Shares of common stock not
issued or delivered as a result of the net exercise of a stock option, shares used to pay the
withholding taxes related to a stock award or shares repurchased on the open market with proceeds
from the exercise of options shall not be returned to the reserve of shares available for issuance
under the 2005 Stock Plan.

Stock options are granted at no less than fair market value and those options granted under
the 2005 Stock Plan generally have a contractual term of seven years. Prior to 2005, stock options
typically had a contractual term of ten years. Options generally become exercisable in four equal
annual installments beginning one year after the grant date or after four years from the date of
grant. The vesting of RS or RSUs is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.
RS and RSUs generally vest over four years. Vesting of PeRSUs ranges from one to three-year
periods following the end of the performance period and may follow the graded or cliff method of
vesting.

Non-employee directors may be granted an award on the date of each annual meeting of the
stockholders for up to 5,000 RSUs, as determined by the Board. Such non-employee director award is
fully vested on the date of the grant.

1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan

. The 1997 Non-Employee
Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 30, 1997; however, stockholder approval
of the 2005 Stock Plan on July 27, 2005 had the effect of terminating the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan
such that no new awards would be granted under the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.

1994 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan.

The 1994 Stock
Option and Restricted Stock Plan expired by its terms on October 18, 2004, ten years after approval by the Board of Directors on October 19, 1994.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”):

The ESPP is intended to qualify as an
“employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. In
March 2002, the Board amended the ESPP to allow for participation in the plan by employees of
certain of the Company’s international and certain other subsidiaries. As to those employees, the
ESPP does not qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Currently, 16 million shares
have been approved by stockholders for issuance under the ESPP.



McKESSON CORPORATION

The ESPP is implemented through a continuous series of three-month purchase periods (“Purchase
Periods”) during which contributions can be made toward the purchase of common stock under the
plan.

Each eligible employee may elect to authorize regular payroll deductions during the next
succeeding Purchase Period, the amount of which may not exceed 15% of a participant’s compensation.
At the end of each Purchase Period, the funds withheld by each participant will be used to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of each share of the Company’s
common stock is based on 85% of the fair market value of each share on the last day of the
applicable Purchase Period. In general, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be
purchased by a participant for each calendar year is determined by dividing $25,000 by the fair
market value of one share of common stock on the offering date.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have not been submitted for approval by
the Company’s stockholders:

On July 27, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2005 Stock Plan which had the effect
of terminating the 1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, the 1998 Canadian Stock Incentive
Plan and certain 1999 one-time stock option plan awards, which plans had not been submitted for
approval by the Company’s stockholders, and, as noted above, the 1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation
and Deferral Plan, which had previously been approved by the Company’s stockholders. Prior grants
under these plans include stock options, RS and RSUs. Stock options under the terminated plans
generally have a ten-year life and vest over four years. RS contains certain restrictions on
transferability and may not be transferred until such restrictions lapse. Each of these plans has
outstanding equity grants, which are subject to the terms and conditions of their respective plans,
but no new grants will be made under these terminated plans.

Item 13.   Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence

Information with respect to certain transactions with management is incorporated by reference
from the Proxy Statement under the heading “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.”
Additional information regarding certain related party balances and transactions is included in the
Financial Review section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Financial Note 19, “Related Party
Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual
