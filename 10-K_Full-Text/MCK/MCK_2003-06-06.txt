Information Solutions

Our Information Solutions segment provides a comprehensive portfolio of
software, support and services to help healthcare organizations improve patient
safety, reduce the cost and variability of care, and better manage their
resources and revenue stream. The Information Solutions segment markets its
products and services to integrated delivery networks, hospitals, physician
group practices, home health providers, managed care providers and payors.
Approximately sixty percent of hospital-based integrated delivery networks in
the U.S. use one or more products from this segment. The segment also sells
its solutions internationally through subsidiaries and/or distribution



McKESSON CORPORATION

agreements in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.

The product portfolio for the Information Solutions segment is organized
into three major solutions sets – clinical management, revenue cycle management
and resource management – with a variety of subsets of these solutions designed
to address specific healthcare business issues (e.g., physician access,
medication safety, etc.). To ensure that organizations achieve the maximum
value for their information technology investment, the Information Solutions
segment also offers a wide range of services to support the implementation and
use of solutions as well as assist with business and clinical re-design,
process re-engineering and staffing (both information technology and
back-office).

Clinical management

. The segment’s clinical solutions are designed to
enable organizations to improve medication safety, accelerate physician
utilization of healthcare information technology and reduce variability in
healthcare quality and costs. The clinical management solution set, known as
Horizon Clinicals

TM

, is built using architecture to facilitate integration and
enable modular deployment of systems. It includes a clinical data repository,
document imaging, medical imaging, real-time decision support, point-of-care
nursing documentation, enterprise laboratory and pharmacy, an emergency
department solution and an ambulatory medical record. Horizon
Clinicals

TM

also
includes solutions to facilitate physician access to patient information such
as a Web-based physician portal and wireless devices that draw on information
from the hospital’s information systems.

Revenue cycle management

. The segment’s revenue cycle solution is
designed to reduce days in accounts receivable, prevent insurance claim
denials, reduce costs and improve productivity for our customers. Examples of
solutions include contract management, electronic claims processing and coding
compliance checking. The segment’s hospital information systems also play a
key role in revenue cycle management by working with these solutions to
automate the operation of individual departments and their respective functions
within the inpatient environment.

Resource management

. The segment’s resource management solutions consist
of an integrated suite of applications that enhance an organization’s ability
to forecast and optimize enterprisewide use of resources (labor, supplies,
equipment and facilities) associated with the delivery of care. These
solutions help automate and link resource requirements to care protocols
designed to increase profitability, enhance decision-making, and improve
business processes.

In addition to the product offerings described above, the segment offers a
comprehensive range of services to help organizations derive greater value
from, and enhance satisfaction and return on investment throughout the life of
the solutions implemented. The range of services includes:

Technology Services

. The segment has worked with numerous healthcare
organizations to support the smooth operation of their information systems by
providing the technical infrastructure designed to maximize application
accessibility, availability, security and performance.

Professional Services

. Professional services help customers achieve
business results from their software investment. The segment offers a wide
array of quality service options including consulting for business process
improvement and re-design, as well as implementation, project management,
technical, and education services relating to all products in the Information
Solutions segment.

Outsourcing Services

. The segment helps organizations focus their
resources where needed while the segment manages their information technology
or revenue cycle operations through outsourcing. Outsourcing service options
include managing hospital data processing operations, as well
as strategic information systems planning and management, revenue cycle
processes, payroll processing, business office administration, and major system
conversions.

Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures

We have undertaken strategic initiatives in recent years designed to
further focus on our core healthcare businesses and enhance our competitive
position. These initiatives are detailed in Financial Notes 2 and 3 to the
consolidated financial statements, “Acquisitions and Investments” and
“Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures,” appearing in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Competition

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Pharmaceutical
Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments face strong competition, both
in price and service, from national, regional and local full-line, short-line
and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, and
manufacturers engaged in direct distribution. In addition, these segments face
competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and
other healthcare manufacturers (as well as other potential customers of the
segments) which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal
needs, supply management capabilities which are provided by the segments and
other competing service providers. Price, quality of service, and, in some
cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive
elements in these segments.

Our Information Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from
many firms, including other computer services firms, consulting firms, shared
service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, hardware vendors and
internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry.
Competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical
coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.

Other Information About the Business

Customers

: In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth
has been with a limited number of large customers. During 2003, sales to our
largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, and ten largest customers accounted for
approximately 12% and 50% of our revenues. At March 31, 2003, accounts
receivable from Rite Aid Corporation and our ten largest customers were
approximately 10% and 43% of total accounts receivable. The majority of these
revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment.

Research and Development:

. Our research and development (“R&D”)
expenditures primarily consists of our investment in software development held
for sale. We expended $193.9 million, $183.1 million, and
$186.9 million for
R&D activities in 2003, 2002 and 2001 and of these amounts, we capitalized 23%,
26% and 21%. R&D expenditures are incurred by our Information
Solutions segment and our Medical Management and Automation businesses. Our
Information Solutions segment product development efforts apply computer
technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing
needs of hospitals. We believe a substantial and sustained commitment to such
expenditures is important to the long-term success of this business.
Additional



McKESSON CORPORATION

information regarding our R&D activities is included in Financial Note 1
to the consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting Policies,”
appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental Legislation

: We sold our chemical distribution operations in
1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations.
Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may
require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These
matters are described further in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Other than any capital expenditures that may be required
in connection with those legal matters, we do not anticipate making substantial
capital expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with
environmental laws and regulations in the future. The amount of our capital
expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2003 and is not
expected to be material in the next year.

Employees

: On March 31, 2003, we employed approximately 24,500 persons
compared to 24,000 in 2002 and 23,000 in 2001.

needs for the next several years without making capital expenditures materially
higher than historical levels. Information as to material lease commitments is
included in Financial Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, “Lease
Obligations,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

I.

Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by McKesson in April, May and July of 1999 that
McKesson had determined that certain software sales transactions in its
Information Solutions segment, formerly HBO & Company (“HBOC”) and now known as
McKesson Information Solutions, Inc., were improperly recorded as revenue and
reversed, as of April 29, 2003, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed against
McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or
directors, and other defendants, including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. (“Bear
Stearns”) and Arthur Andersen LLP (“Arthur Andersen”).

Federal Actions

Sixty-seven of the above mentioned actions have been filed in Federal
Court (the “Federal Actions”). All of the undismissed Federal Actions are
pending before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District
Court (the “Court”) for the Northern District of California. Federal Actions
filed as class actions (excluding the ERISA actions discussed below) have been
consolidated into a single action before Judge Whyte under the caption

In re
McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation

(Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the
“Consolidated Action”). As discussed below, some individual Federal Actions
are also pending before Judge Whyte. By order dated December 22, 1999, Judge
Whyte appointed the New York State Common Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff
(“Lead Plaintiff”) in the Consolidated Action and approved Lead Plaintiff’s
choice of counsel.

After the filing of three consolidated complaints and multiple motions by
multiple defendants challenging the sufficiency of those complaints, the
pleadings in the case have been set with respect to McKesson and HBOC
(motions for reconsideration of prior dismissal orders issued by Judge Whyte
have been filed by Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns and remain pending). The
operative complaint in the Consolidated Action is Lead Plaintiff’s Third
Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“TAC”), filed on February 15,
2002. The TAC asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under Sections 10(b)
and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) in
connection with the events leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May
and July 1999,



McKESSON CORPORATION

and names McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or
former officers or directors, Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns as defendants.
The Section 10(b) claim alleges that McKesson and HBOC intentionally or with
deliberate recklessness misstated the financial statements of HBOC or McKesson
during the class period. The Section 14(a) claim alleges that the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus issued in connection with a McKesson subsidiary and HBOC
merger (the “Merger”) contained material misstatements or omissions and that
McKesson was negligent in issuing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with
those misstatements. On April 5, 2002, McKesson filed a motion to dismiss Lead
Plaintiff’s claim under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act to the extent that it
is based on McKesson’s pre-Merger conduct (Lead Plaintiff’s claim under Section
10(b) against McKesson based on post-Merger conduct had already been sustained
by Judge Whyte), and moved to dismiss the claim under Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act in its entirety.

By order dated January 6, 2003, Judge Whyte granted in part and denied in
part the Company’s motion to dismiss the TAC. Specifically, Judge Whyte
dismissed with prejudice the claim against the Company under Section 10(b) of
the Exchange Act to the extent that claim was based on McKesson’s conduct or
statements prior to the January 12, 1999 merger transaction with HBOC, denied
the Company’s motion to dismiss the claim against the Company under Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act, and ordered the Company to answer the TAC.
Following the Court’s January 6, 2003 orders, the following claims remained
against McKesson and HBOC: (i) a claim against HBOC under Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act; (ii) a claim against McKesson under Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act with respect to post-Merger conduct only; and (iii) a Section 14(a) claim
against McKesson, as described in the Court’s January 6, 2003 order. The
Company and HBOC filed answers to the TAC on March 7, 2003, denying that the
Company or HBOC had violated Section 10(b) or Section 14(a) or that they had
any liability to the alleged plaintiff class.

On March 7, 2003, Lead Plaintiff filed a motion for class certification
seeking to certify a class consisting of (i) all persons and entities who
purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of HBOC during the
period from January 20, 1997, through and including January 12, 1999, (ii) all
persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded
securities or call options, or who sold put options, of McKesson during the
period from October 18, 1998 through and including April 27, 1999, and (iii)
all persons and entities who held McKesson common stock on November 27, 1998
and still held those shares on January 12, 1999. Lead Plaintiff seeks an order
appointing three representatives of this proposed class: (i) the Lead
Plaintiff; (ii) City of Miami Beach General Employees Retirement Trust; and
(iii) an individual investor named Donald Chiert. By agreement of the parties
(subject to approval by the Court), the Company will be required to respond to
Lead Plaintiff’s motion for class certification by August 22, 2003, and the
motion will be scheduled to be heard on October 3, 2003. McKesson and HBOC
have commenced the production of documents in the Consolidated Action and,
pursuant to pretrial orders, merits depositions may begin as early as mid-July
2003. No trial date has been set in the Consolidated Action.

On January 11, 2001, McKesson filed an action in the Court for the
Northern District of California against the Lead Plaintiff in the Consolidated
Action individually, and as a representative of a defendant class of former
HBOC shareholders who exchanged HBOC shares for Company shares in the January
12, 1999 Merger,

McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State Common Retirement Fund,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. C01-20021 RMW) (the “Complaint and Counterclaim”). In
the Complaint and Counterclaim, the Company alleges that the exchanged HBOC
shares were artificially inflated due to undisclosed accounting improprieties,
and that the exchange ratio therefore provided more shares to former HBOC
shareholders than would have otherwise been the case. In this action, the
Company seeks to recover the “unjust enrichment” received by those HBOC
shareholders who exchanged more than 20,000 HBOC shares in the Merger. The
Company does not allege any wrongdoing by these shareholders. On January 9,
2002, Judge Whyte dismissed the Complaint and Counterclaim with prejudice. The
Company appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”). The Company’s appeal was heard by the Ninth
Circuit on April 8, 2003. The Ninth Circuit has not yet issued an opinion.

By order dated February 7, 2000, Judge Whyte coordinated with the
Consolidated Action a class action alleging claims under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (commonly known as “ERISA”),

Chang v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-00-20030 RMW), and a shareholder derivative
action that had been filed in the Northern District of California under the
caption

Cohen v. McCall et al.

(Case No. C-99-20916 RMW) with the Consolidated
Action. There has been no further significant activity in the Cohen action.
By stipulated order dated April 30, 2003, no defendant or nominal defendant is
required to respond to the complaint until notified by the plaintiff in writing
with thirty days notice or upon further order of the Court. Recent
developments in the Chang action are discussed below.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Several individual actions have also been filed in, or transferred to, the
Northern District of California. On November 12, 1999, an individual
shareholder action was filed in the Court for the Northern District of
California under the caption

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(C-99-21192
RMW). The Plaintiffs in Jacobs are former HBOC shareholders who acquired their
HBOC shares pursuant to a registration statement issued by HBOC prior to the
Merger, and then exchanged their HBOC shares for McKesson shares in the Merger.
Plaintiffs in Jacobs assert claims under federal and state securities laws and
a claim for common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages, and costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. Judge Whyte’s
December 22, 1999, order consolidated the Jacobs action with the Consolidated
Action. With leave of court, the Jacobs plaintiffs amended their complaint,
but the action remains stayed and there has been no discovery, motion practice
or other activity in the case. On September 21, 2000 the plaintiffs in

Jacobs
v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

filed a new individual action entitled

Jacobs v. HBO &
Company

(Case No. C-00-20974 RMW). The Jacobs complaint names only HBOC as a
defendant and asserts claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act,
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and various state law causes of action. The
complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and costs of
suit, including attorneys’ fees. This action has been assigned to Judge Whyte
and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On December 16, 1999, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Bea v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al

. (Case No. C-00-20072 RMW). Plaintiffs in Bea filed an Amended Complaint
on March 9, 2000. Plaintiffs in Bea allege that they acquired the Company’s
common stock prior to the Merger and sold that stock after the April 1999
announcement at a loss. The Bea complaint asserts claims under the federal and
state securities laws, and a claim for fraud. Plaintiffs seek (i) unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, and (ii) reasonable costs and expenses of
suit, including attorneys’ fees. Bea is currently stayed and has been
consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On January 7, 2000, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Cater v. McKesson Corporation
et al.

(Case No. C-00-20327 RMW). The plaintiff is Terry Cater, a former
employee of the Company who alleges that his options and restricted stock were
substantially devalued as a result of the Merger and the subsequent drop in the
Company’s stock price. Plaintiff in Cater asserts claims under the federal
securities laws as well as claims for breach of good faith and fair dealing,
fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Plaintiff seeks (i) unspecified special
damages in excess of $50,000, (ii) unspecified general damages, (iii)
prejudgment interest and (iv) reasonable attorneys’ fees. The case has been
assigned to Judge Whyte and the parties have stipulated to a stay pending the
outcome of the motions to dismiss in the Consolidated Action.

On February 7, 2000, an action entitled

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al.

(Case No. CV 00-0188) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Louisiana. The same plaintiffs then filed a virtually identical
parallel action in Louisiana State Court, Rapides Parish, under the caption

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al

(filed as Case No. 199018; Case No.
CV-00-0522 after removal to federal court). Plaintiffs, former shareholders of
Automatic Prescription Services, allege claims under the federal securities
laws, and claims for breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and
detrimental reliance. The state court action was removed to federal court and
the two Baker cases have been transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On July 27, 2001, an action was filed in the Court for the Northern
District of California captioned

Pacha, et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(Case No. C01-20713 PVT). The Pacha plaintiffs allege that they were
individual stockholders of McKesson stock on November 27, 1998, and assert that
McKesson and HBOC violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and that
McKesson, aided by HBOC, breached its fiduciary duties to plaintiffs by issuing
a joint proxy statement in connection with the Merger which allegedly contained
false and misleading statements or omissions. Plaintiffs name as defendants
McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of McKesson or
HBOC, Bear Stearns and Arthur Andersen. On November 13, 2001, Judge Whyte
ordered Pacha consolidated with the Consolidated Action and stayed all further
proceedings.

Hess v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

an action filed in state court in
Arizona (Case No. C-20003862) on behalf of former shareholders of Ephrata
Diamond Spring Water Company (“Ephrata”) who acquired McKesson shares in
exchange for their Ephrata stock when McKesson acquired Ephrata in January
1999, was removed to federal court, transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action. Judge Whyte also
stayed all further proceedings in Hess except for the filing of an amended
complaint, which was filed on or about December 15, 2001 (the “Hess Amended
Complaint”). The Hess Amended Complaint generally incorporates the allegations
and claims asserted in the Consolidated Action and also includes various common
law causes of action



McKESSON CORPORATION

relating to McKesson’s acquisition of Ephrata. The Company is not
currently required to respond to the Hess Amended Complaint.

On June 28, 2001, the Chang plaintiffs filed an amended ERISA class action
complaint against McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or
directors of McKesson or HBOC, and The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”). The
amended complaint in Chang generally alleges that the defendants breached their
ERISA fiduciary duties in connection with administering the McKesson HBOC
Profit Sharing Investment Plan (the “PSI Plan”) and the HBOC Profit Sharing and
Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”). Plaintiffs in Chang are former
employees of McKesson and participants in the PSI Plan, and purportedly seek
relief under sections 404-405, 409 and 502 of ERISA on behalf of a class
defined to include participants in the PSI Plan, including participants under
the HBOC Plan, who maintained an account balance under the PSI Plan as of April
27, 1999, who had not received a distribution from the PSI Plan as of April 27,
1999, and who suffered losses as a result of the alleged breaches of duty. On
October 12, 2001, McKesson, HBOC and Chase moved to dismiss the Chang action.
The outcome of that motion is discussed below.

On February 7, 2002, a related ERISA class action was filed in the Court
for the Northern District of California captioned

Adams v. McKesson Information
Solutions, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-02-06 85 JCS). Plaintiff in Adams filed a
first amended complaint on March 15, 2002, against HBOC, McKesson, the HBO &
Company Board of Directors, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Administrative Committee, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Investment Committee, McKesson HBOC, Inc. Profit Sharing Investment Plan (as a
nominal defendant only), and certain current or former officers, directors or
employees of McKesson or HBOC. Plaintiff alleges that he was a participant in
the HBOC Plan and generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC breached their ERISA
fiduciary duties to the HBOC Plan and its participants or engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiff asserts his claims on behalf of a
putative class defined to include all participants in the HBOC Plan and their
beneficiaries for whose benefit the HBOC Plan acquired HBOC stock from March
31, 1996 to April 1, 1999. Plaintiff seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and
HBOC breached their fiduciary duties, (ii) an order requiring defendants to
restore to the plan all losses caused by these purported breaches of fiduciary
duty, and (iii) reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses.

On June 3, 2002, Judge Whyte consolidated the Adams ERISA class action
with the Chang ERISA class action. By order dated September 30, 2002 Judge
Whyte dismissed the First Amended Complaint in the Chang action. Judge Whyte
granted plaintiffs in Chang and Adams 30 days leave to file a consolidated and
amended complaint under the caption

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. ERISA Litigation

(Northern District of California No. C-02-0685 RMW) (the “ERISA Action”). On
December 31, 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint (the
“CAC”) in the ERISA Action. The CAC generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC
breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA, and that HBOC engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiffs further allege that McKesson and
HBOC are liable under principles of

respondeat superior

and agency for alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties by other defendants. The CAC seeks to have the
defendants restore to the HBOC Plan and McKesson Plan losses allegedly caused
by their alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees,
costs and expenses. On February 28, 2003, McKesson filed a motion to dismiss
the CAC and HBOC filed motions to dismiss portions of the CAC. The parties
have agreed (subject to approval by the Court) that these motions will be heard
on August 29, 2003.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have also been filed in various state courts in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State
Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State Actions generally allege
misconduct by McKesson or HBOC (and others) in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements.

Two of the State Actions are derivative actions:

Ash, et al. v. McCall,
et al.

, (Case No. 17132), filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and

Mitchell v.
McCall et al.

(Case. No. 304415), filed in California Superior Court, City and
County of San Francisco. McKesson moved to dismiss both of these actions and
to stay the Mitchell action in favor of the earlier filed Ash and Cohen
derivative actions. Plaintiffs in Mitchell agreed to defer any action by the
court on McKesson’s motions pending resolution of McKesson’s dismissal motion
in Ash. On September 15, 2000, in the Ash case, the Court of Chancery
dismissed all causes of action with leave to re-plead certain of the dismissed
claims, and on January 22, 2001, the Ash plaintiffs filed a Third Amended
Complaint which is presently the subject of McKesson’s motion to dismiss.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Five of the State Actions are class actions. Three of these were filed in
the Delaware Court of Chancery:

Derdiger v. Tallman et al.

(Civil Action No.
17276),

Carroll v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 17454) and

Kelly v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Civil Action No. 17282). Two additional actions
were filed in the Delaware Superior Court:

Edmondson v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 99-951) and

Caravetta v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action
No. 00C-04-214 WTQ). The Carroll and Kelly actions have been voluntarily
dismissed without prejudice. McKesson removed Edmondson to federal court in
Delaware and filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the federal court
on March 5, 2002. McKesson filed motions to stay the Derdiger and Caravetta
actions in favor of proceedings in the federal Consolidated Action, which were
granted. On December 20, 2001, the plaintiff in Derdiger moved to vacate the
stay of that action. In a series of rulings dated September 9, 2002, October
11, 2002 and October 18, 2002, the court denied plaintiff’s motion to vacate
the stay with respect to any class claims but granted plaintiff leave to
proceed with his individual claims. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion
for partial summary judgment, and the former directors of Access Health, Inc.,
who are also defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the claims asserted against
them. The parties have asked the court to defer consideration of those motions
while they pursue settlement discussions.

Several of the State Actions are individual actions which have been filed
in various state courts. Five of these were filed in the California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco:

Yurick v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al.

(Case No. 303857),

The State of Oregon by and through the Oregon Public
Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 307619),

Utah State Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 311269),

Minnesota State Board of Investment v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
311747), and

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. CGC-02-405792). Oregon, Utah, and Minnesota and Merrill
Lynch have been consolidated before the Honorable Donald S. Mitchell under the
Oregon caption.

In Yurick, the trial court sustained McKesson’s demurrer to the original
complaint without leave to amend with respect to all causes of action except
plaintiffs’ claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation, which
remain in the case. On December 27, 2002, the Yurick action was assigned to
Judge Mitchell, the presiding judge in the Oregon, Minnesota, Utah and Merrill
Lynch actions.

The Oregon, Utah and Minnesota actions referenced above are individual
securities actions filed in the California Superior Court for the City and
County of San Francisco by the out-of-state pension funds for each of those
States and Colorado. On October 16, 2002, after motion practice to challenge
the sufficiency of the complaints in Utah, Minnesota and Oregon, which resulted
in the dismissal of a number of claims that had been asserted against McKesson
and HBOC, and the consolidation of those actions under the caption

The State of
Oregon Public Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Master
File No. 307619), plaintiffs in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah filed a consolidated
and amended complaint (the “CAAC”) which consolidated the remaining claims in
those actions. On October 11, 2002, plaintiffs in Merrill Lynch filed an
amended complaint in the Merrill Lynch action.

On March 13, 2003, Judge Mitchell overruled McKesson’s and HBOC’s
demurrers to and motions to strike the CAAC in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah. On
the same date, Judge Mitchell sustained in part and overruled in part McKesson
and HBOC’s demurrers, and denied McKesson and HBOC’s motions to strike the
amended complaint in Merrill Lynch. Following those orders, the following
claims remain against McKesson and HBOC in the consolidated Oregon action: (i)
under California law, for violation of California Corporations Code §
25000/25400, for violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200
(against HBOC only), and for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation,
and (ii) under Georgia law, claims for conspiracy under Georgia’s RICO statute,
and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, and aiding
and abetting. Following the Court’s March 13, 2003, orders, the following
claims remain against McKesson and HBOC in the Merrill Lynch action: (i) under
California law, for violation of California Corporations Code § 25000/25400,
for violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200 (against HBOC
only), and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy and
aiding and abetting, (ii) under New Jersey law, for conspiracy to violate New
Jersey’s RICO statute (HBOC only), and (iii) under Georgia law, for violation
of Georgia’s securities laws. The Court’s March 13, 2003, orders also gave the
Merrill Lynch plaintiffs leave to amend their previously-asserted claims
against McKesson for violation of New Jersey’s RICO statute and against
McKesson and HBOC for conspiracy to violate New Jersey’s and Georgia’s RICO
statutes. On April 8, 2003, the Merrill Lynch plaintiffs moved for
reconsideration of certain of Judge Mitchell’s March 13, 2003, orders,
including certain orders sustaining demurrers by McKesson and HBOC. Neither
McKesson nor HBOC is obligated to answer the CAAC or the complaint in the
Merrill Lynch action until after the court rules on the Merrill Lynch
plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Several individual actions have been filed in various state courts outside
of California. Several of these cases have been filed in Georgia state courts.
On December 9, 1999, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Gwinnett
County, under the caption

Adler v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
99-C-7980-3). Plaintiff in Adler, a former HBOC shareholder, asserted claims
for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance. The Adler action named as
defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. Plaintiff
sought damages in excess of $43 million, as well as punitive damages, and costs
of suit, including attorneys’ fees. The case was settled following discovery,
and plaintiff filed a Dismissal with Prejudice on July 17, 2002.

On October 24, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Suffolk Partners Limited Partnership et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 00VS010469A). Plaintiffs in the Suffolk action allegedly
purchased the Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999
announcement. Plaintiffs assert claims under Georgia’s securities and
racketeering laws, and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The Suffolk action names as defendants
the Company, HBOC, and certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, and Arthur Andersen. Like the Consolidated Action, the
claims in the Suffolk action generally arise out of the January 12, 1999
Merger, and the Company’s announcement of the need to restate its financial
statements. Plaintiffs seek (i) compensatory damages of approximately $21.8
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Company and HBOC separately answered the complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Suffolk
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. On August 2,
2001, the Court granted the motions to stay. Subsequently, however, in May
2003, the Court lifted the stay and directed the parties to coordinate
discovery with that in the Consolidated Action and several other actions. The
Company’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is set for hearing on June 18,
2003.

On November 1, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
00 VS 010801). Plaintiff in the Curran action allegedly purchased the
Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999 announcement.
The claims in the Curran action are identical to the claims in the Suffolk
action. Plaintiff seeks (i) compensatory damages of approximately $2.6
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Curran action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, and
certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and
Arthur Andersen. The Company and HBOC separately answered the Complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Curran
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. The Court
granted the motions to stay on August 22, 2001.

On December 12, 2001, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Drake v. McKesson Corp., et al.

(Case No. 01VS026303A).
Plaintiff in Drake is a former HBOC employee seeking lost commissions as well
as asserting claims under Georgia’s securities and racketeering laws, and
various common law causes of action. Plaintiff seeks (i) approximately
$300,000 in unpaid commissions, (ii) unspecified compensatory, consequential,
actual, exemplary, and punitive damages, and (iii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
The Drake action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and
Jay Gilbertson. The parties entered into a Consent Order for Partial Stay on
February 27, 2002, which stayed Plaintiff’s Georgia securities law, fraud and
RICO claims. On March 4, 2002, McKesson and McKesson Information Solutions
Inc. separately filed their answers. The case is in the discovery stage and is
proceeding on the plaintiff’s claims for unpaid commissions.

Two similar Georgia actions have been consolidated for purposes of
discovery and may be consolidated for purposes of trial. On January 31, 2002,
an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton County, under the caption

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v. McKesson, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
2002-CV-48407). Plaintiffs in the

Green

action are former HBOC shareholders.
Plaintiff Holcombe Green was also a former officer, chairman and director of
HBOC. On February 6, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court,
Fulton County, under the caption

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 2002-CV-48612). Plaintiff in the Hall action is a former
HBOC shareholder. One of the limited partners of the Hall Plaintiff is Nancy
Hall Green, the wife of Holcombe Green. The complaints in the Green and Hall
actions are substantially identical. In each action, Plaintiffs asserted
claims for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance and named as defendants
the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. In each action,
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $100 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’



McKESSON CORPORATION

fees. The Company and HBOC filed their respective answers and
counterclaims on April 22, 2002. HBOC also filed a third party complaint
against Holcombe Green for indemnification. The Company and HBOC also filed
motions to stay and dismiss. The court denied the motions to stay, and
partially granted the motions to dismiss, dismissing Plaintiffs’ claims for
fraudulent conveyance. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaims filed by
the Company and HBOC, and the Court denied those motions. Discovery is under
way and will proceed for some time.

On May 8, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton County,
under the caption

James Gilbert v. McKesson Corporation, et al.

(Case No.
02VS032502C). Plaintiff, formerly the general counsel of HBOC, alleges he was
a holder of options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock. The action
names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson.
Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages of approximately $2 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’ fees. On June 24, 2002, the Company and HBOC filed their respective
answers, motions to stay, and motions to dismiss. On November 26, 2002, the
court granted the motions to stay, and this case is stayed until final
disposition of the Consolidated Action.

On September 28, 1999, an action was filed in the Delaware Superior Court
under the caption

Kelly v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et. al.

(Civil Action No.
99C-09-265 WCC). Plaintiffs in Kelly are former shareholders of KWS&P, Inc.
and KWS&P/SFA, Inc., which companies were acquired by McKesson in 1999. The
plaintiffs assert claims under the federal securities laws as well as claims
for breach of contract. On January 17, 2002, the court denied McKesson’s
motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary
judgment, while granting motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction
that were filed by certain former officers and directors of McKesson and HBOC.
As of May 30, 2003, the parties have agreed to a settlement of this action, and
the case will be dismissed with prejudice.

The
United States Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) and the SEC are conducting
investigations into the matters leading to the restatement. On May 15, 2000,
the USAO filed a one-count information against
former HBOC officer, Dominick DeRosa, charging Mr. DeRosa with aiding and
abetting securities fraud, and on May 15, 2000, Mr. DeRosa entered a guilty
plea to that charge. On September 28, 2000, an indictment was unsealed in the
Northern District of California against former HBOC officer, Jay P. Gilbertson,
and former Company and HBOC officer, Albert J. Bergonzi,

United States v.
Bergonzi, et al.

(Case No. CR-00-0505). On that same date, a civil complaint
was filed by the SEC against Mr. Gilbertson, Mr. Bergonzi and Mr. DeRosa

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gilbertson, et al.

(Case No. C-00-3570).
Mr. DeRosa has settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the
substantive allegations of the complaint. On January 10, 2001, the grand jury
returned a superseding indictment in the Northern District of California
against Messrs. Gilbertson and Bergonzi

United States v. Bergonzi, et al.

(Case
No. CR-00-0505) and on June 4, 2003, a second superseding
indictment was unsealed which added new charges against
Mr. Bergonzi and which also charged both former Chairman of the
Board of HBOC and the Company, Charles W. McCall, and former HBOC
General Counsel, Jay Lapine, with various securities law violations.
Also on June 4, 2003, the USAO announced the filing of
agreements with Messrs. Gilbertson, DeRosa and former Senior
Vice President for Finance, Timothy Heyerdahl to plead guilty to
various securities law violations (Case Nos. CR-00-0505,
CR-00-0213 and CR-01-0002, respectively).

On September 27, 2001, the SEC filed securities fraud charges
against six former HBOC officers and employees including
Messrs. Heyerdahl and Lapine. Simultaneous with the filing
of the Commission’s civil complaints, four of the six defendants settled the
claims brought against them by, among other things, consenting, without
admitting or denying the allegations of the complaints, to entry of permanent
injunctions against all of the alleged violations, and agreed to pay civil
penalties in various amounts. On June 4, 2003, the SEC filed a
civil complaint against Mr. McCall for various securities law
violations (Case No. C-03-2603). On January 3, 2002, the Company was notified in
writing by the SEC that its investigation has been terminated as to the
Company, and that no enforcement action has been recommended to the Commission.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings, or to estimate the amounts
of, or potential range of, loss with respect to those proceedings. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain.
The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments
against the Company or settlements that could require substantial payments by
the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigation and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for product liability and other damages, investigations relating to
governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal
conduct of our business. These include:



McKESSON CORPORATION

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc., is one of many defendants
in approximately 110 cases in which plaintiffs claim that they were injured due
to exposure, over many years, to latex proteins in gloves manufactured by
numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors, including
McKesson Medical-Surgical. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its
suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major
suppliers. McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc.’s insurers are providing coverage
for these cases, subject to applicable deductibles.

We, along with more than 100 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit
brought in 2000 by the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (“the
Foundation”) alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven U.S.
patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the
automated management and control of product inventory, warehousing,
distribution and point-of-sale transactions. Due to the pendency of earlier
litigation brought against the Foundation by the manufacturers of bar code
devices attacking the validity of the patents at issue, the court stayed the
suit against us until the conclusion of the earlier case, including any appeals
that may be taken. The trial in this earlier case concluded in January 2003
and the parties are awaiting the decision. An appeal is
anticipated regardless of the outcome. While the suit against us was stayed,
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petitions for reexamination of
three of the seven patents asserted by the Foundation against us. The
reexamination will determine, among other things, whether these patents have
expired. Each of the remaining four patents in the action has already expired
by its own terms, or by the Foundation’s disclaiming the remaining portion of
the patent’s life.

We, through our former McKesson Chemical Company division (the “Former
Division”), have been named a defendant in 52 cases filed in state courts in
Mississippi as a result of the Former Division’s alleged distribution of
asbestos. These cases typically involve multiple plaintiffs claiming personal
injuries and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against numerous
defendants arising from the plaintiffs’ alleged exposure to asbestos-containing
materials. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into at the time of the
1986 sale of McKesson Chemical Company to what is now called Univar USA Inc.
(“Univar”), we have tendered each of these actions to Univar. Univar is
currently defending us but has raised questions concerning the extent of its
obligations under the indemnification agreement. Discussions with Univar on
that subject are ongoing. McKesson has not paid or incurred any costs or
expenses in connection with these actions to date; and the Company continues to
look to Univar for defense and full indemnification of these claims. In
addition, McKesson believes that, if necessary, a portion of these claims would
be covered by insurance.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois
is conducting an industry-wide civil and criminal investigation into the
marketing, sale and Medicare reimbursement of enteral nutritional products
(“Products”) and has indicated that the Company and two of our employees are
subjects of the investigation. The Products are sold, and the individuals are
employed by the extended care business conducted by McKesson Medical-Surgical
Minnesota Supply Inc., an indirect subsidiary of the Company. We are
cooperating with the investigation and responding to subpoenas which have been
issued to the Company.

Environmental Matters

Primarily
as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses,
which were fully divested by 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations. We have received claims and demands from
governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly
required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at five sites
where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations; and we, by
administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain actions at those
sites, including soil and groundwater remediation.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with
outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of
reasonably possible remediation costs for these five sites is approximately $12
million, net of approximately $2 million that third parties have agreed to
pay in settlement or we expect, based either on agreements or
nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third
parties. The $12 million is expected to be paid out between April 2003 and
March 2028. Our liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a potentially responsible party,
or PRP, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law or its state law



McKESSON CORPORATION

equivalent) for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result
of our alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 22 sites. With respect to
each of these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and,
while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several
liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically
shared with other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 22 sites is
approximately $1.3 million. The aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in
Superfund matters to date have not been significant. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain
due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup
costs; the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportions to other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs are
recoverable from insurance or other parties.

While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the
ultimate outcome of any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed
under this section II, “Other Litigation and Claims,” we believe, based on
current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that such litigation and
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

table above.



McKESSON CORPORATION

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by
the Company’s stockholders. The plans are administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, except for the Directors’ Plan (defined
below) which is administered by the Committee on Directors and Corporate
Governance.

1994 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “1994 Plan”)

: The 1994
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in 1994 and provides for the grant
of approximately 41.2 million shares, which includes awards granted under
predecessor plans, in the form of nonqualified stock options or incentive stock
options (“ISOs”), as defined under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code
(“the Code”), with or without tandem stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), or
restricted stock. Options granted under the 1994 Plan are generally subject to
the same terms and conditions as those granted under the 1999 Plan, discussed
below, except that under the 1994 Plan only executive officers of the Company
are eligible to receive option grants.

1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan (the
“Directors’ Plan”)

: The Directors’ Plan was adopted in 1997 and provides for
the grant of approximately 1.3 million shares in the form of nonqualified stock
options or restricted stock units to non-employee directors of the Company.
Shares subject to option grants which cease to be exercisable shall not be
counted against the number of shares available under the Directors’ Plan.
Restricted stock units (described below), whether or not distributed in the
form of restricted stock, will be counted against the number of shares
available.

Under the Director’s Plan, each director receives an annual stock option
grant (“Annual Grants”) of 7,500 option shares. In addition, each director is
required to defer 50% of his or her annual retainer into either Restricted
Stock Units (“RSUs”) or nonqualified stock options (“Retainer Options”), and
may also elect to defer the remaining 50% of the annual retainer into RSUs or
Retainer Options or the Company’s deferred compensation administration plan
(DCAP II), or may elect to receive cash. Meeting fees and Committee Chair
annual retainers may be deferred into RSUs or DCAP II or may be paid in cash.

Both Annual Grants and Retainer Options are granted at not less than fair
market value on the date of grant. The number of Retainer Options granted or
RSU’s credited is determined based on defined formulas. Both Annual Grants and
Retainer Options have a term of ten years. Retainer Options granted prior to
May 29, 2002 and all Annual Grants fully vest one year from date of grant.
Retainer Options granted on or after May 29, 2002 are immediately vested upon
grant. Each RSU entitles the holder, upon distribution, to receive one share
of common stock or a cash payment equal to either the fair market value of one
share of common stock. RSUs terminate upon the occurrence of a change of
control, whereby common stock to be issued in respect of all RSUs will be
immediately distributed.

1973 Stock Purchase Plan (the “SPP”):

The SPP was adopted by the
stockholders of the Company’s predecessor in 1973. The Company’s stockholders
approved an additional 2.5 million shares to be issued under the SPP in 1999,
which remain available for issuance under the SPP. Rights to purchase shares
are granted under the SPP to key employees of the Company as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board. Members of the Committee are not eligible
to receive awards under the SPP. The purchase price to be paid in cash or
using promissory notes of the Company common stock subject to rights granted
under the SPP is the fair market value of such stock on the date the right is
exercised.

2000 ESPP:

The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase
plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. In March 2002, the Board
amended the ESPP to allow for participation in the plan by employees of certain
of the Company’s international and other subsidiaries. As to those employees,
the ESPP does not so qualify. Currently, 11.1 million shares have been
authorized for issuance under the ESPP.

The ESPP is implemented through a continuous series of 24-month offerings
beginning on the first trading day on or after each May 1 and November 1 (the
“Offering Dates”) and ending on the last trading day of the month which is 24
months later (the “Offering Periods”) and six-month periods beginning on each
May 1 and November 1 and ending on the following October 31 and April 30,
during which contributions may be made toward the purchase of common stock
under the plan (“Purchase Periods”).

Each eligible employee may elect, at least ten days prior to any Offering
Date, to authorize regular payroll deductions during the next succeeding
Purchase Period, the amount of which may not exceed 15% of a participant’s
compensation. At the end of each Purchase Period, the funds withheld by each
participant will be used to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The
purchase price of each share of the Company’s common stock will be the lesser
of (i) 85% of the fair market value of such share on the first day of the
Offering Period; or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of such share on the last
day of the applicable Purchase Period. In general, the maximum number



McKESSON CORPORATION

of shares of common stock that may be purchased by a participant for each
Purchase Period is determined by dividing $12,500 by the fair market value of
one share of common stock on the Offering Date.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have not been
submitted for approval by the Company’s stockholders:

1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “Plan

”): The Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors in 1999. The Plan provides for the grant of
45.2 million shares in the form of nonqualified stock options, with or without
SARs or restricted stock. Shares subject to option grants which cease to be
exercisable continue to be available for subsequent option grants. Options may
be granted under the Plan to eligible employees of the Company. No executive
officers or directors participate in this Plan.

Options are granted at not less than fair market value and have a term of
ten years. Options generally become exercisable in four equal annual
installments beginning one year after the grant date, or after four years from
the date of grant. Restricted stock granted under the Plan contains certain
restrictions on transferability and may not be transferred until such
restrictions lapse. Such shares will be forfeited if the grantee’s continuous
employment with the Company is terminated (except as provided in the Plan or in
the agreement evidencing the restricted stock award) prior to the lapsing of
the restrictions (generally two to four years) or if performance goals set
forth as a condition to the lapsing of restrictions has not been attained.
Grantees may elect to use stock to satisfy any withholding tax obligation upon
the lapsing of restrictions on restricted stock awards. Both options and
restricted stock awards are subject to special rules regarding forfeiture in
situations when a participant engages in actions specified as being detrimental
to the Company. The Plan also provides that outstanding options become
immediately exercisable and the restrictions on restricted stock awards
immediately lapse upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company.

1998 Canadian Stock Incentive Plan (the “Canadian Plan”):

The Canadian
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in January 1998, following the
Company’s acquisition of a Canadian company, to provide nonqualified stock
options, with or without tandem SARs, to eligible employees of the Canadian
company. The Canadian Plan has subsequently been amended to allow for the
grant of stock options to employees of any of the Company’s Canadian
subsidiaries. A total of 0.9 million shares have been authorized for issuance
under the Canadian Plan. Options granted under the Canadian Plan are generally
subject to the same terms and conditions as those granted under the 1999 Plan,
discussed above, except that (i) options may be granted for less than the fair
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and (ii) all
options will become immediately exercisable upon an employee’s disability or
death and must be exercised within three years of such date.

Stock Option Plans Adopted in January 1999 and August 1999

: On January 27,
1999 and August 25, 1999 the Board of Directors adopted certain stock option
plans (the “January 1999 Plan” and the “August 1999 Plan”, or together the
“Plans”) to provide stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common
stock to eligible employees of the Company. A maximum of 5.2 million and 5.8
million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the January
1999 and August 1999 Plans. In each case the Plans state that: (i) under each
of the Plans no single officer or director of the Company or any subsidiary
could acquire more than 1% of the Company’s common stock outstanding at the
time the Plans were adopted, and (ii) each of the Plans, together with all stock
option or purchase plans, or any other arrangements pursuant to which officers
or directors of the Company may acquire common stock (other than stock plans
for which stockholder approval is not required under Section 312.03 of the NYSE
Rules), does not authorize the issuance of more than 5% of the Company’s common
stock outstanding at the time the Plans were adopted (collectively the “NYSE
Limits”). Options were granted under each of the Plans to eligible employees
of the Company. No further grants will be made from either of the Plans.

Options are granted at not less than fair market value and have a term of
ten years. Under the January 1999 Plan, the option generally becomes
exercisable over four years, with the first 50% occurring two years following
grant, and 25% each vesting on the third and fourth anniversary of the grant
date. Under the August 1999 Plan, options generally become exercisable in four
equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date, or after
four years from the date of grant.

The Plans provide that outstanding options become fully vested and
immediately exercisable upon the occurrence of the optionee’s death, long-term
disability, retirement (subject to certain conditions) or a change of control
of the Company. In addition, awards made under the Plans are subject to
special rules regarding forfeiture in situations when a participant engages in
actions deemed to be detrimental to the Company, as specified in the Statement
of Terms & Conditions for the Plans.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Restricted Stock Plan Adopted in January 2000 (the “January 2000 Plan”)

:
On January 31, 2000 the Board of Directors adopted the January 2000 Plan, a restricted stock
plan, to make grants of restricted stock to eligible employees of the Company.
A maximum of 0.5 million shares of common stock was authorized for issuance
under the January 2000 Plan. No further grants will be made from the January
2000 Plan.

Restricted stock granted under the January 2000 Plan contain certain
restrictions on transferability and may not be transferred until such
restrictions lapse (generally four years). Such shares will be forfeited if
the grantee’s continuous employment with the Company is terminated, except as
provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the restricted stock, prior
to the lapsing of the restrictions. If a grantee’s employment with the Company
terminates as a result of his or her death, disability or retirement (subject
to certain conditions), the restrictions on restricted stock awards shall lapse
upon the date of such termination. In addition, awards under the January 2000
Plan are subject to special rules regarding forfeiture in situations when a
participant engages in actions specified as being detrimental to the Company.

1999 Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999 SPP”):

The 1999 SPP was
adopted by the Board of Directors in February 1999. The 1999 SPP provided for
the grant of rights to purchase a maximum of 0.7 million shares of common stock
subject to the NYSE Limits. No further grants will be made from the 1999 SPP.
Rights to purchase shares were granted under the 1999 SPP to eligible employees
of the Company. Non-employee directors were not permitted to participate in
the Plan. The purchase price to be paid in cash or using promissory notes of
the Company common stock subject to rights granted under the 1999 SPP was equal
to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date the right
was exercised (which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the
NYSE). Purchases were evidenced by written stock purchase agreements which
provide for the payment of the purchase price by (i) payment in cash, or (ii) a
promissory note payable on a repayment schedule determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).

HBOC 1994 UK Sharesave Scheme (the “1994 Scheme”):

In connection with the
acquisition by the Company of HBOC, we assumed the HBOC 1994 Scheme which is
similar to the ESPP, under which 228,108 shares remain available for issuance.
Employees and previous directors of HBOC and its subsidiaries, who are
residents of the United Kingdom, are eligible to receive options under the 1994
Scheme. The exercise price of the stock covered by each option shall not be
less than 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the
date the option is granted. Participants under the 1994 Scheme pay for options
through monthly contributions, subject to minimum and maximum monthly limits.
If, after three years from the date an option was granted to a participant, the
participant is terminated by reason of his or her death, disability,
retirement, change of control or any other reason other than for cause, the
participant may exercise the option for a period of three years.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Information with respect to certain transactions with management is
incorporated by reference from the Proxy Statement. Additional information
regarding related party transactions is included in the Financial Review
section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Financial
Note 20, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to
the consolidated financial statements.

Item 14.

Controls and Procedures

Within the 90-day period prior to the filing of this report, the Company’s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that it records, processes, summarizes and reports in a timely manner
the information the Company must disclose in its reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of the date of that evaluation. In addition, there have been no
significant changes in the Company’s internal controls, or in factors that
could significantly affect internal controls, subsequent to the date the
Company’s management completed their evaluation.

It should be noted that a control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. As a result, there can be no assurance that a
control system will succeed in preventing all possible instances of
error and fraud.

Segment operating profit includes gross profit, net of operating
expenses, other income and gain (loss) on investments for our three
business segments.

Revenues increased 14% to $57.1 billion in 2003 and 19% to $50.0 billion
in 2002. Net income increased $136.8 million to $555.4 million in 2003 and
$466.9 million to $418.6 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share increased
$0.45 to $1.88 in 2003 and $1.60 to $1.43 in 2002. Excluding the items noted
below which were included in income from continuing operations, increases in
operating profit, net income and earnings per share over the past two years
primarily reflect revenue growth and operating margin expansion in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and improved operating profit in our
Information Solutions segment. The increases were partially offset by a
decline in operating profit in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment in 2002.

Results from continuing operations included the following significant items:

—

In 2003, we recorded a $51.0 million provision for expected losses on
five multi-year international contracts and a $22.3 million credit for
the reversal of a portion of customer settlement reserves within our
Information Solutions segment.

—

In 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $39.8 million associated
with various consolidation plans and $22.0 million in pre-tax losses
($22.0 million after-tax gain) on the sale of three businesses.

—

In 2001, we recorded $97.8 million of other-than-temporary investment
losses primarily related to the decline in fair value of our WebMD
Inc. (“WebMD”) warrants, a $161.1 million charge for estimated
customer settlements, and $194.8 million in restructuring charges
primarily related to the discontinuance of our former iMcKesson
segment. Results for 2001 also include $49.4 million of goodwill
amortization. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” we discontinued amortizing goodwill commencing in 2002.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2003, we sold a marketing fulfillment business which was previously
included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Financial results for this
business have been reclassified and presented as a discontinued operation. Net
losses from this discontinued operation as well as adjustments relating to the
2000 divestiture of our Water Products business amounted to $6.7 million ($0.02
per diluted share) in 2003, $3.2 million ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2002, and
$5.0 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2001.

Revenues:

Revenues increased 14% in 2003 and 19% in 2002. Excluding sales to
customers’ warehouses, revenues increased 15% in 2003 and 18% in 2002. The
growth in revenues was primarily driven by the Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment, which accounted for more than 90% of revenues. Excluding sales to
customers’ warehouses, Pharmaceutical Solutions segment revenues increased 16%
in 2003 compared to 20% in 2002. Revenues were not materially impacted by
business acquisitions.

We believe that we have achieved this increase in sales volume due in
large part to the wide range of products and services that we offer our
customers from across the company using our One McKesson approach. Our retail
customers have benefited from our service offerings and programs that focus on
broad product selection, service levels, inventory carrying cost reductions,
connectivity and automation technologies. Institutional customers have
benefited from our focus on reducing both their product cost and internal labor
and logistics costs, as well as automation and information technologies that
are designed to improve the quality of care. Services available include
pharmaceutical distribution, medical-surgical supply distribution,
pharmaceutical dispensing automation, pharmacy outsourcing, clinical software
and utilization reviews. In addition, our ability to provide
patient-assistance programs and the distribution of specialty products has also
contributed to our increase in revenues. These retail chain and institutional
capabilities have resulted in the execution and implementation of significant
long-term, multi-business unit contracts with major customers.

Increases in U.S. Healthcare pharmaceutical distribution revenues,
excluding sales to customers’ warehouses, reflect market growth rates as well
as new customers in our pharmaceutical distribution business, new business that
was previously direct or outside the distribution channel and growth in our
automation, specialty pharmaceutical products, and pharmacy outsourcing
services businesses. Market growth rates reflect growing drug utilization and
price increases, which are offset in part by the increased use of lower priced
generics.

U.S. pharmaceutical distribution sales to customers’ warehouses increased
12% in 2003 and 23% in 2002, as a result of growth from existing customers as
well as, in 2002, the addition of a few significant retail chain customers.
Sales to customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals
to major self-warehousing drugstore chains whereby we act as an intermediary in
the order and subsequent delivery of products directly from the manufacturer to
the customers’ warehouses. These sales provide a benefit to our customers in
that they can use one source for both their direct store-to-store business and
their warehouse business. We also provide a significant benefit to
manufacturers, since all incoming products for direct store-to-store deliveries
are shipped to a single McKesson location.

Canadian pharmaceutical distribution revenues increased 19% in 2003 and 9%
in 2002, reflecting market growth rates and greater sales to existing
customers. Revenues for 2003 also benefited from increased sales of product
that previously went direct from manufacturers, and to a lesser extent,
favorable foreign exchange rates.

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distribution revenues increased
nominally over the past two years. Increases in our primary and extended care
sectors were almost fully offset by a decline in revenues in the acute care
sector. The segment’s decline in its acute care business reflects the
competitive environment in which it operates and the continued self-warehousing
strategy of a major customer.

Increases in revenues for our Information Solutions segment were primarily
due to our July 2001 introduction of new products from our Horizon
Clinicals

TM

offerings as well as other new product offerings in 2003, including Horizon
Medical Imaging

TM

, which was the result of our July 2002 purchase of A.L.I.
Technologies Inc. (“A.L.I.”).

As of March 31, 2003, backlog for our Information Solutions segment, which
includes firm contracts for maintenance fees, implementation and software
contracts, and outsourcing agreements, increased to $2.22 billion from $2.06
billion a year ago and from $1.60 billion two years ago. The increase in
backlog from 2001 to 2002 resulted primarily from a new ten-year, $480 million
outsourcing contract to provide a standardized, fully automated human resources
and payroll system for the National Health Service of England and Wales,
covering approximately one million employees.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Gross profit increased by 11% in 2003 and 15% in 2002. As a percentage of
revenues, excluding sales to customers’ warehouses, gross profit margin
decreased 24 basis points in 2003 and 15 basis points in 2002, primarily
reflecting:

—

a higher proportion of revenues attributable to our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment, which has lower margins relative to our other
segments,

—

a decline in the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment gross margin
reflecting a decrease in selling margin to customers in the U.S.
Pharmaceutical distribution business, that were partially offset by
greater product sourcing profits on branded pharmaceuticals and the
benefit of increased sales of generic drugs with higher margins. In
addition, the segment benefited from the growth in higher margin
products and services, and

—

in 2003, a $51.0 million provision for expected losses on five
multi-year contracts in our Information Solutions segment
international business. Partially offsetting the decreases were
greater software revenues with higher margins from this segment in
2003 and 2002.

We provide financial ratios (gross margins, operating expenses, and
segment operating profit margins as a percentage of revenues) which exclude
sales to customers’ warehouses as these revenues from bulk shipments to
warehouses have a significantly lower gross margin compared to traditional
direct store delivery sales because of their low cost-to-serve model. These
sales do, however, contribute positively to our cash flows due to favorable
timing between the customer payment to us and our payment to the supplier.

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment uses the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”)
method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost
of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than do other accounting
methods, thereby mitigating the effects of inflation and deflation on operating
profit. The practice in the Pharmaceutical Solutions distribution businesses
is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers.
Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which prevents
inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in
this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in
other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in
those fiscal years.

Excluding the items noted below, operating expenses increased over the last two
years primarily reflecting additional expenses incurred to support our sales
volume growth.

—

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we incurred restructuring and related asset
impairment charges of a credit of $4.8 million, and expenses of $39.8
million and $171.7 million. We also recorded reserves for customer
settlements of $161.1 million in 2001 and reversed $22.3 million of
the reserve to income in 2003. Further discussions regarding these
activities are included in “Restructuring and Related Asset
Impairments” appearing within this Financial Review.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

—

In 2002, we sold three businesses for a pre-tax loss of $22.0 million.

—

In accordance with our adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002, we
discontinued amortizing goodwill. Operating expenses in 2001 included
goodwill amortization of $49.4 million.

Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding sales to
customers’ warehouses and the above noted items, have declined over the last
two years, mainly due to productivity improvements in back-office and field
operations.

Operating
expenses in 2003 include U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense of
$1.9 million compared with pension income of $9.9 million in 2002 and $6.1
million in 2001. The pension expense in 2003 is principally the result of
negative plan asset returns over the past two years. In 2003, we reduced the
assumed long-term rate of asset return for our U.S. defined benefit pension
plans by 150 basis points to 8.25% to better reflect current long-term
expectations for the plans’ portfolios. We also lowered our assumption for the
discount rate by 50 basis points to 6.75% on these plans to better reflect
current rates for high-quality corporate long term bonds. As a result of these
changes, we anticipate pension expense to increase by approximately $12 million
in 2004.

The decline in asset performance coupled with the lower interest rates
resulted in the recognition of a $7.2 million pre-tax charge to equity in 2003.
This charge increased the accrued pension plan liability and accumulated other
comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity by $5.1 million after-tax. This
charge will vary based on changes in interest rates or market performance and
plan returns. We expect contributions for our U.S. defined benefit pension
plans in 2004 to approximate that of 2003.

We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of the
pension plan’s December 31st measurement date. Although future changes to the
discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 100
basis points, the U.S. defined benefit pension liability would have decreased
$28.7 million or increased $36.9 million. Similarly, a 100 basis point
increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or
increase defined benefit pension expense for the U.S. plans by approximately
$3.4 million.

Other Income and Gain (Loss) on Investments, net:

Other income increased in 2003 and decreased nominally in 2002. The
increase in 2003 was primarily attributable to a $5.3 million gain on the sale
of notes receivable within our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.

Gain (loss) on investments changed significantly in 2003 and 2002, primarily reflecting:

—

in 2003, our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment recognized $9.9 million in gains on sales of venture investments,

—

a decrease in Corporate investment losses associated with other-than-temporary impairment losses on equity and joint
venture investments, and

—

in 2001, we recorded other-than-temporary losses of $93.1 million on our WebMD warrants and $12.5 million on other equity
and venture capital investments as a result of significant declines in the market values of these investments, partially
offset by a $7.8 million gain on the liquidation of another investment. We also recorded an other-than-temporary
impairment loss of $23.1 million on equity investments as a result of significant declines in the market value of these
investments in connection with the restructuring of our former
iMcKesson segment.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Expenses:

Segment operating profit includes gross margin, net of operating expenses,
other income and gain (loss) on investments for our three business segments.
In addition to the items noted below, increases in segment operating profit
primarily reflect revenue growth and increased operating margin in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, combined with improved operating profits in
our Information Solutions segment. The 2002 increase was partially offset by a
decline in operating profit in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.

Excluding sales to customers’ warehouses, operating profit as a percentage
of revenues increased over the past two years for our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment reflecting productivity improvements in operations offset in part by a
decline in gross margins. In addition, operating profit in 2003 benefited from
a $5.3 million gain on sale of notes receivables and $9.9 million of gains on
sales of venture investments in 2003, lower restructuring charges, and the
discontinuance of goodwill amortization commencing in 2002. Operating profit
for 2001 included $8.0 million in goodwill amortization.

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment’s operating profit as a percentage of
revenues stabilized in 2003 after decreasing in 2002. The decrease in 2002
operating profit reflects the competitive environment in which the segment
operates, the commencement of a self-warehousing strategy by a major customer,
and the start of the segment’s distribution center network consolidation plan
which resulted in $29.6 million of restructuring and related asset impairment
charges. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of excluding
goodwill amortization which amounted to $19.0 million in 2001. Results for
2002 and 2003 also include duplicate operating expenses associated with the
segment’s restructuring activities and replacement of information systems.
Additional operating expenses incurred include duplicate payroll,
transportation and warehouse costs as the segment consolidated distribution
centers. In addition, 2003 operating profit benefited from $12.0 million in
reversals of prior year’s accrued restructuring charges as a result of a
modification to the segment’s distribution center network consolidation plan,
partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of approximately $11.0
million.

This segment’s distribution center network consolidation program was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and we expect to complete the
information systems consolidation plan in 2005. As a result of these
consolidation plans, we anticipate realizing benefits of more efficient
operations in this business beginning in late 2004.

Information Solutions segment’s operating profit as a percentage of
revenues increased over the past two years reflecting increases in higher
margin software revenue, more efficient operations resulting from improved
customer support activities and control of expenses, a decrease in
restructuring and related asset impairment charges, and the benefit of
eliminating goodwill amortization commencing in 2002. Operating profit for
2001 included $22.4 million in goodwill amortization. Operating profit also
reflects the following items: a $51.0 million provision for expected losses on
five multi-year contracts within the segment’s international business and a
$22.3 million credit for the



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

reversal of a portion of customer settlement reserves in 2003, $19.3
million of losses on sales of businesses in 2002, and $161.1 million loss for
customer settlements in 2001.

Corporate expenses increased by 5% in 2003 and decreased by 33% in 2002.
The increase in expenses for 2003 was principally due to higher benefit and
insurance costs and lower pension income, partially offset by lower venture
investment impairment losses, lower expenses associated with the use of our
accounts receivable sales facility and a decrease in expenses associated with
our investment in The Global Health Exchange (“GHE”), formerly Health Nexis,
LLC (“Health Nexis”). In the second quarter of 2003, we lowered our pension
plan assets earnings assumption to 8.25% from 9.75%. The 2002 decrease in
expenses reflect lower restructuring charges and venture investment impairment
losses, partially offset by higher benefit costs and expenses associated with
the use of our accounts receivable sales facility, increased losses in our
investment in GHE and a litigation settlement. In the third quarter of 2002,
Health Nexis merged with GHE, which significantly diluted our percentage
ownership in the combined organization. As a result, we changed from the
equity to the cost method of accounting for this investment.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense increased nominally in 2003 and 2002
primarily due to higher average borrowings. Interest expense reflects the
issuance of $400.0 million 7.75% notes in January 2002 partially offset by the
retirement of $175.0 million 6.875% notes in March 2002, and $125.0 million
6.55% notes in November 2002. In addition, we also used our accounts
receivable sales facility more in 2002 compared to 2003 and 2001 in order to
meet our financing needs. The costs associated with this facility are recorded
in Corporate expenses.

In order to better balance fixed and variable rate borrowings, we entered
into two interest rate swap agreements in 2003. The first agreement exchanges
a fixed interest rate of 8.91% per annum to the London Inter Bank Offering Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus 4.155%, on a notional amount of $100 million and matures in
February 2005. The second agreement exchanges a fixed interest rate of 6.30%
per annum to LIBOR plus 1.575%, on a notional amount of $150 million and
matures in March 2005. These agreements are designated as fair value hedges
and are intended to manage our ratio of variable to fixed interest rates.

Income Taxes:

Excluding the items discussed below, the Company’s
effective income tax rate was 34.0%, 36.0% and 39.0% in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
The reduction in our effective income tax rate was the result of a higher
proportion of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income
tax rates and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization commencing in 2002,
which was generally non tax-deductible.

In 2002, we sold three businesses for a pre-tax loss of $22.0 million and
an after-tax gain of $22.0 million. For accounting purposes, the net assets of
one of these businesses were written down in 2001 in connection with the
restructuring of our former iMcKesson segment. The tax benefit could not be
recognized until 2002 when the sale of the business was completed.

Discontinued Operations:

Net loss from discontinued operations was $6.7
million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2003, $3.2 million ($0.01 per diluted
share) in 2002, and $5.0 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2001. Results
from discontinued operations include those of a marketing fulfillment business
which we sold in 2003 as well as adjustments made in 2003 and 2001 relating to
the 2000 divestiture of our Water Products business.

Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding:

Diluted earnings per share
were calculated based on an average number of shares outstanding of 298.8
million, 298.1 million and 283.1 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001. The increase
in weighted average number of shares outstanding in 2002 was due to the
inclusion of 5.4 million share equivalents relating to our convertible
preferred securities and 7.5 million of dilutive securities issued under
employee benefit plans, which were excluded in 2001 as they were anti-dilutive.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

International Operations

International operations accounted for 6.3%, 6.0% and 6.6% of 2003, 2002
and 2001 of consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to
certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor
our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and
political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional
information regarding our international operations is also included in
Financial Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.

Restructuring and Related Asset Impairments

With the exception of our customer settlement process, we have completed
the restructuring programs described below. Net charges (credits) from
restructuring activities over the last three years were as follows:

In 2003, we recorded net credits for restructuring activities of $4.8
million primarily related to the following:

—

Net reversals of $5.5 million and $6.5 million for severance and exit-related accruals pertaining to our 2002
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distribution center network consolidation plan. The reversals were the result of our
re-evaluation of this segment’s distribution center strategy. The original consolidation plan included a net reduction of
20 distribution centers, from 51, compared to a net reduction of 14 under the revised plan. This revised consolidation
plan resulted in the termination of 261 employees, primarily in distribution delivery and associated back-office functions.

—

We recorded restructuring charges of $2.9 million for severance, exit-related costs and asset impairments pertaining to the
closure of a Pharmaceutical Solutions’ distribution center. The closure resulted in the termination of 65 employees.

—

We recorded $5.1 million in charges for additional facility closure costs, reflecting a change in estimated costs
associated with prior year restructuring plans in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2002, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $39.8 million as follows:

—

We recorded severance charges of $19.8 million, exit-related charges of $19.5 million and asset impairment charges of $7.6
million primarily related to a plan to reduce the number of
distribution centers in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment from 51 to
31, restructuring activities in our European and U.S. businesses in our Information Solutions segment, and closures of a
distribution center and a facility for a service business in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Excluding the
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment restructuring initiatives, which were later revised in 2003, 295 employees, primarily in
distribution, delivery and associated back-office functions, were terminated as a result of these activities.

—

We also reassessed restructuring plans initiated prior to 2002, and reversed a total of $7.1 million in severance and
exit-related reserves due to a change in estimated costs to complete these activities.

In 2001, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $194.8
million. These charges were for several initiatives, the most significant of
which were:

—

We restructured our former iMcKesson segment. Responsibility for
iMcKesson’s medical management business was transferred to our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and the physician services business to
our Information Solutions segment. The iMcKesson segment was created in
the first quarter of 2001 with the intention of focusing on healthcare
applications using the Internet and other emerging technologies, and
included selected net assets from our former e-Health, Pharmaceutical
Solutions and Information Solutions segments as well as other 2001
acquisitions and investments. In connection with the assessment of these
businesses, we shut down certain iMcKesson operations. We wrote down
goodwill and intangibles totaling $116.2 million arising from the
acquisitions of Abaton.com and MediVation, Inc., based upon an updated
analysis of discounted cash flows. We also recorded $29.8 million in
asset impairments, including $23.1 million for the write–down of equity
investments whose market values had significantly declined and $5.2
million in capitalized software costs. In addition, we recorded $9.1
million in exit-related costs, including $6.0 million for non-cancelable
obligations directly related to discontinued products.

In connection with the above restructuring, we incurred $29.0 million in
severance charges relating to the termination of 220 employees, primarily in
sales, service and administration functions.

—

We recorded $10.0 million in restructuring and asset related impairment
charges ($5.6 million in severance, $2.3 million in exit costs and $2.1
million in asset impairments) related to workforce reductions in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment associated with the closure of a
pharmaceutical distribution center, closure of a medical management call
center, closures of facilities in the pharmaceutical services business and
staff reductions in the pharmacy management business. In connection with
these restructurings, 240 employees were terminated who were primarily in
sales, service, administration and distribution center functions.

In addition to the above restructuring activities, we are still managing a
2001/2000 restructuring plan associated with customer settlements for our
discontinuance of overlapping or nonstrategic products and other product
development projects within our Information Solutions segment. Details
regarding this restructuring plan are as follows:

Subsequent to the January 1999 merger with HBO and Company (“HBOC”) and the
events surrounding our announcements in April, May and June of 1999
concerning the improper recording of revenue at HBOC, we restructured our
Information Solutions segment, which included the required assembly of a new
senior management team and a restructuring of the segment’s sales and
customer service organizations, which had experienced significant attrition.
The restructuring plan also included a strategic rationalizing of the
segment’s product lines, which was carried out in three phases: Phase
I-assessment and preliminary planning (October 1999 to January 2000); Phase
II-detailed planning and announcement; and Phase III-implementation. The
products impacted by this initiative were primarily in the areas of
repositories for clinical and administrative data in a healthcare
enterprise, surgery scheduling, financial and materials management, mobile
clinical documentation and enterprise solutions for small and mid-sized
hospitals. The process required a review of contracts related to
approximately 400 affected customers and other information available at that
time.

During Phase II, which began in February 2000 and extended through March 31,
2000, we conducted detailed business reviews, and finalized and announced
product rationalization decisions. Rationalization decisions



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

involved either the sunset of certain products or product development
projects to redesign or stabilize several go-forward products. At the same
time, we undertook an assessment of probable customer impact and concluded
that the product rationalization decisions would trigger the assertion of
certain customer claims for breach of contract. Based on information
available at that time, we estimated that it would require $74.1 million
above then existing allowances to settle probable customer claims. As a
result, a charge in that amount was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Phase III, which began in 2001, involved a comprehensive, company-wide
implementation of Phase II decisions, including an intensive and detailed
customer communication process. By the fourth quarter of 2001, we had
developed substantially more information on customers’ legal positions as a
result of extensive customer interactions and communications. Based upon
this newly acquired information about customer demands and expectations, we
recognized that we would not be able to settle probable contractual
exposures within the previously recorded estimates, and we therefore
concluded that additional allowances should be established for customers’
settlements. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2001, an additional
customer settlement charge of $161.1 million was recorded. These customer
settlement charges were reflected as operating expenses rather than a
reduction of revenues as the charges primarily related to product strategy
decisions that triggered claims for breach of contract.

In 2003, we reversed $22.3 million of these customer settlement reserves.
The reversal was the result of favorable settlements and continued
negotiations with affected customers. As of March 31, 2003, customer
settlement allowances amounted to $86.9 million. Total cash and non-cash
settlements of $43.2 million and $82.8 million have been incurred since the
inception of the restructuring plan. Although the final outcome of
remaining customer settlements cannot be determined, we believe that any
additional liability and related expenditures would not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring and Related Asset Impairments,”
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion
regarding our restructuring activities.

Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures

We made the following acquisitions, investments and divestitures over the last three years:

—

In September 2002, we sold the net assets of a marketing fulfillment
business which was previously included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment. Net proceeds from the sale of this business were $4.5
million. The disposition resulted in an after-tax loss of $3.7
million or $0.01 per diluted share. The net assets and results of
operations of this business have been presented as a discontinued
operation and, as a result, prior year amounts have been reclassified.

—

In July and September of 2002, we acquired the outstanding stock of
A.L.I. by means of a cash tender offer. A.L.I., which is based in
British Columbia, Canada, provides digital medical imaging solutions
which are designed to streamline access to diagnostic information,
automate clinical workflow and eliminate the need for film purchase
and storage. The acquisition of A.L.I. complements our Horizon
Clinicals

TM

offering by incorporating medical images into a
computerized patient record. The aggregate purchase price for A.L.I.
was $347.0 million and was financed through cash and short-term
borrowings. The results of A.L.I.’s operations have been included in
the consolidated financial statements within our Information Solutions
segment since the July acquisition date.

—

In May 2002, the Company and Quintiles Transnational Corporation
formed a joint venture, Verispan, L.L.C. (“Verispan”). Verispan is a
provider of patient-level data delivered in near real time as well as
a supplier of other healthcare information. We have an approximate
45% equity interest in the joint venture. The initial contribution to
the joint venture of $12.1 million consisted of $7.7 million in net
assets from a Pharmaceutical Solutions’ business and $4.4 million in
cash. Additional cash contributions of $1.9 million have been made
subsequent to formation. As of March 31, 2003, we have committed to
provide additional aggregate cash contributions of up to $8.5 million
and to purchase a total of $12.0 million in services from the joint
venture through 2007. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of
this transaction. Financial results for this joint

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Pro forma results of operations for these business acquisitions have not
been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated
financial statements on either an individual or aggregate basis. Refer to
Financial Notes 2 and 3, “Acquisitions and Investments” and “Discontinued
Operations and Other Divestitures,” to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further discussions regarding these activities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires
us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the
accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably
could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate
that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a
material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below
are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our
operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are
described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of our
consolidated financial statements. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such
estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Valuation of Receivables:

We provide short-term credit and other customer
financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services.
Other customer financing relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or
their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories, and lease and credit
financing. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full
collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge
regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance is
recorded in our consolidated financial statement for these amounts

.

If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’
financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for
uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing
and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. At March
31, 2003, trade and notes receivable was $4,581.8 million, and other customer
financing was $216.9 million, both prior to allowances of $265.8 million.

In addition, at March 31, 2003,
we had $84.4 million of notes receivable from certain of our
current and former officers and senior managers related to purchases
of common stock under our various employee stock purchase plans. These
notes were issued for amounts equal to the market value of the stock
on the date of the purchase, are full recourse to the borrower and
are due at various dates through February 2004. As of March 31,
2003, the value of the underlying stock collateral was
$36.5 million. We evaluate the collectability of these notes on
an ongoing basis; however, notwithstanding their full recourse
nature, there can be no assurance that we will recover the full
amounts due under the notes.

Customer Settlement Reserves:

In 2001 and 2000, we announced plans to
discontinue overlapping and nonstrategic products or product development
projects and to redesign or stabilize several go-forward projects within our
Information Solutions segment. As a result of our decision, we recorded a
total of $235.2 million for estimated customer settlements. These estimates
were developed using a customer and product specific approach, based on
numerous interactions with our customers.

The determination and quantification of our customer settlement
liabilities along with the assessment of an appropriate reserve for
uncollectible accounts is an on-going process, and we are still actively
engaged in settlement discussions with affected customers. Factors that could
change our estimated settlement amounts include, but are not limited to, our
success in amending contract terms to provide new or different products and
services or negotiating settlements with affected customers, and our ability to
complete projects where re-design or stabilization was required. In 2003, due
to favorable settlements and continued negotiations with affected customers, we
reversed $22.3 million of the accrued customer settlement reserve as a credit
to operating expenses. As of March 31, 2003, customer settlement allowances
amounted to $86.9 million. Total cash and non-cash settlements of $43.2
million and $82.8 million have been incurred since the inception of the
restructuring plan. Although the final outcome of remaining customer
settlement issues cannot be determined, we believe that any additional
liability and related expenditures would not have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Valuation of Inventories:

We state inventories at the lower of cost or
market. Inventories for our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical
Solutions segments consist of merchandise held for resale with the majority of
the cost of domestic inventories determined on the last-in, first-out method and
international inventories are stated at average cost. Information Solutions
segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined either by
the specific identification or first-in, first-out method. Total
inventories before the LIFO cost adjustment, which approximates replacement
cost, were $6,241.0 million at March 31, 2003. In determining whether
inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including
estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities,
outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends
and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of
generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products, or the loss of one or more
significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our
inventories.

Valuation of Goodwill:

We have significant goodwill assets as a result of
acquiring businesses. We account for goodwill under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires us to maintain goodwill assets on
our books unless the assets are deemed to be impaired. We perform an
impairment test on goodwill balances annually or when indicators of impairment
exist. Such impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value
of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the operations in
which goodwill is assigned. If carrying value exceeds fair value, a second
step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment. Fair values can
be determined using income, market or cost approaches.

We predominately use a discounted cash flow model derived from internal
budgets in assessing fair values for our goodwill impairment testing. Factors
that could change the result of our goodwill impairment test include, but are
not limited to, different assumptions used to forecast future revenues,
expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements used in our
cash flow models. In addition, selection of a risk-adjusted discount rate on
the estimated undiscounted cash flows is susceptible to future changes in
market conditions, and when unfavorable, can adversely affect our original
estimates of fair values. At March 31, 2003, we concluded that there was no
impairment in our goodwill.

Contract Accounting:

We use the percentage of completion method of
accounting to recognize certain revenues and costs, primarily for long-term
software contracts within our Information Solutions segment. This method of
accounting requires us to estimate the timing and amounts of total revenue to
be earned and total costs to be incurred over the life of a contract. Revenue
estimates are derived primarily from negotiated contract prices modified by
assumptions regarding change orders and assumptions regarding penalty
provisions associated with technical performance. Cost estimates are based
primarily on the expected amount of resources and materials required to



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

complete project requirements. Based on the relationship of total
estimated revenues to total estimated costs, a gross margin and cost of sales
percentage is developed. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by
applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue
recognized each period.

The estimated revenue to be earned and costs to complete a project can
change significantly throughout the period of a contract. Factors that could
change estimates include, but are not limited to, the ability to successfully
complete milestones, the timing of milestones, and modifications in the amount
of resources or other costs required to complete the project. Changes in
estimates to complete, and revisions in overall profit estimates on percentage
of completion contracts, are recognized in the period in which they are
determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current estimate of
total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue. Such a provision is
subject to change as additional information is obtained and as contracts
progress toward completion.

Stock
Options:

We account for employee-based stock compensation in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.” Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recorded based
on a stock option’s intrinsic value, which is the difference between the market
value of a company’s stock and the exercise price at the date of grant. As we
generally grant stock options to employees at market value at the date of
grant, compensation expense as a result of option grants has been nominal.

An alternative to APB No. 25 in accounting for stock options is SFAS No.
123, “Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 123 utilizes the fair value method
in valuing stock options and requires expensing of such values. Fair value is
determined based on an option pricing model with the Black-Scholes model being
the most widely available and used model. Such models require the use of
several estimates including expected life of the option, volatility of our
common stock, dividend yields (which includes estimates of future dividends
and market values of our common stock), risk-free interest rates and employee
turnover.

In December 2002, the FASB issued statement No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” which provides
alternatives to implementing SFAS No. 123, with one of the alternatives, being
the prospective method of expensing current year and future options, available
only up to our fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, in April 2003, the FASB
concluded at their public board meeting that all companies will be required to
expense the fair value of employee stock options, although the timing for this
requirement is not yet known.

Had we accounted for employee stock options in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and had we utilized the following transitional
methods per SFAS No. 148, net income and earnings per share for 2003 would have
been:

The
prospective method includes stock-based compensation expense for
those options granted commencing only in the year of adopting SFAS
No. 123, whereas the modified prospective and retrospective
restatement methods includes compensation expense for all awards that
vest in the current year (see also Financial Note 1,
“Significant Accounting Policies,” of our consolidated
financial statements). Awards under our stock option plans generally
vest over four years. Therefore, the cost related to stock-based
compensation under the prospective method in the first few years
of adoption would be less than the modified prospective and
retrospective restatement methods. With respect to the potential adoption of
SFAS No. 123, we would most likely utilize the prospective
transitional method.

Securities Litigation:

We are involved in a number of lawsuits regarding
the restatement of our 1999 historical financial statements. Our directors and
officers’ liability insurance policy covers some of our restatement litigation
costs up to a specified aggregate limit. For costs not covered under our
insurance policy, we accrue for litigation defense and settlement costs when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. We expensed approximately $2 million to $4 million in each of the
last three years in connection with these matters.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of these proceedings, or to estimate the amount of, or potential
range of, loss with respect to these proceedings, and therefore, no accrual for
legal settlement is recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these legal proceedings is
uncertain. The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could
include judgments

against us or settlements that could require substantial
payments by us that could cause us to incur material losses which could have a
material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash flow from operating activities was $695.5 million in 2003,
compared with $326.2 million in 2002 and $325.2 million in 2001. Net cash flow
from operating activities improved in 2003 reflecting greater revenues and
earnings, offset in part with net increases in working capital required to
support our revenue growth. In 2002, working capital reflected the build up
associated with the implementation of new pharmaceutical distribution business
as well as purchasing opportunities. The working capital increase in 2001
reflects the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by the payment of
income taxes on the gain on sale of the Water Products business that was sold
in late 2000.

Net cash used by investing activities was $576.1 million in 2003, compared
with $383.6 million in 2002 and $315.1 million in 2001. Investing activities
for 2003 include $385.8 million for acquisitions of businesses (primarily the
purchase of A.L.I.) and an increase in software expenditures. These
investments were partially offset by $117.9 million of proceeds from the sale
of notes receivable. Expenditures for capitalized software increased in both
2003 and 2002 reflecting our investment in software developed for internal use
and for resale.

Net cash derived by financing activities was a use of cash of $155.2
million in 2003, a source of cash of $181.7 million in 2002, and a use of cash
of $125.5 million in 2001. Fiscal 2003 financing activities include the
repayment of $125.0 million of term debt that had matured. Financing
activities for 2002 reflect our public offering of $400.0 million of 7.75%
unsecured notes, due in 2012. These notes are redeemable at any time, in whole
or in part, at our option. Net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were
used to repay $175.0 million of term debt in March 2002 and for other general
corporate purposes. Financing activities also include our stock repurchase
program that commenced in 2001 which allows us to purchase up to $250 million
of shares of our common stock in open market or private transactions. In 2003,
2002 and 2001, we repurchased approximately 0.9 million, 1.3 million and 2.2
million shares of our common stock for $25.0 million, $44.2 million and $65.6
million.

Working capital primarily includes receivables and inventories, net of
drafts and accounts payable and deferred revenue. Our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment requires a substantial investment in working capital which is
susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory
purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a
function of sales activity, new customer build-up requirements and the desired
level of investment inventory. Consolidated working capital has increased over
the past two years primarily as a result of our higher sales volume.

We reduced our ratio of net debt to net capital employed and increased our
return on equity during the past two years. Improvements reflect a growth in
our operating profit in excess of the growth in working capital and other
investments needed to fund the increase in revenue. Return on equity also
reflects a decrease in impairments on equity and venture investments as well as
restructuring and related asset impairment charges.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Financial
Obligations and Commitments:

The table below presents our significant financial obligations and
commitments at March 31, 2003:

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions
under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of inventory at a discount in the
event these customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial
institutions. Among other limitations, these inventories must be in resalable
condition. We have also guaranteed loans, credit facilities and the payment of
leases for some customers; and we are a secured lender for substantially all of
these guarantees. Customer guarantees range from one to ten years and were
primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain strategic customers. At
March 31, 2003, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and
other customer guarantees were approximately $150.4 million and $66.5 million.
We consider it unlikely that we would make significant payments under these
guarantees, and accordingly, amounts accrued for these guarantees were nominal.

At March 31, 2003, we had commitments to provide $11.7 million of cash
contributions to Verispan and other equity-held investments and other
commitments of $13.2 million, of which no amounts had been
accrued for. In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $46.4 million
of standby letters of credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet
the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and
fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability
programs.

Credit Resources:

We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash, short-term
borrowings and our receivables sale facility. We have a $550.0 million 364-day
revolving credit agreement that expires in September 2003 and a $550.0 million
three-year revolving credit facility that expires in September 2005. These
facilities, which were entered into in September 2002, are primarily intended
to support our commercial paper borrowings, and the terms of which are
substantially similar to those previously in place. We also have a $950.0
million (2002-$850.0 million) revolving receivables sale facility, which
expires in June 2003. We anticipate renewing the receivable sales facility
prior to its expiration. No amounts were utilized under any of these
facilities at March 31, 2003.

Our senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s are currently
BBB, BBB and Baa2, and our commercial paper ratings are currently A-2, F-2, and
P-2. Our ratings are on a negative credit outlook. Our various borrowing
facilities and certain long-term debt instruments are subject to covenants.
Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio, which cannot exceed
56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the
revolving credit facility and $335 million of term debt could be accelerated.
At March 31, 2003, this ratio was 21.6% and we were in compliance with all
other covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings or the lack of compliance
with our covenants could result in a negative impact on our ability to finance
our operations through our credit facilities, as well as the issuance of
additional debt at the interest rates then currently available.

Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements
are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flows from operations,
existing credit sources and other capital market transactions.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

MARKET RISKS

Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas
our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying
weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed
by 50 basis points in 2003, interest expense would not have been materially
different from that reported.

As of March 31, 2003, the aggregate fair values of our long-term debt and
convertible preferred securities were $1,482.6 million and $189.5 million.
Each preferred security is convertible at the rate of 1.3418 shares of our
stock, subject to certain circumstances. Fair values were estimated on the
basis of quoted market prices, although trading in these debt securities is
limited and may not reflect fair value. Fair values are subject to
fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value
of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar
terms.

We derive revenues from Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. We also
have a 22% equity interest in a pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. We are
subject to foreign currency exchange risk on cash flows related to sales,
expenses, financing and investment transactions. If exchange rates on such
currencies were to fluctuate 10%, we believe that our results from operations
and cash flows would not be materially affected. Aggregate foreign exchange
translation gains and losses included in operations, comprehensive income and
stockholders’ equity are discussed in Financial Note 1 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting Policies.”

RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS

Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is
included in “Critical Accounting Policies” appearing within
this Financial Review and Financial Note 20, “Related Party Balances and

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

There are a number of new accounting pronouncements that may impact our
financial results. These new pronouncements are described in Financial Note 1,
“Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, management’s discussion and
analysis includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)
and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”). Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by
use of forward-looking words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
“may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” or
“estimates,” or the negative of these words, or other comparable terminology.
The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans or intentions may also
include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such
risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed under “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” The
reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all
potential risks and uncertainties.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described herein or in our
other public documents. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We
undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to
these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following additional factors may affect our future results:

Adverse resolution of pending litigation regarding the restatement of our
historical financial statements may cause us to incur material losses.

Subsequent to our April 28, 1999 restatement of financial results
announcement, and as of April 29, 2003, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed against us,
certain of our current or former officers or directors, or those of HBOC, and
other defendants. In addition, the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Northern District of California and the San Francisco District Office of the
SEC also have ongoing investigations in connection with the matters relating to the
restatement of previously reported amounts.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of these proceedings, or to estimate the amount of, or potential
range of, loss with respect to these proceedings. In addition, the timing of
the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain. The range of possible
resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against us or
settlements that could require substantial payments by us, which could cause us
to incur material losses.

Changes in the United States healthcare environment could have a material
negative impact on our revenues and net income.

Our products and services are primarily intended to function within the
structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being
used in the United States. In recent years, the healthcare industry has
changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. These changes include
increased use of managed care, cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply
distributors, and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups.

We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in
the future. Some of these changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding
of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations
governing the privacy of patient information, or the delivery or pricing of
pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause
healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products
and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our
products and services.

Changes in pharmaceutical and medical-surgical manufacturers’ pricing,
selling, inventory or distribution policies or practices, or changes
in our customer mix could also
significantly reduce our revenues and net income. Due to the diverse range of
healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and
services that we offer, such changes may adversely impact us, while not
affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and
services.

Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic
drugs will increase over the next few years as a result of the expiration of
certain drug patents. In recent years, our revenues and gross margins have
increased from our generic drug offering programs. An increase or a decrease
in the availability of these generic drugs could have a material impact on our
net income.

Substantial defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of our
products by large customers could have a significant negative impact on our
financial condition and results of operations and liquidity.

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with
a limited number of large customers. During the year ended March 31, 2003,
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of our total
revenues. Sales to our largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented
approximately 12% of our 2003 revenues. At March 31, 2003, accounts receivable
from our ten largest customers and Rite Aid Corporation were approximately 43%
and 10% of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit
concentration have significantly increased. Any defaults in payment or a
material reduction in purchases from this large customer could have a
significant negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations
and liquidity.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments are
dependent upon sophisticated information systems. The implementation delay,
malfunction or failure of these systems for any extended period of time could
adversely affect our business.

We rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain,
rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: facilitate the purchase and
distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution
centers; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis, manage the
accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and process
payments to suppliers. Our business and results of operations may be
materially adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by
unforeseen events, or fail for any extended period of time.

We could become subject to
liability claims that are not adequately covered by our insurance,
and may have to pay damages and other expenses which could have a
material adverse effect on us.

Our
business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution
and dispensing of pharmaceuticals, the provision of ancillary
services (such as our pharmacy management business) and the conduct
of our medical management businesses (which include disease
management programs and our nurse triage services). A successful
product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our
insurance or any applicable contractual indemnity could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

The ability of our Information Solutions business to attract and retain
customers due to challenges in software product integration and technological
advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Our Information Solutions business delivers enterprise-wide patient care,
clinical, financial, managed care, payor and strategic management software
solutions, as well as networking technologies, electronic commerce, outsourcing
and other services to healthcare organizations throughout the United States and
certain foreign countries. Challenges in integrating Information Solutions
software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and
may reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead
to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the
products and services offered by our Information Solutions business. Such
technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services
or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure. The success of our
Information Solutions business will depend, in part, on its ability to be
responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing
business models. To remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information
systems marketplace, our Information Solutions business must develop new
products on a timely basis. The failure to develop competitive products and to
introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our
Information Solutions business to attract and retain customers and thereby
significantly reduce our net income.

Our Information Solutions segment utilizes licenses from third parties.

We license the rights to use certain technologies from third-party vendors
to incorporate in or complement our Information Solutions segment products and
solutions. These licenses are generally nonexclusive, must be renewed
periodically by mutual consent, and may be terminated if we breach the terms of
the license. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product
shipments until we obtain equivalent technology, which could hurt our business.
Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by
these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us. In
addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed
technology in the future, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own
products.

Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and proprietary rights
may infringe on the rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark
laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to
protect our proprietary rights to our products. There can be no assurance that
these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not
independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technology. Although we believe that our products and other
proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third
parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims
against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement claims against us in the future. If we were found to be
infringing on other’s rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage
awards and forced to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or
cease selling the products that contain the infringing property. Additionally,
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets,
to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights, and to determine the
scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These types of
litigation can be costly and time consuming. These litigation expenses, damage
payments, or cessation of use of infringing technology and development of
respective replacement technology could be significant and result in material
losses to us.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Potential product liability claims arising from healthcare information
technology business products could result in material losses to us.

We provide products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to
patient medical histories and treatment plans. If these products fail to
provide accurate and timely information, customers could assert liability
claims against us. Litigation with respect to liability claims, regardless of
the outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management’s
attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. We
attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages from negligence,
errors or mistakes. Despite this precaution, the limitations of liability set
forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us
from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage,
including coverage for errors and omissions. However, this coverage may not
continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in
sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us. In addition,
the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.

System errors and warranties in Information Solutions segment’s products could
cause unforeseen liabilities.

Our Information Solutions segment’s systems are very complex. As with
complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially
when first introduced. Our Information Solutions business systems are intended
to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care.
Therefore, users of our products have a greater sensitivity to system errors
than the general market for software products. Failure of a client’s system to
perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of
warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the
system comply with the documentation. If such failure is not remedied in a
timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing
the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid,
or assert claims for significant damages.

Potential regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of
Information Solutions products as medical devices could impose increased costs,
delay the introduction of new products and negatively impact our business.

The FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer
software intended for use in the healthcare industry. The FDA has increasingly
focused on the regulation of computer products and computer-assisted products
as medical devices under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If the FDA
chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose
extensive requirements upon us. If we fail to comply with the applicable
requirements, the FDA could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil
penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production,
refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and
initiating criminal prosecution. Any final FDA policy governing computer
products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing
products or may prevent us from marketing our products.

New and potential federal regulations relating to patient confidentiality could
depress the demand for our Information Solutions products and impose
significant product redesign costs on us.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and
the circumstances under which those records may be released. These regulations
govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record
information and will require the users of such information to implement
specified security measures. Regulations currently in place governing
electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear
and difficult to apply.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA,
requires national standards for some types of electronic health information
transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, security
standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and
standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health
information. In December 2000, final health data privacy regulations were
published that required healthcare organizations to be in compliance by April
2003. Such organizations must also be in compliance with additional
transaction regulations by October 2003 and security regulations by April 2005.

Evolving HIPAA-related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of
our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information. This could
adversely affect demand for our products if they are not re-designed in



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)

a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations that
seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our customers to execute new or
modified healthcare transactions. We may need to expend additional capital,
research and development and other resources to modify our products to address
these evolving data security and privacy issues.

Due to the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our Information
Solutions segment, our future operating results may be impacted.

Our Information Solutions segment has long sales and implementation
cycles, which could range from several months to over two years or more from
initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. How and
when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add
business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. The
solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and
time commitments by the customer. Any decision by our customers to delay
implementation may adversely affect our revenues. Furthermore, delays or
failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a
breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as
well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize
revenue.

Reduced capacity in the commercial property insurance market exposes us to
potential loss.

In order to provide prompt and complete service to our major
Pharmaceutical Solutions customers, we maintain significant product inventory
at certain of our distribution centers. While we seek to maintain property
insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no
assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on
acceptable terms. One or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake
or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could materially
harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate
acquisitions successfully.

An element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate
acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. Integration of
acquisitions involves a number of risks, including the diversion of
management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we
have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and
the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and
retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; challenges in retaining
the customers of the combined businesses; and potential adverse effects on
operating results. In addition, we may potentially require additional
financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be
attainable. If we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic
acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could
be negatively affected.

In addition to the above, the following factors could effect future
results: timing and amounts of ongoing customer settlements within our
Information Solutions segment; changes in generally accepted accounting
principles, including the requirement by accounting setting standards boards to
expense stock options; and general economic conditions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Stockholders and Board of Directors of

McKesson Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2003.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index
at Item 15(a). These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and
subsidiaries at March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Financial Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company is involved in certain shareholder litigation related to HBO & Company
and subsidiaries.

As discussed in Financial Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in
fiscal 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

FINANCIAL NOTES

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations.

The consolidated financial statements of McKesson
Corporation (“McKesson,” the “Company,” or “we” and other similar pronouns)
include the financial statements of all majority-owned companies. Significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March
31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the
Company’s fiscal year.

We conduct our business through three segments: Pharmaceutical Solutions,
Medical-Surgical Solutions and Information Solutions. The Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment includes our U.S. and Canadian pharmaceutical and healthcare
products distribution businesses and a 22% equity interest in a pharmaceutical
distributor in Mexico (Nadro S.A. de C.V., “Nadro”). Our U.S. Pharmaceutical
Solutions business also includes the manufacture and sale of automated
pharmaceutical dispensing systems for hospitals and retail pharmacists, medical
management and specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and
pharmaceutical manufacturers, patient and payor services, consulting and
outsourcing services to pharmacies, and distribution of first-aid products to
industrial and commercial customers. The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment
distributes medical-surgical supplies and equipment, and provides logistics and
related services within the U.S. The Information Solutions segment delivers
enterprise-wide clinical, revenue cycle and resource management software
solutions, as well as technology, outsourcing and other professional services,
to healthcare organizations throughout North America, certain
European countries and the United Kingdom.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

include all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale

are carried at fair value and the
net unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in
marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders’
equity.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories for
the Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments consist of
merchandise held for resale with the majority of the cost of domestic
inventories determined on the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method and
international inventories stated at average cost. Information Solutions
segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined either by
the specific identification or first-in, first-out method. The LIFO method was
used to value approximately 90% of our inventories at March 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001. Total inventories before the LIFO cost adjustment, which approximates
replacement cost, were $6,241.0 million, $6,243.5 million and $5,358.4 million
at March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Property, Plant and Equipment

is stated at cost and depreciated on the
straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of properties
over estimated service lives ranging from one to 50 years.

Capitalized Software Held for Sale

consists of development costs for
software held for sale primarily for our Information Solutions segment. Such
costs are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological
feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of
general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated
useful life of approximately three years. We monitor the net realizable value
of capitalized software held for sale to ensure that the investment will be
recovered through future sales. Additional information regarding our
capitalized software expenditures is as follows:

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Long-lived Assets.

We assess the recoverability of goodwill on an annual
basis and other long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets, including goodwill,
that we expect to hold and use is based on estimated fair values of the assets.
Estimates of fair values are based on quoted market prices, when available,
the results of valuation techniques utilizing discounted cash flows (using the
lowest level of identifiable cash flows) or fundamental analysis. Long-lived
assets to be disposed of, either by sale or abandonment, are reported at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use

is amortized over estimated
useful lives ranging from one to 10 years and is included in other assets in
the consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
capitalized software held for internal use was $327.6 million, $224.3 million
and $139.8 million, net of accumulated amortization of $127.7 million, $99.0
million, and $90.3 million.

Insurance Programs.

Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain
coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required to be
insured by law or contract. It is our policy to retain a significant portion
of certain losses primarily related to workers’ compensation and comprehensive
general, product, and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under
these programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability
for claims incurred. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial assumptions
followed in the insurance industry.

Revenue Recognition

. Revenues for our Pharmaceutical Solutions and
Medical-Surgical Solutions segments are recognized when products are shipped or
services are provided to customers. Included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment revenues are large volume sales of pharmaceuticals to major
self-warehousing drugstore chains whereby we act as an intermediary in the
order and subsequent delivery of products directly from the manufacturer to the
customers’ warehouses. These sales totaled $14.8 billion in 2003, $13.2
billion in 2002, and $10.7 billion in 2001.

Revenues for our Information Solutions segment are generated primarily by
licensing software systems (consisting of software, hardware and maintenance
support), and providing outsourcing and professional services. Software
systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service
agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of
delivery or under the percentage-of-completion contract method in accordance
with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition” and SOP
81-1 “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts,” based on the terms and conditions in the contract.
Changes in estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on
percentage of completion contracts are recognized in the period in which they
are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current estimate
of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue. In 2003, a contract
loss provision of $51.0 million was included in cost of sales, reflecting
expected losses for certain multi-year contracts within this segment’s
international business. This provision is subject to change as additional
information is obtained and as the contracts progress towards completion.
Hardware is generally recognized upon delivery. Multi-year software license
agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software
implementation fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the
percentage-of-completion contract method. Maintenance and support agreements
are marketed under annual or multiyear agreements and are recognized ratably
over the period covered by the agreements. Remote processing services are
recognized monthly as the service is performed. Outsourcing services are
recognized as the service is performed.

We also offer our products on an application service provider (“ASP”)
basis, making available our software functionality on a remote hosting basis
from our data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative
support as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on an ASP
basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract starting
when the hosting services begin.

Income Taxes

. We account for income taxes under the liability method,
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation.

Assets and liabilities of international
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.
Cumulative currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
comprehensive losses in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated
balance sheets. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions
are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations
and were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2003, 2002
or 2001.

Derivative Financial Instruments

. Derivative financial instruments are
used principally in the management of our foreign currency and interest rate
exposures and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value
of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated
as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses and are
recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged item
affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash
flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative
instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each
accounting period with the results included in earnings.

Concentrations of Credit Risk.

Trade receivables subject us to a
concentration of credit risk with customers primarily in our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment. A significant proportion of the increase in revenues has
been to a limited number of large customers and as a result, our credit
concentration has increased. Accordingly, any defaults in payment by or a
reduction in purchases from these large customers could have a significant
negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity. At March 31, 2003, revenues and accounts receivables from our ten
largest customers accounted for approximately 50% and 43% of total revenues and
accounts receivables. Fiscal 2003 revenues to, and March 31, 2003 receivables
from, our largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented approximately 12%
of total revenues and 10% of accounts receivable. We have also provided
financing arrangements to certain of our customers within our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment, some of which are on a revolving basis. At March 31, 2003,
these arrangements totaled $275.9 million and we have a security interest in
the customers’ assets.

Accounts Receivable Sales.

At March 31, 2003, we had a $950 million
committed receivables sales facility which was fully available. The program
qualifies for sale treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 140, “Accounting For Transfers and Servicing Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities.” Sales are recorded at the estimated fair
values of the receivables sold, reflecting discounts for the time value of
money based on U.S. commercial paper rates and estimated loss provisions.
Discounts are recorded in administration expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations.

Employee Stock Options

. We account for our employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Had
compensation cost for our employee stock-based compensation been recognized
based on the fair value method, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Stock-Based Compensation,” net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share
would have been as follows:

New Accounting Pronouncements

. On April 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended in
June 2000 by SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities,” which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. These
statements require that we recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure these instruments at
fair value. The adoption of this accounting standard did not materially impact
our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” which eliminated the pooling method of
accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other
intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We adopted this
accounting standard for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for
the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for
goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. This
accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately disclosed from other
intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and no longer be
amortized but tested for impairment at least annually. We adopted SFAS No. 142
on April 1, 2001 and in accordance with this standard, we discontinued the
amortization of goodwill effective on this date. Had goodwill not been
amortized in 2001, net loss would have been $46.1 million lower than reported,
to $2.2 million, from $48.3 million. Similarly, diluted and basic loss per
share would have been $0.16 lower than reported, to $0.01 from $0.17.

Also in June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting requirements for
retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. In May
2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, 64,
Amendment to FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April
2002.” SFAS No. 145 amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make
various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their
applicability under changed conditions. SFAS Nos. 143 and 145 will become
effective for 2004. These statements are not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” that replaces SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of.” SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale, including those of discontinued operations, be measured at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Discontinued
operations are no longer measured at net realizable value or include amounts
for operating losses that have not yet been incurred. SFAS No. 144 also
broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of
an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity
and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations in a disposal
transaction. We adopted SFAS No. 144 as of April 1, 2002.
As a result of this new standard, in 2003, the Company reclassified a disposition of a
business as a discontinued operation (see Financial Note 3).

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” which replaces Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.” SFAS No. 146
requires that liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities be
recognized when they are incurred. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for
exit costs is recognized at the date of a commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No.
146 also requires that the liability be measured and recorded at fair value.
Accordingly, this standard may affect the timing of recognizing future
restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized. The provisions of SFAS
No. 146 are required to be adopted for restructuring activities initiated after
December 31, 2002 on a prospective basis. Liabilities recognized prior to the
initial application of SFAS No. 146 are continued to be accounted for in
accordance with preexisting guidance. We adopted this standard as of
January 1, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” This interpretation elaborates
on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual
financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45
are effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002,



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

and we have adopted those requirements in the accompanying Financial Note
16. The initial recognition and measurement requirements of FIN No. 45 are
effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. FIN No. 45 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus regarding EITF Issue No.
00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” EITF Issue No. 00-21
addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or
performance of multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The
guidance provided by EITF Issue No. 00-21 is effective for us on contracts
entered into on or after July 1, 2003. We do not believe the adoption of this
standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Also in November 2002, the FASB reached a consensus on EITF Issue No.
02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain
Consideration Received from a Vendor.” EITF Issue No. 02-16 provides that cash
consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the
prices of the vendor’s products or services and should, therefore, be
characterized as a reduction in cost of sales unless it is a payment for assets
or services delivered to the vendor, in which case the cash consideration
should be characterized as revenue, or it is a reimbursement of costs incurred
to sell the vendor’s products, in which case the cash consideration should be
characterized as a reduction of that cost. This consensus is generally
effective for new or modified agreements subsequent to November 2002. We were
previously accounting for rebates in accordance with this consensus, and as a
result, the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” This statement amends
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148
amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. As required, we adopted the disclosure provisions of
this standard. We are currently assessing the fair value approach under SFAS
No. 123 and the transitional provisions of SFAS No. 148.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.” This interpretation clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” in
determining whether a reporting entity should consolidate certain legal
entities, including partnerships, limited liability companies, or trusts, among
others, collectively defined as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). This
interpretation applies to VIEs created or obtained after January 31, 2003, and
as of July 1, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable interest
that it acquired before February 1, 2003. We are currently assessing the
impact of FIN No. 46 on our consolidated financial statements; however, we do
not believe that the adoption of such standard will have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends SFAS
No. 133 for decisions made as part of the FASB’s Derivatives Implementation
Group process, other FASB projects dealing with financial instruments, and in
connection with implementation issues raised in relation to the application of
the definition of a derivative. This statement is generally effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging
relationships designated after June 30, 2003. We are currently assessing the
impact of SFAS No. 149 on our consolidated financial statements.

2. Acquisitions and Investments

We made the following acquisitions and investments over the last three
years:

—

In July and September 2002, we acquired the outstanding stock of A.L.I.
Technologies Inc. (“A.L.I.”) by means of a cash tender offer. A.L.I.,
which is based in British Columbia, Canada, provides digital medical
imaging solutions which are designed to streamline access to diagnostic
information, automate clinical workflow and eliminate the need for film
purchase and storage. The acquisition of A.L.I. complements our Horizon
Clinicals™ offering by incorporating medical images into a computerized
patient record. The results of A.L.I.’s operations have been included in
the consolidated financial statements within our Information Solutions
segment since the July acquisition date.

The aggregate purchase price for A.L.I. was $347.0 million and was financed
through cash and short-term borrowings. The following table summarizes the
estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
date of acquisition:

3. Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures

In September 2002, we sold the net assets of a marketing fulfillment
business which was previously included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.
Net proceeds from the sale of this business were $4.5 million. The
disposition resulted in an after-tax loss of $3.7 million or $0.01 per diluted
share. The net assets and results of operations of this business have been
presented as a discontinued operation and, as a result, prior year amounts have
been reclassified.

In 2000, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Water Products
Company (the “Water Products business”), to Groupe Danone for approximately
$1.1 billion in cash. Fiscal 2003 and 2001 results include adjustments to the
gain on discontinued operations for the Water Products business.

Results of discontinued operations were as follows:

Assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations were $7.3 million
and $3.6 million at March 31, 2002, and $8.0 million and $3.4 million at March
31, 2001.

In 2002, we sold three businesses, Abaton.com, Inc., Amysis Managed Care
Systems, Inc. and ProDental Corporation. Two of these businesses were from our
Information Solutions segment and one was from our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment. Net proceeds from the sale of these businesses were $0.2 million,
resulting in a pre-tax loss of $22.0 million and an after-tax gain of $22.0
million. For accounting purposes, the net assets of one of these businesses
were written down in 2001 in connection with the restructuring of our former
iMcKesson segment. The tax benefit could not be recognized until 2002 when the
sale of the business was completed. In addition, as SFAS No. 144
was not effective until 2003, the dispositions of these businesses
were not treated as discontinued operations.

4. Restructuring and Related Asset Impairments

With the exception of our customer settlement process, we have completed
the restructuring programs described below. Net charges (credits) from
restructuring activities over the last three years were as follows:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In 2003, we recorded net credits for restructuring activities of $4.8
million primarily related to the following:

—

Net reversals of $5.5 million and $6.5 million for severance and exit-related accruals pertaining to our 2002
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distribution center network consolidation plan. The reversals were the result of our
re-evaluation of this segment’s distribution center strategy. The original consolidation plan included a net reduction of
20 distribution centers, from 51, compared to a net reduction of 14 under the revised plan. This revised consolidation
plan resulted in the termination of 261 employees, primarily in distribution delivery and associated back-office functions.

—

We recorded restructuring charges of $2.9 million for severance, exit-related costs and asset impairments pertaining to the
closure of a Pharmaceutical Solutions’ distribution center. The closure resulted in the termination of 65 employees.

—

We recorded $5.1 million in charges for additional facility closure costs, reflecting a change in estimated costs
associated with prior year restructuring plans in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.

In 2002, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $39.8 million as follows:

—

We recorded severance charges of
$19.8 million, exit-related charges of $19.5 million and
asset solutions impairment charges of $7.6
million primarily related to a plan to reduce the number of distribution centers in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment from 51 to
31, restructuring activities in our European and U.S. businesses in our Information segment, and closures of a
distribution center and a facility for a service business in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Excluding the
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment restructuring initiatives, which were later revised in 2003, 295 employees, primarily in
distribution, delivery and associated back-office functions, were terminated as a result of these activities.

—

We also reassessed restructuring plans initiated prior to 2002, and reversed a total of $7.1 million in severance and
exit-related reserves due to a change in estimated costs to complete these activities.

In 2001, we recorded net charges for restructuring activities of $194.8
million. These charges were for several initiatives, the most significant of
which were:

—

We restructured our former iMcKesson segment. Responsibility for
iMcKesson’s medical management business was transferred to our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and the physician services business to
our Information Solutions segment. The iMcKesson segment was created in
the first quarter of 2001 with the intention of focusing on healthcare
applications using the Internet and other emerging technologies, and
included selected net assets from our former e-Health, Pharmaceutical
Solutions and Information Solutions segments as well as other 2001
acquisitions and investments. In connection with the assessment of these
businesses, we shut down certain iMcKesson operations. We wrote down
goodwill and intangibles totaling $116.2 million arising from the
acquisitions of Abaton.com and MediVation, Inc., based upon an updated
analysis of discounted cash flows. We also recorded $29.8 million in
asset impairments, including $23.1 million for the write — down of equity
investments whose market values had significantly declined and $5.2
million in capitalized software costs. In addition, we recorded $9.1
million in exit-related costs, including $6.0 million for non-cancelable
obligations directly related to discontinued products.

In connection with the above restructuring, we incurred $29.0 million in
severance charges relating to the termination of 220 employees, primarily in
sales, service and administration functions.

—

We recorded $10.0 million in restructuring and asset related impairment
charges ($5.6 million in severance, $2.3 million in exit costs and $2.1
million in asset impairments) related to workforce reductions in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment associated with the closure of a
pharmaceutical distribution center, closure of a medical management call
center, closures of facilities in the pharmaceutical services business and
staff reductions in the pharmacy management business. In connection with
these restructurings, 240 employees were terminated who were primarily in
sales, service, administration and distribution center functions.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The following table summarizes the activity related to the restructuring
liabilities for the three years ending March 31, 2003:

Accrued restructuring liabilities are included in other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balances at March 31, 2003 for the
Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments relate
primarily to on-going lease obligations. Corporate accrued severance primarily
pertains to retirement costs which are expected to be paid in 2004 and 2005.
Restructuring liabilities for the Information Solutions segment primarily
represent accrued severance and contract liabilities anticipated to be paid in
2004.

In addition to the above restructuring activities, we are still managing a
2001/2000 restructuring plan associated with customer settlements for our
discontinuance of overlapping or nonstrategic products and other product
development projects within our Information Solutions segment. Details
regarding this restructuring plan are as follows:

Subsequent to the January 1999 merger with HBO and Company (“HBOC”) and the
events surrounding our announcements in April, May and June of 1999
concerning the improper recording of revenue at HBOC, we restructured our
Information Solutions segment, which included the required assembly of a new
senior management team and a restructuring of the segment’s sales and
customer service organizations, which had experienced significant attrition.
The restructuring plan also included a strategic rationalizing of the
segment’s product lines, which was carried out in three phases: Phase
I-assessment and preliminary planning (October 1999 to January 2000); Phase
II-detailed planning and announcement; and Phase III-implementation. The
products impacted by this initiative were primarily in the areas of
repositories for clinical and administrative data in a healthcare
enterprise, surgery scheduling, financial and materials management, mobile
clinical documentation and enterprise solutions for small and mid-sized
hospitals. The process required a review of contracts related to
approximately 400 affected customers and other information available at that
time.

During Phase II, which began in February 2000 and extended through March 31,
2000, we conducted detailed business reviews, and finalized and announced
product rationalization decisions. Rationalization decisions involved
either the sunset of certain products or product development projects to
redesign or stabilize several go-forward products. At the same time, we
undertook an assessment of probable customer impact and concluded that the
product rationalization decisions would trigger the assertion of certain
customer claims for



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

breach of contract. Based on information available at that time, we
estimated that it would require $74.1 million above then existing allowances
to settle probable customer claims. As a result, a charge in that amount
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Phase III, which began in 2001, involved a comprehensive, company-wide
implementation of Phase II decisions, including an intensive and detailed
customer communication process. By the fourth quarter of 2001, we had
developed substantially more information on customers’ legal positions as a
result of extensive customer interactions and communications. Based upon
this newly acquired information about customer demands and expectations, we
recognized that we would not be able to settle probable contractual
exposures within the previously recorded estimates, and we therefore
concluded that additional allowances should be established for customers’
settlements. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2001, an additional
customer settlement charge of $161.1 million was recorded. These customer
settlement charges were reflected as operating expenses rather than a
reduction of revenues as the charges primarily related to product strategy
decisions that triggered claims for breach of contract.

In 2003, we reversed $22.3 million of these customer settlement reserves.
The reversal was the result of favorable settlements and continued
negotiations with affected customers. As of March 31, 2003, customer
settlement allowances amounted to $86.9 million and are included in accounts
receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Total cash and non-cash
settlements of $43.2 million and $82.8 million have been incurred since the
inception of the restructuring plan. Although the final outcome of
remaining customer settlements cannot be determined, we believe that any
additional liability and related expenditures would not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

5. Gain (Loss) on Investments, Net

Gain (loss) on investments includes gains and losses from the sale or
liquidation of investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses. We
recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of $8.5 million, $14.6 million,
and $128.7 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001 on equity and joint venture
investments as a result of significant declines in the market values of these
investments. We used quoted market prices, if available, to determine the fair
value of our investments. For investments that do not trade regularly, we
estimated fair value using a variety of pricing techniques including discounted
cash flow analyses and market transactions. In 2001, the other-than-temporary
investment losses included $93.1 million on our WebMD Inc. warrants, $23.1
million on equity investments in connection with the restructuring of our
former iMcKesson segment, and $12.5 million on other equity and venture capital
investments.

gain on sale of $5.3 million was recognized from this sale.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

7. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to
basic earnings (loss) per share except that it reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

The computations for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share from
continuing operations are as follows:

Approximately 33.3 million and 27.4 million stock options were excluded
from the computations of diluted net earnings per share in 2003 and 2002 as
their exercise price was higher than the Company’s average stock price. For
2001, the calculation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
excluded stock options, convertible preferred securities and restricted stock
as they were antidilutive.

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

We have a 364-day revolving credit agreement that allows for short-term
borrowings of up to $550.0 million which expires in September 2003, and a
$550.0 million three-year revolving credit facility which expires in September
2005. These facilities, which were entered into in September 2002, are
primarily intended to support our commercial paper borrowings and the terms of
which are substantially similar to those previously in place. We also have a
$950.0 million (2002 — $850.0 million) revolving receivables sale facility,
which expires in June 2003. We anticipate renewing the receivable sales
facility prior to its expiration. At March 31, 2003, there were no amounts
utilized under any of these facilities.

On January 24, 2002, we completed a public offering of $400.0 million of
7.75% unsecured notes, due in 2012. These notes are redeemable at any time, in
whole or in part, at our option. Net proceeds of $397.3 million for the
issuance of these notes was used to repay term debt and for other general
corporate purposes.

Employee stock ownership program (“ESOP”) related debt bears interest at
rates ranging from 8.6% fixed rate to approximately 89% of LIBOR or LIBOR plus
0.4% and is due in semi-annual and annual installments through 2009.

Our various borrowing facilities and certain long-term debt instruments
are subject to covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital
ratio, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt
outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $335.0 million of term debt
could be accelerated. At March 31, 2003, this ratio was 21.6% and we were in
compliance with all other covenants.

Aggregate annual payments on long-term debt, including capital lease
obligations, for the years ending March 31, are as follows: $10.2 million in
2004, $278.6 million in 2005, $8.8 million in 2006, $28.9 million in 2007,
$159.3 million in 2008 and $815.1 million thereafter.

12. Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

At March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, drafts and accounts payable,
and other liabilities approximate their estimated fair values because of the
short maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of our long-term debt and convertible preferred
securities were as follows:

may not be representative of actual values of the financial instruments that
could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.

In 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements which have been
designated as fair value hedges. The first agreement exchanges a fixed
interest rate of 8.91% per annum to LIBOR plus 4.155%, on a notional amount of
$100 million. The second agreement exchanges a fixed interest rate of 6.30%
per annum to LIBOR plus 1.575%, on a notional amount of $150 million. These
agreements expire in February and March of 2005. In 2002, we entered into a
series of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge certain
liabilities of our United Kingdom subsidiary. At March 31, 2003, these
contracts will convert £25.5 million into U.S. $36.5 million and have various
maturities through March 2006 which are based on the expected repayment dates
of the liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate swaps and foreign
currency exchange contracts were $11.5 million and $37.9 million at March 31,
2003 and nil and $17.1 million at March 31, 2002, most of which were recorded
in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

13. Lease Obligations

We lease facilities and equipment under both capital and operating leases.
Net assets held under capital leases included in property, plant and equipment
were $5.5 million, $11.2 million and $13.7 million at March 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001.

Future minimum lease payments and sublease rental income for years ending
March 31 are:

Rental expense was $109.6 million, $110.1 million and $108.7 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001. Most real property leases contain renewal options and
provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and operating expenses in excess
of base period amounts.

14. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

We maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension
plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees. In addition, we
provide postretirement benefits, consisting of healthcare and life insurance
benefits, for certain eligible employees. We also participate in bargaining
unit sponsored multi-employer plans for employees with union affiliations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Eligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company prior to 1997 are
covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan. In 1997,
we amended this plan to freeze all plan benefits based on each employee’s plan
compensation and creditable service accrued to that date. The benefits for
this defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at
date of retirement, years of service and employees’ pay during the five years
prior to retirement. We also have nonqualified supplemental defined benefit
plans for certain U.S. executives, which are non-funded.

million, $73.1 million and $69.8 million at March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

The projected unit credit method is utilized for measuring net periodic
pension cost over the employees’ service life for the U.S. plans and actuarial
losses are recognized over 7-8 year periods. Costs are funded based on the
recommendations of independent actuaries. Assumptions used to estimate the
actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations were as follows:

Under various U.S. bargaining unit labor contracts, we make payments into
multi-employer pension plans established for union employees. We are liable
for a proportionate part of the plans’ unfunded vested benefits liabilities
upon our withdrawal from the plan, however information regarding the relative
position of each employer with respect to the actuarial present value of
accumulated benefits and net assets available for benefits is not available.
Contributions to the plans and amounts accrued were not material as of and for
years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible Canadian and
United Kingdom employees. At March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 the fair value of
assets for these plans amounted to $30.8 million, $32.3 million and $33.9
million and accumulated benefit obligations amounted to $45.4 million, $35.1
million and $31.5 million. For the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
pension expense for these plans were $3.1 million, $1.6 million and $1.1
million.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have contributory profit sharing investment plans (“PSIP”) for U.S.
employees not covered by collective bargaining arrangements. Eligible
employees may contribute up to 16% of their compensation to an individual
retirement savings account. The Company makes matching contributions equal to
or greater than 50% of employee contributions, not to exceed 3% of employee
compensation. An additional annual matching contribution may be granted at the
discretion of the Company. The Company provides for the PSIP contributions
with its common shares through its leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Program
(“ESOP”).

The ESOP has purchased an aggregate of 24.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock since inception. These purchases have been financed by
10 to 20-year loans from or guaranteed by us. The ESOP’s outstanding
borrowings are reported as long-term debt of the Company and the related
receivables from the ESOP are shown as a reduction of stockholders’ equity.
The loans are repaid by the ESOP from interest earnings on cash balances and
common dividends on shares not yet allocated to participants, common dividends
on certain allocated shares and Company cash contributions. The ESOP loan
maturities and rates are identical to the terms of related Company borrowings.
Stock is made available from the ESOP based on debt service payments on ESOP
borrowings.

Contribution expense for the PSIP for the three years ended 2003 was all
ESOP related. After-tax ESOP expense, including interest expense on ESOP debt,
was $9.2 million, $9.5 million and $9.6 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
Approximately 1.7 million, 1.5 million and 1.8 million shares of common stock
were allocated to plan participants in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Through March 31,
2003, 19.4 million common shares have been allocated to plan participants,
resulting in a balance of 4.8 million common shares in the ESOP which have not
yet been allocated to plan participants.

Healthcare and Life Insurance

In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide healthcare and life
insurance benefits for certain U.S. retired employees. Our policy is to fund
these benefits as claims are paid. The following table presents a
reconciliation of the postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits
obligation:

The discount rates used in determining the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation were 6.75%, 7.25% and 7.5% at March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Expenses for postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits

Foreign pre-tax earnings were $152.2 million, $125.1 million and $30.8
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001. At March 31, 2003, undistributed earnings of
our foreign operations totaling $215.9 million were considered to be
permanently reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been recognized for the
remittance of such earnings to the U.S. since it is our intention to utilize
those earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research
and development activities for an indefinite period of time, or to repatriate
such earnings when it is tax efficient to do so. The determination of the
amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable since the
computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a
decision to repatriate the earnings is made.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Deferred tax balances consisted of the following:

At March 31, 2003, we have an alternative minimum tax credit carry forward
of $38.2 million, which has an indefinite life, and $495.6 million of state
income tax net operating loss carryforwards which will expire at various dates
from 2004 through 2023. We believe that it is more likely than not that the
benefit from these state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.
As a result, we have provided a valuation allowance of $24.2 million at March
31, 2003 on the deferred tax assets relating to these state net operating loss
carryforwards. If this valuation allowance is reversed in the future,
approximately $11.8 million of the tax benefit realized would be credited to
stockholders’ equity.

16. Financial Guarantees and Warranties

Financial Guarantees:

We have agreements with certain of our customers’
financial institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of
inventory at a discount in the event these customers are unable to meet certain
obligations to those financial institutions. Among other limitations, these
inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also guaranteed loans,
credit facilities and the payment of leases for some customers; and we are a
secured lender for substantially all of these guarantees. Customer guarantees
range from one to ten years and were primarily provided to facilitate financing
for certain strategic customers. At March 31, 2003, the maximum amounts of
inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer guarantees were
approximately $150.4 million and $66.5 million. We consider it unlikely that
we would make significant payments under these guarantees, and accordingly,
amounts accrued for these guarantees were nominal.

At March 31, 2003, we had commitments to provide $11.7 million of cash
contributions to Verispan and other equity-held investments and other
commitments of $13.2 million, of which no amounts had been
accrued for.

The expirations of these financial guarantees and commitments are as
follows: $35.9 million, $24.6 million, $6.3 million, $63.4 million, and $2.4
million from 2004 through 2008, and $109.2 million thereafter.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $46.4 million
of standby letters of credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet
the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and
fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability
programs.

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may
provide routine indemnifications (such as retention of previously existing
environmental, tax and employee liabilities) whose terms vary in duration and
often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, obligations for such
indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the amounts of these
indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall
maximum amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than
obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not
historically made significant payments as a result of these indemnifications.

Warranties:

In the normal course of business, we provide certain
warranties and indemnifications for our products and services. We provide
warranties that the pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products we distribute
are in compliance with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other applicable
laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our suppliers,
who customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In addition, we have
indemnity obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been
provided to us from our suppliers, either through express agreement or by
operation of law.

We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and
automation products we sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring
the product into compliance with previously agreed to specifications. For
software products, this may result in additional project costs and/or the
payment of penalties or damages in accordance with the contract and are
reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting for these contracts. In addition, most of our customers who
purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance
agreements. Revenue from these maintenance agreements is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the contract period and the cost of servicing product
warranties is charged to expense when claims become estimable. Accrued
warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.

17. Convertible Preferred Securities

In February 1997, the McKesson Financing Trust, a business trust sponsored
by the Company, issued four million shares of preferred securities to the
public and 123,720 common securities to us, which are convertible at the
holder’s option into McKesson Corporation common stock. The proceeds of such
issuances were invested by the trust in $206,186,000 aggregate principal amount
of our 5% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2027 (the
“Debentures”). The Debentures represent the sole assets of the trust. The
Debentures mature on June 1, 2027, bear interest at an annual rate of 5%,
payable quarterly, and are currently redeemable by us at 102.0% of the
principal amount.

Holders of the securities are entitled to cumulative cash distributions at
an annual rate of 5% of the liquidation amount of $50 per security. Each
preferred security is convertible at the rate of 1.3418 shares of McKesson
Corporation common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The
preferred securities will be redeemed upon repayment of the Debentures and are
callable by us on or after March 4, 2000, in whole or in part, initially at
103.5% of the liquidation preference per share, and thereafter at prices
declining at 0.5% per annum to 100% of the liquidation preference on and after
March 4, 2006 plus, in each case, accumulated, accrued and unpaid
distributions, if any, to the redemption date.

We have guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other
payments due on the preferred securities (the “Guarantee”). The Guarantee,
when taken together with our obligations under the Debentures, and in the
indenture pursuant to which the Debentures were issued, and our obligations
under the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust governing the subsidiary
trust, provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the
preferred securities.

The Debentures and related trust investment in the Debentures have been
eliminated in consolidation and the preferred securities reflected as
outstanding in the consolidated financial statements.

18. Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

I.

Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by McKesson in April, May and July of 1999 that
McKesson had determined that certain software sales transactions in its
Information Solutions segment, formerly HBO & Company (“HBOC”) and now known as
McKesson Information Solutions, Inc., were improperly recorded as revenue and
reversed, as of April 29, 2003, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed against
McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or
directors, and other defendants, including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. (“Bear
Stearns”) and Arthur Andersen LLP (“Arthur Andersen”).

Federal Actions

Sixty-seven of the above mentioned actions have been filed in Federal
Court (the “Federal Actions”). All of the undismissed Federal Actions are
pending before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District
Court (the “Court”) for the Northern District of California. Federal Actions
filed as class actions (excluding the ERISA actions discussed below) have been
consolidated into a single action before Judge Whyte under the caption

In re
McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation

(Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the
“Consolidated Action”). As discussed below, some individual Federal Actions
are also pending before Judge Whyte. By order dated December 22, 1999, Judge
Whyte appointed the New York State Common Retirement Fund as lead plaintiff
(“Lead Plaintiff”) in the Consolidated Action and approved Lead Plaintiff’s
choice of counsel.

After the filing of three consolidated complaints and multiple motions by
multiple defendants challenging the sufficiency of those complaints, the
pleadings in the case have been set with respect to McKesson and HBOC
(motions for reconsideration of prior dismissal orders issued by Judge Whyte
have been filed by Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns and remain pending). The
operative complaint in the Consolidated Action is Lead Plaintiff’s Third
Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint (“TAC”), filed on February 15,
2002. The TAC asserts claims against McKesson and HBOC under Sections 10(b)
and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) in
connection with the events leading to McKesson’s announcements in April, May
and July 1999, and names McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s
current or former officers or directors, Arthur Andersen and Bear Stearns as
defendants. The Section 10(b) claim alleges that McKesson and HBOC
intentionally or with deliberate recklessness misstated the financial
statements of HBOC or McKesson during the class period. The Section 14(a)
claim alleges that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus issued in connection
with a McKesson subsidiary and HBOC merger (the “Merger”) contained material
misstatements or omissions and that McKesson was negligent in issuing the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus with those misstatements. On April 5, 2002,
McKesson filed a motion to dismiss Lead Plaintiff’s claim under Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act to the extent that it is based on McKesson’s pre-Merger
conduct (Lead Plaintiff’s claim under Section 10(b) against McKesson based on
post-Merger conduct had already been sustained by Judge Whyte), and moved to
dismiss the claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act in its entirety.

By order dated January 6, 2003, Judge Whyte granted in part and denied in
part the Company’s motion to dismiss the TAC. Specifically, Judge Whyte
dismissed with prejudice the claim against the Company under Section 10(b) of
the Exchange Act to the extent that claim was based on McKesson’s conduct or
statements prior to the January 12, 1999 merger transaction with HBOC, denied
the Company’s motion to dismiss the claim against the Company under Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act, and ordered the Company to answer the TAC.
Following the Court’s January 6, 2003 orders, the following claims remained
against McKesson and HBOC: (i) a claim against HBOC under Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act; (ii) a claim against McKesson under Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act with respect to post-Merger conduct only; and (iii) a Section 14(a) claim
against McKesson, as described in the Court’s January 6, 2003 order. The
Company and HBOC filed answers to the TAC on March 7, 2003, denying that the
Company or HBOC had violated Section 10(b) or Section 14(a) or that they had
any liability to the alleged plaintiff class.

On March 7, 2003, Lead Plaintiff filed a motion for class certification
seeking to certify a class consisting of (i) all persons and entities who
purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of HBOC during the
period from January 20, 1997, through and including January 12, 1999, (ii) all
persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded
securities or call options, or who sold put options, of McKesson during the
period from October 18, 1998 through and including April 27, 1999, and (iii)
all persons and entities who held McKesson



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

common stock on November 27, 1998 and still held those shares on January
12, 1999. Lead Plaintiff seeks an order appointing three representatives of
this proposed class: (i) the Lead Plaintiff; (ii) City of Miami Beach General
Employees Retirement Trust; and (iii) an individual investor named Donald
Chiert. By agreement of the parties (subject to approval by the Court), the
Company will be required to respond to Lead Plaintiff’s motion for class
certification by August 22, 2003, and the motion will be scheduled to be heard
on October 3, 2003. McKesson and HBOC have commenced the production of
documents in the Consolidated Action and, pursuant to pretrial orders, merits
depositions may begin as early as mid-July 2003. No trial date has been set in
the Consolidated Action.

On January 11, 2001, McKesson filed an action in the Court for the
Northern District of California against the Lead Plaintiff in the Consolidated
Action individually, and as a representative of a defendant class of former
HBOC shareholders who exchanged HBOC shares for Company shares in the January
12, 1999 Merger,

McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State Common Retirement Fund,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. C01-20021 RMW) (the “Complaint and Counterclaim”). In
the Complaint and Counterclaim, the Company alleges that the exchanged HBOC
shares were artificially inflated due to undisclosed accounting improprieties,
and that the exchange ratio therefore provided more shares to former HBOC
shareholders than would have otherwise been the case. In this action, the
Company seeks to recover the “unjust enrichment” received by those HBOC
shareholders who exchanged more than 20,000 HBOC shares in the Merger. The
Company does not allege any wrongdoing by these shareholders. On January 9,
2002, Judge Whyte dismissed the Complaint and Counterclaim with prejudice. The
Company appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”). The Company’s appeal was heard by the Ninth
Circuit on April 8, 2003. The Ninth Circuit has not yet issued an opinion.

By order dated February 7, 2000, Judge Whyte coordinated with the
Consolidated Action a class action alleging claims under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (commonly known as “ERISA”),

Chang v. McKesson
HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-00-20030 RMW), and a shareholder derivative
action that had been filed in the Northern District of California under the
caption

Cohen v. McCall et al.

(Case No. C-99-20916 RMW) with the Consolidated
Action. There has been no further significant activity in the Cohen action.
By stipulated order dated April 30, 2003, no defendant or nominal defendant is
required to respond to the complaint until notified by the plaintiff in writing
with thirty days notice or upon further order of the Court. Recent
developments in the Chang action are discussed below.

Several individual actions have also been filed in, or transferred to, the
Northern District of California. On November 12, 1999, an individual
shareholder action was filed in the Court for the Northern District of
California under the caption

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(C-99-21192
RMW). The Plaintiffs in Jacobs are former HBOC shareholders who acquired their
HBOC shares pursuant to a registration statement issued by HBOC prior to the
Merger, and then exchanged their HBOC shares for McKesson shares in the Merger.
Plaintiffs in Jacobs assert claims under federal and state securities laws and
a claim for common law fraud. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages, and costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. Judge Whyte’s
December 22, 1999, order consolidated the Jacobs action with the Consolidated
Action. With leave of court, the Jacobs plaintiffs amended their complaint,
but the action remains stayed and there has been no discovery, motion practice
or other activity in the case. On September 21, 2000 the plaintiffs in

Jacobs
v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

filed a new individual action entitled

Jacobs v. HBO &
Company

(Case No. C-00-20974 RMW). The Jacobs complaint names only HBOC as a
defendant and asserts claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act,
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and various state law causes of action. The
complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and costs of
suit, including attorneys’ fees. This action has been assigned to Judge Whyte
and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On December 16, 1999, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Bea v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al

. (Case No. C-00-20072 RMW). Plaintiffs in Bea filed an Amended Complaint
on March 9, 2000. Plaintiffs in Bea allege that they acquired the Company’s
common stock prior to the Merger and sold that stock after the April 1999
announcement at a loss. The Bea complaint asserts claims under the federal and
state securities laws, and a claim for fraud. Plaintiffs seek (i) unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, and (ii) reasonable costs and expenses of
suit, including attorneys’ fees. Bea is currently stayed and has been
consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On January 7, 2000, an individual action was filed in the Court for the
Northern District of California under the caption

Cater v. McKesson Corporation
et al.

(Case No. C-00-20327 RMW). The plaintiff is Terry Cater, a former
employee of the Company who alleges that his options and restricted stock were
substantially devalued as a result of



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

the Merger and the subsequent drop in the Company’s stock price.
Plaintiff in Cater asserts claims under the federal securities laws as well as
claims for breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent
misrepresentation. Plaintiff seeks (i) unspecified special damages in excess
of $50,000, (ii) unspecified general damages, (iii) prejudgment interest and
(iv) reasonable attorneys’ fees. The case has been assigned to Judge Whyte and
the parties have stipulated to a stay pending the outcome of the motions to
dismiss in the Consolidated Action.

On February 7, 2000, an action entitled

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et
al.

(Case No. CV 00-0188) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Louisiana. The same plaintiffs then filed a virtually identical
parallel action in Louisiana State Court, Rapides Parish, under the caption

Baker v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al

(filed as Case No. 199018; Case No.
CV-00-0522 after removal to federal court). Plaintiffs, former shareholders of
Automatic Prescription Services, allege claims under the federal securities
laws, and claims for breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and
detrimental reliance. The state court action was removed to federal court and
the two Baker cases have been transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action.

On July 27, 2001, an action was filed in the Court for the Northern
District of California captioned

Pacha, et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(Case No. C01-20713 PVT). The Pacha plaintiffs allege that they were
individual stockholders of McKesson stock on November 27, 1998, and assert that
McKesson and HBOC violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and that
McKesson, aided by HBOC, breached its fiduciary duties to plaintiffs by issuing
a joint proxy statement in connection with the Merger which allegedly contained
false and misleading statements or omissions. Plaintiffs name as defendants
McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or directors of McKesson or
HBOC, Bear Stearns and Arthur Andersen. On November 13, 2001, Judge Whyte
ordered Pacha consolidated with the Consolidated Action and stayed all further
proceedings.

Hess v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

an action filed in state court in
Arizona (Case No. C-20003862) on behalf of former shareholders of Ephrata
Diamond Spring Water Company (“Ephrata”) who acquired McKesson shares in
exchange for their Ephrata stock when McKesson acquired Ephrata in January
1999, was removed to federal court, transferred to the Northern District of
California and consolidated with the Consolidated Action. Judge Whyte also
stayed all further proceedings in Hess except for the filing of an amended
complaint, which was filed on or about December 15, 2001 (the “Hess Amended
Complaint”). The Hess Amended Complaint generally incorporates the allegations
and claims asserted in the Consolidated Action and also includes various common
law causes of action relating to McKesson’s acquisition of Ephrata. The
Company is not currently required to respond to the Hess Amended Complaint.

On June 28, 2001, the Chang plaintiffs filed an amended ERISA class action
complaint against McKesson, HBOC, certain current or former officers or
directors of McKesson or HBOC, and The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase”). The
amended complaint in Chang generally alleges that the defendants breached their
ERISA fiduciary duties in connection with administering the McKesson HBOC
Profit Sharing Investment Plan (the “PSI Plan”) and the HBOC Profit Sharing and
Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”). Plaintiffs in Chang are former
employees of McKesson and participants in the PSI Plan, and purportedly seek
relief under sections 404-405, 409 and 502 of ERISA on behalf of a class
defined to include participants in the PSI Plan, including participants under
the HBOC Plan, who maintained an account balance under the PSI Plan as of April
27, 1999, who had not received a distribution from the PSI Plan as of April 27,
1999, and who suffered losses as a result of the alleged breaches of duty. On
October 12, 2001, McKesson, HBOC and Chase moved to dismiss the Chang action.
The outcome of that motion is discussed below.

On February 7, 2002, a related ERISA class action was filed in the Court
for the Northern District of California captioned

Adams v. McKesson Information
Solutions, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-02-06 85 JCS). Plaintiff in Adams filed a
first amended complaint on March 15, 2002, against HBOC, McKesson, the HBO &
Company Board of Directors, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Administrative Committee, HBO & Company Profit Sharing and Savings Plan
Investment Committee, McKesson HBOC, Inc. Profit Sharing Investment Plan (as a
nominal defendant only), and certain current or former officers, directors or
employees of McKesson or HBOC. Plaintiff alleges that he was a participant in
the HBOC Plan and generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC breached their ERISA
fiduciary duties to the HBOC Plan and its participants or engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiff asserts his claims on behalf of a
putative class defined to include all participants in the HBOC Plan and their
beneficiaries for whose benefit the HBOC Plan acquired HBOC stock from March
31, 1996 to April 1, 1999. Plaintiff seeks (i) a judgment that McKesson and
HBOC breached their fiduciary duties, (ii) an order



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

requiring defendants to restore to the plan all losses caused by these
purported breaches of fiduciary duty, and (iii) reasonable attorneys’ fees,
costs and expenses.

On June 3, 2002, Judge Whyte consolidated the Adams ERISA class action
with the Chang ERISA class action. By order dated September 30, 2002 Judge
Whyte dismissed the First Amended Complaint in the Chang action. Judge Whyte
granted plaintiffs in Chang and Adams 30 days leave to file a consolidated and
amended complaint under the caption

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. ERISA Litigation

(Northern District of California No. C-02-0685 RMW) (the “ERISA Action”). On
December 31, 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint (the
“CAC”) in the ERISA Action. The CAC generally alleges that McKesson and HBOC
breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA, and that HBOC engaged in
transactions prohibited by ERISA. Plaintiffs further allege that McKesson and
HBOC are liable under principles of

respondeat superior

and agency for alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties by other defendants. The CAC seeks to have the
defendants restore to the HBOC Plan and McKesson Plan losses allegedly caused
by their alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees,
costs and expenses. On February 28, 2003, McKesson filed a motion to dismiss
the CAC and HBOC filed motions to dismiss portions of the CAC. The parties
have agreed (subject to approval by the Court) that these motions will be heard
on August 29, 2003.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have also been filed in various state courts in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State
Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State Actions generally allege
misconduct by McKesson or HBOC (and others) in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements.

Two of the State Actions are derivative actions:

Ash, et al. v. McCall,
et al.

, (Case No. 17132), filed in the Delaware Chancery Court and

Mitchell v.
McCall et al.

(Case. No. 304415), filed in California Superior Court, City and
County of San Francisco. McKesson moved to dismiss both of these actions and
to stay the Mitchell action in favor of the earlier filed Ash and Cohen
derivative actions. Plaintiffs in Mitchell agreed to defer any action by the
court on McKesson’s motions pending resolution of McKesson’s dismissal motion
in Ash. On September 15, 2000, in the Ash case, the Court of Chancery
dismissed all causes of action with leave to re-plead certain of the dismissed
claims, and on January 22, 2001, the Ash plaintiffs filed a Third Amended
Complaint which is presently the subject of McKesson’s motion to dismiss.

Five of the State Actions are class actions. Three of these were filed in
the Delaware Court of Chancery:

Derdiger v. Tallman et al.

(Civil Action No.
17276),

Carroll v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 17454) and

Kelly v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Civil Action No. 17282). Two additional actions
were filed in the Delaware Superior Court:

Edmondson v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action No. 99-951) and

Caravetta v. McKesson HBOC, Inc.

(Civil Action
No. 00C-04-214 WTQ). The Carroll and Kelly actions have been voluntarily
dismissed without prejudice. McKesson removed Edmondson to federal court in
Delaware and filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the federal court
on March 5, 2002. McKesson filed motions to stay the Derdiger and Caravetta
actions in favor of proceedings in the federal Consolidated Action, which were
granted. On December 20, 2001, the plaintiff in Derdiger moved to vacate the
stay of that action. In a series of rulings dated September 9, 2002, October
11, 2002 and October 18, 2002, the court denied plaintiff’s motion to vacate
the stay with respect to any class claims but granted plaintiff leave to
proceed with his individual claims. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion
for partial summary judgment, and the former directors of Access Health, Inc.,
who are also defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the claims asserted against
them. The parties have asked the court to defer consideration of those motions
while they pursue settlement discussions.

Several of the State Actions are individual actions which have been filed
in various state courts. Five of these were filed in the California Superior
Court, City and County of San Francisco:

Yurick v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et
al.

(Case No. 303857),

The State of Oregon by and through the Oregon Public
Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 307619),

Utah State Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. 311269),

Minnesota State Board of Investment v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
311747), and

Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. CGC-02-405792). Oregon, Utah, and Minnesota and Merrill
Lynch have been consolidated before the Honorable Donald S. Mitchell under the
Oregon caption.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In Yurick, the trial court sustained McKesson’s demurrer to the original
complaint without leave to amend with respect to all causes of action except
plaintiffs’ claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation, which
remain in the case. On December 27, 2002, the Yurick action was assigned to
Judge Mitchell, the presiding judge in the Oregon, Minnesota, Utah and Merrill
Lynch actions.

The Oregon, Utah and Minnesota actions referenced above are individual
securities actions filed in the California Superior Court for the City and
County of San Francisco by the out-of-state pension funds for each of those
States and Colorado. On October 16, 2002, after motion practice to challenge
the sufficiency of the complaints in Utah, Minnesota and Oregon, which resulted
in the dismissal of a number of claims that had been asserted against McKesson
and HBOC, and the consolidation of those actions under the caption

The State of
Oregon Public Employees Retirement Board v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Master
File No. 307619), plaintiffs in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah filed a consolidated
and amended complaint (the “CAAC”) which consolidated the remaining claims in
those actions. On October 11, 2002, plaintiffs in Merrill Lynch filed an
amended complaint in the Merrill Lynch action.

On March 13, 2003, Judge Mitchell overruled McKesson’s and HBOC’s
demurrers to and motions to strike the CAAC in Oregon, Minnesota and Utah. On
the same date, Judge Mitchell sustained in part and overruled in part McKesson
and HBOC’s demurrers, and denied McKesson and HBOC’s motions to strike the
amended complaint in Merrill Lynch. Following those orders, the following
claims remain against McKesson and HBOC in the consolidated Oregon action: (i)
under California law, for violation of California Corporations Code §
25000/25400, for violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200
(against HBOC only), and for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation,
and (ii) under Georgia law, claims for conspiracy under Georgia’s RICO statute,
and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, and aiding
and abetting. Following the Court’s March 13, 2003, orders, the following
claims remain against McKesson and HBOC in the Merrill Lynch action: (i) under
California law, for violation of California Corporations Code § 25000/25400,
for violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200 (against HBOC
only), and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy and
aiding and abetting, (ii) under New Jersey law, for conspiracy to violate New
Jersey’s RICO statute (HBOC only), and (iii) under Georgia law, for violation
of Georgia’s securities laws. The Court’s March 13, 2003, orders also gave the
Merrill Lynch plaintiffs leave to amend their previously-asserted claims
against McKesson for violation of New Jersey’s RICO statute and against
McKesson and HBOC for conspiracy to violate New Jersey’s and Georgia’s RICO
statutes. On April 8, 2003, the Merrill Lynch plaintiffs moved for
reconsideration of certain of Judge Mitchell’s March 13, 2003, orders,
including certain orders sustaining demurrers by McKesson and HBOC. Neither
McKesson nor HBOC is obligated to answer the CAAC or the complaint in the
Merrill Lynch action until after the court rules on the Merrill Lynch
plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration.

Several individual actions have been filed in various state courts outside
of California. Several of these cases have been filed in Georgia state courts.
On December 9, 1999, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Gwinnett
County, under the caption

Adler v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
99-C-7980-3). Plaintiff in Adler, a former HBOC shareholder, asserted claims
for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance. The Adler action named as
defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. Plaintiff
sought damages in excess of $43 million, as well as punitive damages, and costs
of suit, including attorneys’ fees. The case was settled following discovery,
and plaintiff filed a Dismissal with Prejudice on July 17, 2002.

On October 24, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Suffolk Partners Limited Partnership et al. v. McKesson HBOC,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 00VS010469A). Plaintiffs in the Suffolk action allegedly
purchased the Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999
announcement. Plaintiffs assert claims under Georgia’s securities and
racketeering laws, and for common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The Suffolk action names as defendants
the Company, HBOC, and certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former
officers or directors, and Arthur Andersen. Like the Consolidated Action, the
claims in the Suffolk action generally arise out of the January 12, 1999
Merger, and the Company’s announcement of the need to restate its financial
statements. Plaintiffs seek (i) compensatory damages of approximately $21.8
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Company and HBOC separately answered the complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Suffolk
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. On August 2,
2001, the Court granted the motions to stay. Subsequently, however, in May



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

2003, the Court lifted the stay and directed the parties to coordinate
discovery with that in the Consolidated Action and several other actions. The
Company’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is set for hearing on June 18,
2003.

On November 1, 2000, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
00 VS 010801). Plaintiff in the Curran action allegedly purchased the
Company’s common stock after the Merger but before the April 1999 announcement.
The claims in the Curran action are identical to the claims in the Suffolk
action. Plaintiff seeks (i) compensatory damages of approximately $2.6
million, as well as general, rescissory, special, punitive, exemplary, and with
respect to certain causes of action, treble damages, and (ii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees. The Curran action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, and
certain of the Company’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and
Arthur Andersen. The Company and HBOC separately answered the Complaint on
January 9, 2001. The Company and HBOC moved for an order staying the Curran
action in favor of the Consolidated Action on January 10, 2001. The Court
granted the motions to stay on August 22, 2001.

On December 12, 2001, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, captioned

Drake v. McKesson Corp., et al.

(Case No. 01VS026303A).
Plaintiff in Drake is a former HBOC employee seeking lost commissions as well
as asserting claims under Georgia’s securities and racketeering laws, and
various common law causes of action. Plaintiff seeks (i) approximately
$300,000 in unpaid commissions, (ii) unspecified compensatory, consequential,
actual, exemplary, and punitive damages, and (iii) prejudgment and
post-judgment interest and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
The Drake action names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and
Jay Gilbertson. The parties entered into a Consent Order for Partial Stay on
February 27, 2002, which stayed Plaintiff’s Georgia securities law, fraud and
RICO claims. On March 4, 2002, McKesson and McKesson Information Solutions
Inc. separately filed their answers. The case is in the discovery stage and is
proceeding on the plaintiff’s claims for unpaid commissions.

Two similar Georgia actions have been consolidated for purposes of
discovery and may be consolidated for purposes of trial. On January 31, 2002,
an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court, Fulton County, under the caption

Holcombe T. Green and HTG Corp. v. McKesson, Inc. et al.

(Case No.
2002-CV-48407). Plaintiffs in the

Green

action are former HBOC shareholders.
Plaintiff Holcombe Green was also a former officer, chairman and director of
HBOC. On February 6, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia Superior Court,
Fulton County, under the caption

Hall Family Investments, L.P. v. McKesson,
Inc. et al.

(Case No. 2002-CV-48612). Plaintiff in the Hall action is a former
HBOC shareholder. One of the limited partners of the Hall Plaintiff is Nancy
Hall Green, the wife of Holcombe Green. The complaints in the Green and Hall
actions are substantially identical. In each action, Plaintiffs asserted
claims for common law fraud and fraudulent conveyance and named as defendants
the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson. In each action,
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $100 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’ fees. The Company and HBOC filed their respective answers and
counterclaims on April 22, 2002. HBOC also filed a third party complaint
against Holcombe Green for indemnification. The Company and HBOC also filed
motions to stay and dismiss. The court denied the motions to stay, and
partially granted the motions to dismiss, dismissing Plaintiffs’ claims for
fraudulent conveyance. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaims filed by
the Company and HBOC, and the Court denied those motions. Discovery is under
way and will proceed for some time.

On May 8, 2002, an action was filed in Georgia State Court, Fulton County,
under the caption

James Gilbert v. McKesson Corporation, et al.

(Case No.
02VS032502C). Plaintiff, formerly the general counsel of HBOC, alleges he was
a holder of options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock. The action
names as defendants the Company, HBOC, Albert Bergonzi and Jay Gilbertson.
Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages of approximately $2 million, as well as
unspecified general, special and punitive damages, and costs of suit, including
attorneys’ fees. On June 24, 2002, the Company and HBOC filed their respective
answers, motions to stay, and motions to dismiss. On November 26, 2002, the
court granted the motions to stay, and this case is stayed until final
disposition of the Consolidated Action.

On September 28, 1999, an action was filed in the Delaware Superior Court
under the caption

Kelly v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et. al.

(Civil Action No.
99C-09-265 WCC). Plaintiffs in Kelly are former shareholders of KWS&P, Inc.
and KWS&P/SFA, Inc., which companies were acquired by McKesson in 1999. The
plaintiffs assert claims under the federal securities laws as well as claims
for breach of contract. On January 17, 2002, the court denied McKesson’s
motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary
judgment, while

granting motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction that were
filed by certain former officers and directors of McKesson and HBOC. As of May
30, 2003, the parties have agreed to a settlement of this action, and the case
will be dismissed with prejudice.

The
United States Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) and the SEC are conducting
investigations into the matters leading to the restatement. On May 15, 2000,
the USAO filed a one-count information against
former HBOC officer, Dominick DeRosa, charging Mr. DeRosa with aiding and
abetting securities fraud, and on May 15, 2000, Mr. DeRosa entered a guilty
plea to that charge. On September 28, 2000, an indictment was unsealed in the
Northern District of California against former HBOC officer, Jay P. Gilbertson,
and former Company and HBOC officer, Albert J. Bergonzi,

United States v.
Bergonzi, et al.

(Case No. CR-00-0505). On that same date, a civil complaint
was filed by the SEC against Mr. Gilbertson, Mr. Bergonzi and Mr. DeRosa

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gilbertson, et al.

(Case No. C-00-3570).
Mr. DeRosa has settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the
substantive allegations of the complaint. On January 10, 2001, the grand jury
returned a superseding indictment in the Northern District of California
against Messrs. Gilbertson and Bergonzi

United States v. Bergonzi, et al.

(Case
No. CR-00-0505) and on June 4, 2003, a second superseding
indictment was unsealed which added new charges against
Mr. Bergonzi and which also charged both former Chairman of the
Board of HBOC and the Company, Charles W. McCall, and former HBOC
General Counsel, Jay Lapine, with various securities law violations.
Also on June 4, 2003, the USAO announced the filing of
agreements with Messrs. Gilbertson, DeRosa and former Senior
Vice President for Finance, Timothy Heyerdahl to plead guilty to
various securities law violations (Case Nos. CR-00-0505,
CR-00-0213 and CR-01-0002, respectively).

On September 27, 2001, the SEC filed securities fraud charges
against six former HBOC officers and employees including
Messrs. Heyerdahl and Lapine. Simultaneous with the filing
of the Commission’s civil complaints, four of the six defendants settled the
claims brought against them by, among other things, consenting, without
admitting or denying the allegations of the complaints, to entry of permanent
injunctions against all of the alleged violations, and agreed to pay civil
penalties in various amounts. On June 4, 2003, the SEC filed a
civil complaint against Mr. McCall for various securities law
violations (Case No. C-03-2603). On January 3, 2002, the Company was notified in
writing by the SEC that its investigation has been terminated as to the
Company, and that no enforcement action has been recommended to the Commission.

We do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings, or to estimate the amounts
of, or potential range of, loss with respect to those proceedings. In
addition, the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain.
The range of possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments
against the Company or settlements that could require substantial payments by
the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on McKesson’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigation and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of
business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal
actions for product liability and other damages, investigations relating to
governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal
conduct of our business. These include:

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc., is one of many defendants
in approximately 110 cases in which plaintiffs claim that they were injured due
to exposure, over many years, to latex proteins in gloves manufactured by
numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors, including
McKesson Medical-Surgical. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its
suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major
suppliers. McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc.’s insurers are providing coverage
for these cases, subject to applicable deductibles.

We, along with more than 100 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit
brought in 2000 by the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (“the
Foundation”) alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven U.S.
patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the
automated management and control of product inventory, warehousing,
distribution and point-of-sale transactions. Due to the pendency of earlier
litigation brought against the Foundation by the manufacturers of bar code
devices attacking the validity of the patents at issue, the court stayed the
suit against us until the conclusion of the earlier case, including any appeals
that may be taken. The trial in this earlier case concluded in January 2003
and the parties are awaiting the decision. An appeal is
anticipated regardless of the outcome. While the suit against us was stayed,
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petitions for reexamination of
three of the seven patents asserted by the Foundation against us. The
reexamination will determine, among other things, whether these patents have
expired. Each of the remaining four patents in the action has already expired
by its own terms, or by the Foundation’s disclaiming the remaining portion of
the patent’s life.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

We, through our former McKesson Chemical Company division (the “Former
Division”), have been named a defendant in 52 cases filed in state courts in
Mississippi as a result of the Former Division’s alleged distribution of
asbestos. These cases typically involve multiple plaintiffs claiming personal
injuries and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against numerous
defendants arising from the plaintiffs’ alleged exposure to asbestos-containing
materials. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into at the time of the
1986 sale of McKesson Chemical Company to what is now called Univar USA Inc.
(“Univar”), we have tendered each of these actions to Univar. Univar is
currently defending us but has raised questions concerning the extent of its
obligations under the indemnification agreement. Discussions with Univar on
that subject are ongoing. McKesson has not paid or incurred any costs or
expenses in connection with these actions to date; and the Company continues to
look to Univar for defense and full indemnification of these claims. In
addition, McKesson believes that, if necessary, a portion of these claims would
be covered by insurance.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois
is conducting an industry-wide civil and criminal investigation into the
marketing, sale and Medicare reimbursement of enteral nutritional products
(“Products”) and has indicated that the Company and two of our employees are
subjects of the investigation. The Products are sold, and the individuals are
employed by the extended care business conducted by McKesson Medical-Surgical
Minnesota Supply Inc., an indirect subsidiary of the Company. We are
cooperating with the investigation and responding to subpoenas which have been
issued to the Company.

Environmental Matters

Primarily
as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses,
which were fully divested by 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations. We have received claims and demands from
governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly
required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at five sites
where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations; and we, by
administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain actions at those
sites, including soil and groundwater remediation.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with
outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of
reasonably possible remediation costs for these five sites is approximately $12
million, net of approximately $2 million that third parties have agreed to
pay in settlement or we expect, based either on agreements or
nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third
parties. The $12 million is expected to be paid out between April 2003 and
March 2028. Our liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a potentially responsible party,
or PRP, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law or its state law
equivalent) for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our
alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 22 sites. With respect to each of
these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and, while the
current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon
PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with
other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 22 sites is approximately $1.3
million. The aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in Superfund matters
to date have not been significant. The accompanying consolidated balance
sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain
due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup
costs; the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportions to other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs are
recoverable from insurance or other parties.

While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the
ultimate outcome of any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed
under this section II, “Other Litigation and Claims,” we believe, based on
current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that such litigation and
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

19. Stockholders’ Equity

Each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock is permitted one vote
on proposals presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any
dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”). In July 2002, our stockholders approved an amendment to the
Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized common shares from
400 million to 800 million shares.

In 1995, the
Board declared a dividend of one right (a “Right”) for each of the then
outstanding shares and subsequently issued shares of common stock to purchase,
upon the occurrence of certain specified triggering events, a unit consisting
of one hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
Triggering events include, without limitation, the acquisition by another
entity of 15% or more of our common stock without the prior approval of our
Board. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and will cause
substantial dilution to the ownership interest of a person or group that
attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by the Board. The Rights expire
in 2004 unless redeemed earlier by the Board. As a result of a two-for-one
stock split in 1998, each share of common stock now has attached to it one-half
of a Right.

In 2001, the Board approved plans to repurchase up to $250.0 million of
common stock. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we repurchased 0.9 million, 1.3 million
and 2.2 million shares for $25.0 million, $44.2 million and $65.6 million, or a
total of $134.8 million. The repurchased shares will be used for general
corporate purposes.

We have several equity compensation plans (stock option, restricted stock
and stock purchase plans) for the benefit of certain officers, directors and employees. As a result of acquisitions, we also
have 20 other option plans under which no further awards have been made since
the date of acquisition. Under the active equity compensation plans, we were
authorized to grant up to 117.3 million shares as of March 31, 2003, of which
88.1 million shares have been granted.

Options are generally granted for the purchase of shares of common stock
at an exercise price not less than market value on the date of grant. Most
options vest over four years, subject to continuous employment and certain
other conditions. Options generally expire ten years after the grant date.

The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) under which
11.1 million shares have been authorized for issuance. Eligible employees may
purchase a limited number of shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount
of up to 15% of the market value at certain plan-defined dates. In 2003, 2002
and 2001, 1.5 million, 1.6 million and 1.0 million shares were issued under the
ESPP. At March 31, 2003, 6.3 million shares were available for issuance under
the ESPP.

20. Related Party Balances and Transactions

We had outstanding notes receivable from certain of our current and
former officers and senior managers totaling $84.4 million, $85.5 million and
$90.7 million at March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 related to purchases of common
stock under our various employee stock purchase plans. These notes, which are
included in other capital in the consolidated balance sheets, were issued for
amounts equal to the market value of the stock on the date of the purchase and
are full recourse to the borrower. As of March 31, 2003, the value of the
underlying stock collateral was $36.5 million. The notes bear interest at
rates ranging from 2.7% to 8.0% and are due at various dates through February
2004. The Company evaluates the collectability of these notes on an
ongoing basis. Other receivable balances held with related parties, consisting of loans
made to certain officers and senior managers, at March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
amounted to $6.6 million, $6.4 million and
$5.5 million. In addition, we purchased $3.0 million of services from Verispan in
2003.
