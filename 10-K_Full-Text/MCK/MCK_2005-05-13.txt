productivity and minimizing the liability and cost associated with workplace illnesses and
injuries. In addition, this segment includes Moore Medical Corp. (“MMC”), an Internet-enabled,
multi-channel marketer and distributor of medical-surgical and pharmaceutical products to
non-hospital provider settings, which we acquired in 2005.

Provider Technologies

Our Provider Technologies segment provides a comprehensive portfolio of software, automation,
support and services to help healthcare organizations improve patient safety, reduce the cost and
variability of care, and better manage their resources and revenue stream. The segment markets its
products and services to integrated delivery networks, hospitals, physician group practices, home
health providers, and managed care providers. Approximately sixty percent of hospital-based
integrated delivery networks in the U.S. use one or more products from this segment. The segment
also sells its solutions internationally through subsidiaries and/or distribution agreements in
Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and Puerto
Rico.

The product portfolio for the Provider Technologies segment is organized into three major
solutions sets — clinical solutions, business performance solutions and automation solutions — with
a variety of subsets of these solutions designed to address specific healthcare business issues
(such as, physician access and medication safety.) To ensure that organizations achieve the
maximum value for their information technology investment, the Provider Technologies segment also
offers a wide range of services to support the implementation and use of solutions as



McKESSON CORPORATION

well as assist with business and clinical redesign, process re-engineering and staffing (both
information technology and back-office).

Clinical Solutions

. The segment’s clinical solutions are designed to enable organizations to
improve medication safety, accelerate physician use of healthcare information technology, improve
care team efficiency and reduce variability in healthcare quality and costs. The clinical
management solution set, known as Horizon Clinicals

TM

, is built using architecture to
facilitate integration and enable modular deployment of systems. It includes a clinical data
repository, document imaging, medical imaging, clinical decision support/physician order entry,
point-of-care documentation with bar-coded medication administration, enterprise laboratory,
radiology and pharmacy, an emergency department solution and a comprehensive ambulatory system that

to facilitate physician access to patient information such as a Web-based physician portal and
wireless devices that draw on information from the hospital’s information systems. In addition,
the segment provides solutions to address patients’ needs for information both inside and outside
the hospital.

Business Performance Solutions.

The segment’s business performance solutions support revenue
cycle management and resource management. The segment’s revenue cycle solution is designed to
reduce days in accounts receivable, prevent insurance claim denials, reduce costs and improve
productivity for our customers. Solutions include contract management, electronic claims
processing and coding compliance checking. The segment’s hospital information systems also play a
key role in managing the revenue cycle by working with these solutions to automate the operation of
individual departments and their respective functions within the inpatient environment. The
segment’s resource management solutions consist of an integrated suite of applications that enhance
an organization’s ability to forecast and optimize enterprise-wide use of resources (labor,
supplies, equipment and facilities) associated with the delivery of care. These solutions help
automate and link resource requirements to care protocols designed to increase profitability,
enhance decision-making, and improve business processes.

Automation Solutions

. This segment provides market-leading automation technologies that help
hospitals to re-engineer and improve their medication use and supply management processes.
Examples include centralized pharmacy automation for unit-dose medications, unit-based cabinet
technologies for secure medication storage and rapid retrieval, point-of-use supply automation
systems for inventory management and revenue capture, and an automated medication administration
system for ensuring accuracy at the point of care. Based on a foundation of bar-code scanning
technology, these integrated solutions are designed to reduce errors and bring new levels of safety
to patients nationwide.

In addition to the product offerings described above, the Provider Technologies segment offers
a comprehensive range of services to help organizations derive greater value from, and enhance
satisfaction and return on investment throughout the life of the solutions implemented. The range
of services includes:

Technology Services

. The segment has worked with numerous healthcare organizations to support
the smooth operation of their information systems by providing the technical infrastructure
designed to maximize application accessibility, availability, security and performance.

Professional Services

. Professional services help customers achieve business results from
their software or automation investment. The segment offers a wide array of quality service
options, including consulting for business and/or clinical process improvement and re-design as
well as implementation, project management, technical, and education services relating to all
products in the Provider Technologies segment.

Outsourcing Services

. The segment helps organizations focus their resources where needed
while the segment manages their information technology or revenue cycle operations through
outsourcing. Outsourcing service options include managing hospital data processing operations, as
well as strategic information systems planning and management, revenue cycle processes, payroll
processing, business office administration, and major system conversions.

Acquisitions, Investments and Divestiture

We have undertaken strategic initiatives in recent years designed to further focus on our core
healthcare businesses and enhance our competitive position. These initiatives are detailed in
Financial Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, “Acquisitions and Investments”
and “Divestiture,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Competition

In every area of healthcare distribution operations, our Pharmaceutical Solutions and
Medical-Surgical Solutions segments face strong competition, both in price and service, from
national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service
merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution and large
payor organizations. In addition, these segments face competition from various other service
providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers (as well as other potential
customers of the segments) which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal
needs, supply management capabilities which are provided by the segments and other competing
service providers. Price, quality of service, and, in some cases, convenience to the customer are
generally the principal competitive elements in these segments.

Our Provider Technologies segment experiences substantial competition from many firms,
including other computer services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain
hospitals and hospital groups, hardware vendors and Internet-based companies with technology
applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition varies in size from small to large companies,
in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.

Other Information About the Business

Customers

. In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a
limited number of large customers. During 2005, sales to our largest customer, Rite Aid
Corporation, and ten largest customers accounted for approximately 10% and 50% of our total
consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2005, accounts receivable from Rite Aid Corporation and our
ten largest customers were approximately 7% and 49% of total accounts receivable. The majority of
these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Suppliers.

During 2005, the U.S. Healthcare pharmaceutical distribution and services business
entered into restructured distribution agreements with certain pharmaceutical manufacturers that
modify the way we are compensated for our distribution and other related logistic and
administrative services and data. This transition in our business was due, in part, to increasing
efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control or limit the product availability in the supply
channels. Historically, a significant portion of the U.S. Healthcare’s gross margin has been
derived from purchasing branded product inventory in advance of pharmaceutical price increases and
holding this inventory until a price increase occurred, thereby generating a larger gross margin
upon the sale of the product to customers (“Buy and Hold”). In more recent years, we also entered
into inventory management agreements (“IMA”) with certain manufacturers whereby we were paid for
not building investment inventories in advance of a price increase. Under both the Buy and Hold
and IMA, gross margin dollars were predicated upon pharmaceutical price increases which contributed
to volatility in the U.S. Healthcare pharmaceutical distribution and services historical gross
margins.

Throughout 2005, we have been actively working with pharmaceutical manufacturers to
restructure our distribution agreements towards a more fee-based approach whereby we are
appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. Under these fee-based
agreements, all or a significant portion of our compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers is
fixed and is no longer dependent upon pharmaceutical price increases. We have made progress
towards this objective and expect to be complete by mid-2006. Upon completion, we expect more than
80% of our pharmaceutical manufacturer compensation will not be affected by price inflation.

Research and Development.

Our research and development (“R&D”) expenditures primarily consist
of our investment in software development held for sale. We expended $231.5 million, $230.4
million, and $203.2 million for R&D activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003, and of these amounts, we
capitalized 21%, 25% and 26%. R&D expenditures are primarily incurred by our Provider Technologies
segment, Payor Group and Retail Automation businesses. Our Provider Technologies segment’s product
development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific
information processing needs of hospitals. We believe a substantial and sustained commitment to
such expenditures is important to the long-term success of this business. Additional information
regarding our R&D activities is included in Financial Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, “Significant Accounting Policies,” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental Legislation

. We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained
responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection
Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed
sites. These matters are described further in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. Other than any capital expenditures that may be required in connection with those
legal matters, we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for
environmental issues, or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. The
amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2005 and is not
expected to be material in the next year.

Employees

. On March 31, 2005, we employed approximately 25,200 persons compared to 24,600 in
2004 and 24,500 in 2003.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales.

Information as
to foreign operations is included in Financial Notes 1 and 22 to the consolidated financial
statements, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Segments of Business,” appearing in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Item 2. Properties

Because of the nature of our principal businesses, plant, warehousing, office and other
facilities are operated in widely dispersed locations. The warehouses are typically owned or
leased on a long-term basis. We consider our operating properties to be in satisfactory condition
and adequate to meet our needs for the next several years without making capital expenditures
materially higher than historical levels. Information as to material lease commitments is included
in Financial Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, “Lease Obligations,” appearing in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

I. Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by McKesson in April, May and July of 1999 that McKesson had
determined that certain software sales transactions in its Information Solutions segment, formerly
HBO & Company (“HBOC”) and now known as McKesson Information Solutions LLC, were improperly
recorded as revenue and reversed, as of March 31, 2005, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed against
McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and other
defendants, including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. and Arthur Andersen LLP.

Federal Actions

On January 12, 2005, we announced that we reached an agreement to settle the
previously-reported class action in the Northern District of California captioned:

In re McKesson
HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation

(Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”) pending
before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District Court (the “Court”) for the
Northern District of California. In general, under the agreement to settle the Consolidated
Action, we will pay the settlement class a total of $960 million in cash and accordingly, in the
third quarter of 2005, we accrued this amount. The settlement will resolve the Consolidated Action
as to all defendants, other than Arthur Andersen LLP and Bear Stearns & Co Inc. Other previously
reported federal and state cases are not resolved by the settlement. The settlement agreement is
subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, preliminary approval by the Court,
notice to the Class and final approval by the Court after a hearing. Judge Whyte held a hearing on
March 25, 2005, to determine whether to grant preliminary approval of the settlement, but has not
yet issued a decision.

The previously-reported individual actions in the Northern District of California captioned

Jacobs v. McKesson HBOC, Inc., et al.

(C-99-21192 RMW),

Jacobs v. HBO & Company

(Case No.
C-00-20974 RMW),

(Case No. C01-20713 PVT), and

Hess v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. C-20003862), remain stayed and are consolidated with the
Consolidated Action.

The related federal class action,

In re McKesson HBOC Inc. ERISA Litigation

(Northern District
of California No. C-02-0685 RMW) (the “ERISA Action”), pending before Judge Whyte, involves ERISA
claims brought on behalf of the HBOC Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”) and the
McKesson Profit Sharing and Investment Plan (the “McKesson Plan”), as well as participants in those
plans. On May 6, 2005, a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement was executed for that portion of
the ERISA Action that involves HBOC Plan claims. The proposed settlement resolves all claims by
the HBOC Plan and its participants in consideration of an $18.2 million cash payment by the
Company. The settlement is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, notice to
the class and final approval by the Court. Judge Whyte has scheduled a hearing on final approval
of the HBOC Plan settlement for September 9, 2005. The separate ERISA claims of the McKesson Plan
and its participants are not resolved by this settlement. The Company’s motion to dismiss those
claims remains pending before this Court.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have been filed in various state courts in California, Colorado, Delaware,
Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State
Actions generally allege misconduct by McKesson or HBOC (and others) in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements. Ten of those state court
actions remain pending in California and Georgia.

In the previously-reported actions pending in California Superior Court captioned

(Case No. 311747),

and Merrill Lynch Fundamental Growth Fund et al. v.
McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Case No. CGC-02-405792) (“Merrill Lynch”), the trial court has set a
trial date of October 3, 2005. The Merrill Lynch plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment on
their common law fraud claim, and the hearing on that motion is presently set for July 1, 2005.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Five previously-reported actions remain pending in Georgia state courts:

Suffolk Partners
Limited Partnership et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Georgia State Court, Fulton County, Case
No. 00VS010469A);

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Georgia State Court, Fulton
County, Case No. 00 VS 010801);

James Gilbert v.
McKesson Corporation, et al.

(Georgia State Court, Fulton County, Case No. 02VS032502C). The
allegations in these actions are substantially similar to those in the Consolidated Action. The
Company and HBOC have answered the complaints in each of these actions, generally denying the
allegations and any liability to plaintiffs. The

Green

and

Hall Family Investments

actions have
been consolidated for purposes of discovery and may be consolidated for purposes of trial.
Discovery in the

Suffolk Partners

, and

Hall Family Investments

actions is
proceeding in coordination with the Consolidated Action. The

Gilbert

action has been stayed until
final disposition of the Consolidated Action. No trial date has been set for any of these actions.

As a result of the Company’s various pretrial motions, only a single post-merger accounting
oversight claim against the directors of post-merger McKesson remains to be litigated in the
previously-reported action captioned:

Saito, et. al. v. McCall

(Civil Action No. 17132). The
Company filed its answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint in

Saito

on February 8, 2005. The parties
are currently engaged in discovery. No trial date has been set.

On March 30, 2004, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California
filed a three count indictment against former McKesson Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Richard H. Hawkins, charging him with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud,
securities fraud, and making false statements to an accountant. On March 31, 2004, Hawkins pled
not guilty to the charges. The Hawkins court trial closed on March 11, 2005. No verdict has yet
been issued.

During the third quarter of 2005, we established an additional reserve of $240 million, which
the Company believes will be adequate to address its remaining potential exposure with respect to
all other previously reported Accounting Litigation, including the State Actions discussed above.
That sum includes the proposed $18.2 million settlement amount in the HBOC Plan ERISA Action noted
above. However, in view of the number of remaining cases, the uncertainties of the timing and
outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial amounts involved, it is possible that the
ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve. The range of possible
resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against the Company or settlements that
could require payments by the Company in addition to the reserve, which could have a material
adverse impact on McKesson’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigations and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject
to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for product liability and other
damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out
of the normal conduct of our business. These include:

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., is one of multiple defendants in approximately
11 cases in which plaintiffs claim they were injured due to exposure, over many years, to latex
proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of
distributors, including McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to
its suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers.

We, along with more than 100 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit brought in 2000 by
the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (the “Foundation”) alleging that we and our
subsidiaries are infringing seven (7) U.S. patents relating to common bar code scanning technology
and its use for the automated management and control of product inventory, warehousing,
distribution and point-of-sale transactions. Due to the pendency of earlier litigation brought
against the Foundation by the manufacturers of bar code devices attacking the validity of the
patents at issue, the court stayed the suit against the Company until the conclusion of the earlier
case, including any appeals that may be taken. The trial in this earlier case concluded in January
2003 and the court subsequently ruled that each of the patents at issue was unenforceable due to
prosecutorial laches. The case is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. It is
anticipated that oral argument will not occur before May of 2005. While the suit against the
Company was stayed, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted petitions for reexamination



McKESSON CORPORATION

of 3 of the 7 patents asserted by the Foundation against the Company. The reexamination will
determine, among other things, whether these patents have expired. Each of the remaining 4 patents
in the action has already expired by its own terms, or by the Foundation’s disclaiming the
remaining portion of the patent’s life.

The Company is a defendant in approximately 110 California cases alleging that the plaintiffs
were injured by Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory drug manufactured by Merck & Company (“Merck”). The
cases typically assert causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty and
false advertising for improper design, testing, manufacturing, and warnings relating to the
manufacture and distribution of Vioxx. None of the cases involving the Company is scheduled for
trial. The Company has tendered each of these cases to Merck and has reached an agreement with
Merck to defend and indemnify the Company.

The Company is a defendant in approximately 42 cases alleging that the plaintiffs were injured
because they took the drugs known as fen-phen, the term commonly used to describe the weight-loss
combination of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with phentermine. The Company has been named as a
defendant along with several other defendants in 41 cases; and has accepted the tender of one of
its customers named as defendant in the one remaining case. The cases are pending in state courts
in California and Mississippi and in state and federal courts in Florida and New York, and
typically assert causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, false
advertising and unfair business practices for improper design, testing, manufacturing and warnings
relating to the distribution and/or prescription of fen-phen. The Company has tendered each of
these cases to its suppliers and has reached an agreement with its major supplier to defend and
indemnify the Company and its customers.

We, through our former McKesson Chemical Company division, are named in approximately 200
cases involving the alleged distribution of asbestos. These cases typically involve either single
or multiple plaintiffs claiming personal injuries and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages
as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement
signed at the time of the 1986 sale of McKesson Chemical Company to what is now called Univar USA
Inc. (“Univar”), we have tendered each of these actions to Univar. Univar has raised questions
concerning the extent of its obligations under the indemnification agreement, and while Univar
continues to defend us in many of these cases, it has been rejecting our tenders of new cases since
February 2005. We believe Univar remains obligated for all tendered cases under the terms of the
indemnification agreement, however we are beginning to incur defense costs in connection with these
more recently-served actions. We also believe that a portion of the claims against us will be
covered by insurance, and we are pursuing the available coverage.

On May 3, 2004, judgment was entered against the Company and one of its employees in the
action

Roby v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Superior Court of Yolo County, California, Case No.
CV01-573). Former employee Charlene Roby brought claims for wrongful termination, disability
discrimination and disability-based harassment against the Company and a claim for disability-based
harassment against her former supervisor. The jury awarded Roby compensatory damages in the amount
of $3.5 million against the Company and $0.5 million against her supervisor, and punitive damages
in the amount of $15.0 million against the Company and a nominal amount against her supervisor.
Following post-trial motions, the trial court reduced the amount of compensatory damages against
the Company to $2.8 million; the punitive damages awarded against both defendants and the
compensatory damages awarded against the individual employee defendant were not reduced. On
October 18, 2004, the trial court awarded Roby her attorney’s fees in the amount of $0.7 million.
The Company has filed a Notice of Appeal, seeking reduction or reversal of the compensatory and
punitive damage awards and the award of attorney’s fees. If these efforts are not successful, the
judgment in this case could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the Company received a request for documents from the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) that asks the Company to voluntarily produce certain documents to the FTC. The
document request, which does not allege wrongdoing, is part of an FTC non-public investigation to
determine whether the Company, in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, may
have engaged, or may be engaging, in anti-competitive practices with other wholesale pharmaceutical
distributors in order to limit competition for provider customers seeking distribution services.
The investigation is at an early stage, and the Company is in the process of responding to the FTC
document request.

In April 2005, we received a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General of the State of
New York (“NYAG”) requesting the production of documents, responses to interrogatories and other
information concerning our participation in the secondary or “alternate source” market for
pharmaceutical products. This investigation appears to be in its early stages; and we are
cooperating with the NYAG and intend to be fully responsive to the subpoena.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses, which were fully
divested by 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations. We have received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to
investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged
to exist at six sites where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations; and we,
by administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain actions at those sites, including
soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, we are one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United States Environmental
Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages (“NRD”) associated with
one of these six sites. Although the Company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot
be determined at this time, we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) group in the funding of an NRD assessment, the costs of which are reflected in the
aggregate estimates set forth below.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with outside
environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of reasonably possible remediation
costs for these six sites is $11.5 million, net of approximately $2 million that third parties have
agreed to pay in settlement or we expect, based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions
which are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties. The $11.5 million is expected to be paid
out between April 2005 and March of 2028. Our estimated liability for these environmental matters
has been accrued in the accompanying balance sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law or its state law
equivalent) for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of
hazardous substances at 28 sites. With respect to each of these sites, numerous other PRPs have
similarly been designated and, while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and
several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with
other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 28 sites is approximately $2 million. The aggregate
settlements and costs paid by us in Superfund matters to date have not been significant. The
accompanying consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors
as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs; the complexity and evolving
nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs
and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs are recoverable from
insurance or other parties.

While it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome or the duration of
any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this section II, “Other
Litigation and Claims”, we believe based on current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that,
except as otherwise noted, such litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

III. Contingency

In 2002, we entered into a $500 million, ten year contract with the National Health Services
Information Authority (“NHS”), an organization of the British government charged with the
responsibility of delivering healthcare in England and Wales. The contract engages the Company to
develop, implement and operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 NHS locations.

As previously reported, there have been contract delays to date which have increased costs and
decreased the amount of time in which we can earn revenues. These delays have adversely impacted
the contract’s projected profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this
contract. As of March 31, 2005, our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of
approximately $114 million in net assets, consisting of prepaid expenses, software and capital
assets, net of cash received, related to this contract. Due to the delays and other desired
modifications to the original contract, we have negotiated a tentative agreement with the NHS on
changes to certain key terms and conditions in the contract including a term extension and updated
implementation plan. We expect this contract amendment to be signed in the first quarter of the
2006 fiscal year. While we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate a satisfactory
system and recover our investment in this contract, failure to sign the tentative agreement in its
current form and/ or further implementation delays may result in significant losses that could be
material. Additionally, if there is further modification to the tentative amended contract terms
and



McKESSON CORPORATION

conditions and implementation plan, it is possible that the terms of that agreement may result
in significant losses, that could be material.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through the solicitation of proxies
or otherwise, during the three months ended March 31, 2005.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related
Stockholder Matters

Information about security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management is
incorporated by reference from the Proxy Statement.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have been approved by the Company’s
stockholders. The plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
except for the Directors’ Plan (defined below) which is administered by the Committee on Directors
and Corporate Governance.

1994 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “1994 Plan”)

: The 1994 Plan was adopted by
the Board of Directors in 1994 and provided for the grant of approximately 41.2 million shares,
which includes awards granted under predecessor plans, in the form of nonqualified stock options,
incentive stock options with or without tandem stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted
stock, or restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Options granted under the 1994 Plan were generally
subject to the same terms and conditions as those granted under the 1999 Plan, discussed below,
except that under the 1994 Plan only executive officers of the Company were eligible to receive
option grants. The 1994 Plan expired in October 2004 and thus we no longer grant any awards under
this plan.

1997 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan (the “Directors’ Plan”)

:
The Directors’ Plan was adopted in 1997 and provides for the grant of approximately 1.3 million
shares in the form of nonqualified stock options or restricted stock units to non-employee
directors of the Company. Shares subject to option grants, which cease to be exercisable, shall
not be counted against the number of shares available under the Directors’ Plan. RSUs (described
below), whether or not distributed in the form of restricted stock, will be counted against the
number of shares available.

Under the Director’s Plan, each director receives an annual stock option grant of 7,500
shares. In addition, each director is required to defer 50% of his or her annual retainer into
either RSUs payable in cash or stock at the Director’s election, or nonqualified stock options, and
may also elect to defer the remaining 50% of the annual retainer into RSUs or Retainer Options or
the Company’s Deferred Compensation Administration Plan (DCAP II), or may elect to receive cash.
Meeting fees and Committee Chair annual retainers may be deferred into RSUs or DCAP II or may be
paid in cash. Options are granted at fair market value and have a term of ten years. If the
Company’s stockholders approve the new 2005 Stock Incentive Plan at the Annual Meeting on July 27,
2005, as described in the Company’s Proxy Statement, this Plan will be replaced by the 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan.

1973 Stock Purchase Plan (the “SPP”):

The SPP was adopted by the stockholders of the
Company’s predecessor in 1973. The Company’s stockholders approved an additional 2.5 million
shares to be issued under the SPP in 1999, which remain available for issuance. Rights to purchase
shares are granted under the SPP to key employees of the Company as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board. The purchase price, to be paid in cash or using promissory notes of the
Company common stock subject to rights granted under the SPP, is the fair market value of such
stock on the date the right is exercised.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”):

The ESPP is intended to qualify as an
“employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. In
March 2002, the Board amended the ESPP to allow for participation in the plan by employees of
certain of the Company’s international and other subsidiaries. As to those employees, the ESPP
does not so qualify

.

Currently, 11.1 million shares have been authorized for issuance under the
ESPP.

The ESPP was implemented through a continuous series of 24-month offerings beginning on the
first trading day on or after each May 1 and November 1 (the “Offering Dates”) and ending on the
last trading day of the month which is 24 months later (the “Offering Periods”) and six-month
periods beginning on each May 1 and November 1 and ending on the following October 31 and April 30,
during which contributions could be made toward the purchase of common stock under the plan
(“Purchase Periods”). Effective April 1, 2005, the ESPP has been amended to eliminate the 24-month
lookback feature, and following a one-time four-month Purchase Period, effective August 1, 2005,
Purchase Periods will occur every three months.



McKESSON CORPORATION

Each eligible employee may elect to authorize regular payroll deductions during the next
succeeding Purchase Period, the amount of which may not exceed 15% of a participant’s compensation.
At the end of each Purchase Period, the funds withheld by each participant will be used to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of each share of the Company’s
common stock was the lesser of (i) 85% of the fair market value of such share on the first day of
the Offering Period; or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of such share on the last day of the
applicable Purchase Period. Effective April 1, 2005, the purchase price of each share of the
Company’s common stock will be based on 85% of the fair market value of each share on the last day
of the applicable Purchase Period. In general, the maximum number of shares of common stock that
may be purchased by a participant for each Purchase Period is determined by dividing $12,500 by the
fair market value of one share of common stock on the Offering Date.

The following are descriptions of equity plans that have not been submitted for approval by
the Company’s stockholders:

1999 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “1999 Plan

”): The 1999 Plan was adopted by
the Board of Directors in 1999. The Plan provides for the grant to eligible employees of 45.2
million shares in the form of nonqualified stock options, with or without SARs, restricted stock or
restricted stock units. No executive officers or directors participate in this Plan. If the
Company’s stockholders approve the new 2005 Stock Incentive Plan at the Annual Meeting on July 27,
2005, this 1999 Plan will be replaced by the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.

Options are granted at not less than fair market value and have a term of ten years. Options
generally become exercisable in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant
date, or after four years from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted under the 1999 Plan
contains certain restrictions on transferability and may not be transferred until such restrictions
lapse (generally two to four years). Grantees may elect to use stock to satisfy any withholding
tax obligation upon the lapsing of restrictions on restricted stock awards.

1998 Canadian Stock Incentive Plan (the “Canadian Plan”):

The Canadian Plan was adopted by
the Board of Directors in January 1998, following the Company’s acquisition of a Canadian company,
to provide nonqualified stock options, with or without tandem SARs, to eligible employees of the
Canadian company. The Canadian Plan has subsequently been amended to allow for the grant of stock
options to employees of any of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries. A total of 0.9 million shares
have been authorized for issuance under the Canadian Plan. Options granted under the Canadian Plan
are generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those granted under the 1999 Plan,
discussed above, except that (i) options may be granted for less than the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and (ii) all options will become immediately
exercisable upon an employee’s disability or death and must be exercised within three years of such
date. If the Company’s shareholders approve the new stock incentive plan at the Annual Meeting on
July 27, 2005, this plan will be replaced by the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock Option Plans Adopted in January 1999 and August 1999

: On January 27, 1999 and August 25,
1999 the Board of Directors adopted certain stock option plans (the “January 1999 Plan” and the
“August 1999 Plan”, or together the “Plans”) to provide stock options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock to eligible employees of the Company pursuant to NYSE rules in effect at the
time the Plans were established. A maximum of 5.8 million and 5.2 million shares of common stock
were authorized for issuance under the January 1999 and August 1999 Plans. In each case the Plans
state that: (i) under each of the Plans no single officer or director of the Company or any
subsidiary could acquire more than 1% of the Company’s common stock outstanding at the time the
Plans were adopted, and (ii) each of the Plans, together with all stock option or purchase plans,
or any other arrangements pursuant to which officers or directors of the Company may acquire common
stock (other than stock plans for which stockholder approval is not required under Section 312.03
of the NYSE rules), does not authorize the issuance of more than 5% of the Company’s common stock
outstanding at the time the Plans were adopted (collectively the “NYSE Limits”). Options were
granted under each of the Plans to eligible employees of the Company. No further grants will be
made from either of the Plans.

Options granted under the Plans are generally subject to the same terms and conditions as
those granted under the 1994 Plan and 1999 Plan.

1999 Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999 SPP”):

The 1999 SPP was adopted by the Board of
Directors in February 1999. The 1999 SPP provided for the grant of rights to purchase a maximum of
0.7 million shares of common stock subject to the NYSE Limits. No further grants will be made from
the 1999 SPP. Rights to purchase shares were granted under the 1999 SPP to eligible employees of
the Company. The purchase price, to be paid in cash or using promissory notes, for the Company
common stock subject to rights granted under the 1999 SPP was



McKESSON CORPORATION

equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date the right was
exercised (which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE). Purchases were
evidenced by written stock purchase agreements which provide for the payment of the purchase price
by (i) payment in cash, or (ii) a promissory note payable on a repayment schedule determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).

HBOC 1994 UK Sharesave Scheme (the “1994 Scheme”):

In connection with the acquisition by the
Company of HBO & Company (“HBOC”), we assumed the HBOC 1994 Scheme, which is similar to the ESPP,
under which approximately 0.2 million shares remain available for issuance. Employees and previous
directors of HBOC and its subsidiaries, who are residents of the United Kingdom, are eligible to
receive options under the 1994 Scheme. The exercise price of the stock covered by each option
shall not be less than 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date the
option is granted. Participants under the 1994 Scheme pay for options through monthly
contributions, subject to minimum and maximum monthly limits. We no longer offer any new options
under the 1994 Scheme.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition

GENERAL

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition,
referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and
assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial
position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes.
The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all
references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

We conduct our business through three operating segments: Pharmaceutical Solutions,
Medical-Surgical Solutions and Provider Technologies. See Financial Note 1 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting Policies,” for a description of these
segments.

Revenues increased 16% to $80.5 billion in 2005 and 22% to $69.5 billion in 2004 primarily
reflecting growth in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment which is attributable to market growth
rates as well as new customers and expanded business with certain existing customers.

Gross profit increased 7% to $3.5 billion and 5% to $3.2 billion in 2005 and 2004. As a
percentage of revenues, gross profit declined 37 and 76 basis points in 2005 and 2004. Declines in
our gross profit margins primarily reflect declines in our sell margin due to a shift in customer
mix and competitive pressures. Additionally, declines in our gross profit margin in 2004 were also
due to a higher proportion of our revenue derived from our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which
has lower margins relative to our other segments. The Pharmaceutical Solutions segment’s gross
profit margin was impacted by declines in our sell margin due to the competitive environment in
which we operate, as well as pressure on its buy side margin and, for 2004, by a higher proportion
of sales to customers’ warehouses which have lower margins. In addition, gross profit was impacted
by a number of significant items, which are discussed in further detail, including a $51.0 million
provision for expected losses on five multi-year contracts in our Provider Technologies segment’s
international business in 2003.

Operating expenses were $3.7 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Operating expenses for 2005 include a $1.2 billion pre-tax charge relating to our Securities
Litigation as disclosed on page 33 of this Financial Review. As a percentage of revenues,
operating expenses were 4.54% (3.05% without the Securities Litigation charge), 3.26% and 3.80% in
2005, 2004 and 2003. Excluding the Securities Litigation charge, operating expenses as a
percentage of revenues have declined over the last two years, mainly due to leveraging of our fixed
cost infrastructure and productivity improvements in back-office and field operations, as well as
in 2004, due to a higher proportion of sales to customers’ warehouses which have lower operating
expense margins. Increases in operating expense dollars were primarily due to the Securities
Litigation charge as well as additional expenses incurred to support our sales volume growth.
Operating expenses were also impacted by a number of significant items which are discussed in
further detail, including a $66.4 million credit pertaining to the reversal of a portion of
customer settlement reserves within our Provider Technologies segment in 2004.

Income (loss) before income taxes was ($239.8) million, $911.4 million and $851.4 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, reflecting the above noted factors. On an operating segment basis, results
for 2005 primarily reflect revenue growth and a decline in gross profit margins in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment as well as a decrease in the Provider Technologies segment
operating profit. Results for 2004 reflect revenue growth and a decrease in gross

profit margins in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, and improved operating profit in our Medical-Surgical
Solutions and Provider Technologies segments.

Net income (loss) was ($156.7) million, $646.5 million and $555.4 million in 2005, 2004 and
2003. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was ($0.53), $2.19 and $1.88 in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Excluding the Securities Litigation charge, net income and net income per diluted share for 2005
would have been $653.3 million and $2.19. In addition to those factors discussed above, net income
(loss) reflects an increase in our reported income tax rate to 35% in 2005 and a decrease in our
reported income tax rate to 29% in 2004. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates primarily
reflect changes within state and foreign income tax rates resulting from the Company’s business mix
as well as favorable tax settlements and adjustments.

Revenues increased 16% in 2005 and 22% in 2004. The growth in revenues was primarily driven
by the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, which accounted for more than 90% of revenues. Revenues
were not materially impacted by business acquisitions.

Increases in U.S. Healthcare pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2005,
excluding sales to customers’ warehouses, primarily reflect market growth rates, new institutional
customers as well as growth from existing institutional customers, which includes mail-order
businesses. In the first quarter of 2005, we implemented a new pharmaceutical distribution
contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which significantly contributed to the segment’s
total increase in revenues. Increases in these revenues for 2004 also reflect market growth rates
as well as new independent pharmacy, mail order and institutional customers in our pharmaceutical
distribution business. Market growth rates reflect growing drug utilization and price increases,
which are offset in part by the increased use of lower priced generics.

U.S. Healthcare sales to customers’ warehouses increased primarily as a result of greater
volume to, and expanded agreements with, existing customers. Sales to customers’ warehouses
include the AdvancePCS business acquired by our customer, Caremark, which began in the second
quarter of 2005. Sales to customers’ warehouses represent



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self-warehousing customers whereby we order and subsequently
deliver bulk products from the manufacturer to the customers’ warehouses through a central
distribution facility. These sales provide a benefit to our customers in that they can use one
source for both their direct store-to-store business and their warehouse business.

Canadian pharmaceutical distribution revenues increased reflecting market growth rates,
favorable exchange rates and new business from manufacturers which formerly engaged in direct
distribution activities. On a constant currency basis, revenues from our Canadian operations would
have increased approximately 10% in 2005 compared to 2004.

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distribution revenues increased slightly in 2005 as growth
in revenues in the alternative site sector exceeded a decline in revenues in the acute care sector.
Increases in our alternate site sector include revenues of Moore Medical Corporation (“MMC”),
which we acquired in the first quarter of 2005. MMC is an Internet-enabled, multi-channel marketer
and distributor of medical-surgical and pharmaceutical products to non-hospital provider settings.
Revenues for 2004 decreased nominally as increases in our primary and alternate site sectors were
more than fully offset by a decline in revenues in the acute care sector. Declines in our acute
care sector reflect the loss of the segment’s largest customer in the third quarter of 2004.

Provider Technologies segment revenues increased in 2005 reflecting greater demand for our
clinical applications and imaging technology offerings as well as growth in automation product
installations. Revenues for 2004 decreased reflecting growth in software services and hardware
which were fully offset by decreases in sales of non-clinical solutions, longer installation
periods required for certain large complex clinical implementations and contracting changes in the
segment’s automation business both of which had the effect of delaying revenue recognition.

Gross profit increased by 7% in 2005 and 5% in 2004. As a percentage of revenues, gross
profit decreased 37 and 76 basis points in 2005 and 2004. Gross profit margin decreased primarily
reflecting a decline in the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment margin. Additionally, declines in our
gross profit margin were due to a higher proportion of revenues attributable to our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment, which has lower margins relative to our other segments in 2004. Gross profit
was also impacted by a $51.0 million provision for expected contract losses in 2003 within our
Provider Technologies segment.

In 2005, gross profit margin for our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment was impacted by:

–

a lower number of and average magnitude of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals in the current year compared to
2004,

–

pressure on other buy side margins as the industry continues to evolve. Certain types of vendor product incentives and
sources of supply, such as certain inventory purchases in the secondary market, are not available at historical levels
to the major distributors, which has the impact of reducing gross margins,

–

lower selling margins within our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business which reflect a higher proportion of
revenues attributable to institutional customers, and continued competitive pressures which moderated



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The decrease in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment gross profit margin in 2004 primarily reflects:

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of
its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than do
other accounting methods, thereby mitigating the effects of inflation and deflation on operating
profit. The practice in the Pharmaceutical Solutions distribution businesses is to pass on to
customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

provide us with price protection, which prevents inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical
products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other
product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those fiscal years.

Over the past two years, gross profit margin increased in our Medical-Surgical Solutions
segment primarily due to a higher proportion of revenues being derived from our alternative site
sector, which includes MMC, which has higher margins relative to the segment’s other sectors.

Gross profit margin decreased in 2005 and increased in 2004 in our Provider Technologies
segment. Excluding a $51.0 million provision for expected losses on certain of the segment’s
international contracts in 2003, gross profit margin for 2004 approximated that of 2003. The decrease in the segment’s gross profit margin
in 2005 primarily reflects a greater mix of revenue associated with clinical products which,
because of their complexity, have a higher cost of installation and support than other more
established products.

In addition, in 2003, our Provider Technologies segment recorded a $51.0 million provision for
expected losses on five multi-year contracts in the segment’s international business.
Substantially all of these expected losses pertain to contracts that were entered into in 2001 or
earlier. These contracts contained multiple-element deliverables, including customization of
software. In addition, these contracts place significant reliance on third party vendors, as well
as the customers. During the software development and implementation phases of these contracts,
despite experiencing certain operational issues, we believed these contracts could be fully
performed on a timely basis and remain profitable. In 2003, after experiencing numerous delays in
product delivery and functionality, we conducted a reassessment of the contract delivery and
project methodology, including assessment of our third party vendors’ ability to perform under
these contracts. We determined that certain contract obligations, including software
functionality, could not be met within existing contract cost estimates and delivery dates.
Accordingly, in 2003, we reassessed our estimate of the costs to fulfill our contract obligations
and recorded a $51.0 million provision for the expected contract losses.

Operating expenses for 2005 include a $1.2 billion charge pertaining to our Securities Litigation.
Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased 128 basis points (or decreased 21 basis
points excluding the Securities Litigation charge) in 2005 and decreased 54 basis points in 2004.
Excluding the items noted below, increases in operating expenses were primarily due to additional
expenses incurred to support our sales volume growth, including distribution expenses, higher
foreign currency exchange rates for our Canadian operations, and for 2005, expenses from the MMC
business which was acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year. Partially offsetting these
increases was a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improved management of accounts
receivable. Excluding the Securities Litigation charge, decreases in operating expenses as a
percentage of revenue were primarily due to the leveraging of our fixed cost infrastructure and
productivity improvements in back-office and field operations within our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment. In addition, for 2004, the decrease was also attributable to a higher proportion of sales
to customers’ warehouses, which have lower operating expense margins.

Segment operating profit includes gross margin, net of operating expenses, other income and
gain (loss) on investments for our three business segments. In addition to the significant items
previously discussed, increases in operating profit reflect revenue growth and increased operating
profit in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, partially offset by lower operating profit in our
Medical-Surgical Solutions and Provider Technologies segments for 2005. Increases in operating
profit in 2004 reflect revenue growth and increased operating profit in our Pharmaceutical
Solutions segment, combined with improved operating profits in our Medical-Surgical Solutions and
Provider Technologies segments.

Operating profit, as a percentage of revenues, over the last two years decreased in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. This decrease primarily reflects a net decline in gross margins,
offset in part with cost reductions by leveraging the segment’s fixed cost infrastructure and
productivity improvements in back-office and field operations. In addition, in 2004, operating
profit included a $30.0 million bad debt provision for a customer bankruptcy and a decrease in
gains on sales of venture investments, offset in part by lower restructuring charges.

Medical-Surgical Solutions segment’s operating profit as a percentage of revenues declined in
2005 primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margins which were more than offset by a
higher proportion of operating expenses. Operating expenses increased, in both dollars and as a
percentage of revenues, primarily due to the acquisition of MMC, and a higher proportion of costs
incurred to serve the segment’s alternative site customers, which have a higher cost-to-serve ratio
than the segment’s other customers. Operating profit for 2005 was also impacted by the lack of flu
vaccine supply as well as a $7.4 million charge to operating expenses due to an increase in
litigation reserves. Operating profit as a percentage of revenues increased in 2004 for this
segment primarily reflecting improvements in gross profit and a reduction in operating expenses.
The reduction in 2004 operating expenses reflects the removal of duplicate operating expenses as a
result of the segment’s 2002/2003 distribution center network consolidation plan, as well as other
operational improvements including a significant decrease in bad debt expense. In 2003, operating
profit benefited from $12.0 million in reversals of the prior year’s accrued restructuring charges
as a result of a modification to the segment’s distribution center network consolidation plan.
This benefit was partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of approximately $11 million.

Provider Technologies segment’s operating profit as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2005
and increased in 2004. Operating profit for 2005 reflects a decrease in gross profit margin as
well as an increase in operating expenses to support the segment’s revenue growth and a decrease in
customer settlement reserve reversals. Increases in operating profit as a percentage of revenues
for 2004 reflects a higher gross profit margin, $66.4 million of reversals of customer settlement
reserves due to favorable settlements and negotiations (or $44.1 million more than 2003), and
better control of expenses. Operating profit for 2003 reflects a $51.0 million provision for
expected losses on five multi-year contracts within the segment’s international business and a
$22.3 million credit for the reversal of a portion of customer settlement reserves.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Corporate expenses, net of other income, increased over the last two years. Expenses for 2005
reflect $25.1 million of incremental legal costs due to accelerating activity in our Securities
Litigation, approximately $10 million of the previously discussed settlement charges pertaining to
a non-qualified pension plan and additional administrative expenses to support various initiatives.
In 2005, we made several lump sum cash payments totaling approximately $42 million from an
unfunded U.S. pension plan. In accordance with accounting standards, additional charges for
settlements associated with lump sum payments of pension obligations were expensed in the period in
which the payments were made. Corporate expenses, net of other income, were partially offset by
higher interest income earned. Expenses for 2004 reflect a $21.0 million charge for uncollected
balances on loans made to former employees for the purchase of McKesson common stock primarily in
February 1999, $13.8 million incremental legal costs associated with our Securities Litigation,
higher pension expense, and severance costs associated with the restructuring of our
enterprise-wide information network support departments. Partially offsetting these increases was
approximately $13 million of gains on the sales of surplus properties.

Securities Litigation Charge:

As discussed in Financial Note 19, numerous legal proceedings
arose out of our April 28, 1999 announcement regarding accounting improprieties at HBOC, now known
as McKesson Information Solutions LLC (the “Securities Litigation”). In 2005, we recorded a
pre-tax charge totaling $1.2 billion ($810.0 million after-tax) for the Securities Litigation
charge. The charge consists of $960.0 million for the Consolidated Action and $240.0 million for
other Securities Litigation proceedings, as discussed in the following two paragraphs.

On January 12, 2005, we announced that we had reached an agreement to settle the action
captioned

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation

(N.D. Cal. Case No. C-99-20743-RMW) (the
“Consolidated Action”). In general, under the agreement to settle the Consolidated Action, we will
pay the settlement class a total of $960.0 million in cash. Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees will be
deducted from the settlement amount prior to payments to class members. The parties have agreed on
the terms of a stipulation of settlement and are finalizing the exhibits to the stipulation before
submitting it to the Court. The settlement agreement is subject to various conditions, including,
but not limited to, preliminary approval by the Court, notice to the Class, and final approval by
the Court after a hearing.

During the third quarter of 2005, we also established a reserve of $240.0 million, which the
Company believes will be adequate to address its remaining potential exposure with respect to other
previously reported Securities Litigation. However, in view of the number of remaining cases, the
uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial amounts
involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be below the
reserve.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense decreased nominally in 2005 as the benefit of lower
average borrowings was almost fully offset by increases in our effective interest rate. Interest
expense decreased in 2004 primarily due to lower average borrowings, including the repayment of
$125.0 million of 6.55% notes in November 2002.

Income Taxes:

The Company’s reported tax rate was 34.7%, 29.1% and 34.0% in 2005, 2004 and
2003. In addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in the reported tax rate are primarily
due to changes within state and foreign tax rates resulting from the Company’s business mix,
including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income
tax rates.

In 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of $390.0 million for the Securities Litigation.
We believe the proposed settlement of the consolidated securities class action and the ultimate
resolution of the lawsuits brought independently by other shareholders will be tax deductible.
However, the tax attributes of the litigation are complex and the Company expects challenges from
the taxing authorities, and accordingly such deductions will not be finalized until all
the lawsuits are concluded and an examination of the Company’s tax returns is completed.
Accordingly, we have provided a reserve of $85.0 million for future resolution of these uncertain
tax matters. While we believe the tax reserve is adequate, the ultimate resolution of these tax
matters may exceed or be below the reserve.

In 2005, we recorded a $9.6 million income tax benefit arising primarily from settlements and
adjustments with various taxing authorities and a $2.8 million income tax benefit primarily due to
a reduction of a valuation allowance related to state income tax net operating loss carryforwards.
We believe that the income tax benefit from a portion of these state net operating loss
carryforwards will now be realized.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In 2004, our reported tax rate benefited from various state tax initiatives. We recorded a
$23.2 million tax benefit relating to favorable tax settlements and adjustments with the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service and with various taxing authorities. A large portion of this benefit,
which was not previously recognized by the Company, resulted from the filing of amended tax returns by our subsidiary, McKesson Information
Solutions LLC (formerly known as HBO & Company) for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.

Net Income:

Net income (loss) was ($156.7) million, $646.5 million and $555.4 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was ($0.53), $2.19 and $1.88 in 2005, 2004
and 2003. Excluding the Securities Litigation charge, 2005 net income and net income per diluted
share would have been $653.3 million and $2.19.

A reconciliation between our net loss per share reported for U.S. GAAP purposes and our
earnings per diluted share, excluding the charge for the Securities Litigation for 2005 is as

Discontinued Operations:

Net loss from discontinued operations was $6.7 million ($0.02
per diluted share) in 2003. Results from discontinued operations include those of a marketing
fulfillment business, which we sold in 2003, as well as adjustments made in 2003 relating to the

.

Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding:

Diluted earnings (loss) per share were
calculated based on an average number of shares outstanding of 293.5 million, 298.6 million and
298.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003. For 2005, potentially dilutive securities were excluded
from the per share computations due to their antidilutive effect.

International Operations

International operations accounted for 6.7%, 6.7% and 6.3% of 2005, 2004 and 2003 of
consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency
fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic
and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information
regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Notes 4 and 22, “Contracts”

In 2005 and 2004, net charges for restructuring activities, excluding customer settlement
reserve reversals, amounted to $0.5 million and $3.8 million. These charges related to a number of
smaller initiatives offset in part by adjustments to prior years’ restructuring reserves.

In 2003, net credits for restructuring activities, excluding customer settlement reserve
reversals, amounted to $4.8 million. These net credits primarily related to $12.0 million of
reversals of severance and exit-related accruals pertaining to our re-evaluation of our 2002
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distribution center network consolidation plan. The original
consolidation plan included a net reduction of 20 distribution centers, from 51, compared to a net
reduction of 14 under the revised plan. Net credits for 2003 also include $5.1 million of charges
for additional facility closure costs associated with prior years’ restructuring plans in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.

In addition to the above restructuring activities, we are still managing a 2001/2000
restructuring plan associated with customer settlements for the discontinuance of overlapping and
nonstrategic products and other product development projects within our Provider Technologies
segment. Customer settlement reserves were established, reviewed and assessed on a customer and
contract specific basis, and actual settlements for each customer varied significantly depending on
the specific mix and number of products, and each customer contract or contracts. In 2005, 2004
and 2003, we reversed $4.0 million, $66.4 million and $22.3 million of accrued customer settlement
reserves into operating expenses due to favorable settlements and negotiations with affected
customers. There have been no significant offsetting changes in estimates that increase the
provision for customer settlements. Total cash and non-cash settlements of $45.3 million and $95.6
million have been incurred since the inception of this restructuring plan. Non-cash settlements
represent write-offs of customer receivables. As of March 31, 2005, accrued customer settlement
reserves were $1.6 million and we do not anticipate any significant adjustments to the reserve.

consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our restructuring activities.

Acquisitions and
Investments

We
made the following acquisitions and investments:

-

In 2005, we invested $32.7 million in return for a 79.7% interest
in Pahema, S.A. de C.V. (“Pahema”), a Mexican holding company.
Two additional investors, owners of approximately 30% of the
outstanding shares of Nadro S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”) (collectively,
“investors”), contributed $9.6 million for the remaining interest
in Pahema. In December 2004, Pahema completed a 6.50 Mexican
Pesos per share, or approximately $164 million, tender offer for
approximately 284 million shares (or approximately 46%) of the
outstanding publicly held shares of common stock of Nadro. Pahema
financed the tender offer utilizing the cash contributed by us and
the investors, and borrowings totaling 1.375 billion Mexican
Pesos, in the form of two notes with Mexican financial
institutions. Subsequently, the common stock of Pahema was
exchanged for common stock of Nadro, resulting in the merger of
the two companies. As a result, we currently own approximately
49% of Nadro. Prior to the tender offer, we owned approximately
22% of the outstanding common shares of Nadro. We continue to
utilize the equity method in accounting for our investment in
Nadro.

-

In the first quarter of 2005, we acquired all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Moore Medical Corp. (“MMC”), of New Britain,
Connecticut, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately
$37 million. MMC is an Internet-enabled, multi-channel marketer
and distributor of medical-surgical and pharmaceutical products to
non-hospital provider settings. Approximately $19 million of the
purchase price has been assigned to goodwill, none of which is
deductible for tax purposes. The results of MMC’s operations have
been included in the consolidated financial statements within our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment since the acquisition date.

-

In 2003, we acquired the outstanding stock of A.L.I. Technologies
Inc. (“A.L.I.”) for an aggregate cash purchase price of $347.0
million. A.L.I. provides digital medical imaging solutions, which
are designed to streamline access to diagnostic information,
automate clinical workflow and eliminate the need for film
purchase and storage. The acquisition of A.L.I. complemented our
Horizon Clinicals™ offering by incorporating medical images into a
computerized patient record. Approximately $328 million of
A.L.I.’s purchase price was assigned to goodwill, none of which is
deductible for tax purposes. The aggregate purchase price was
financed through cash and short-term borrowings. The results of
A.L.I.’s operations have been included in the consolidated
financial statements within our Provider Technologies segment
since its acquisition date.

-

In 2003, we purchased the remaining interest in an investment of
our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment for approximately $32
million, retained a small portion of the business and subsequently
sold the balance for approximately $40 million, the proceeds of
which consisted of an interest bearing ten-year note receivable,
resulting in a nominal loss.

During the last three years we also completed several smaller acquisitions and investments
within all three of our operating segments. Purchase prices have been allocated based on estimated
fair values at the date of acquisition and may be subject to change. Pro forma results of
operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the effects were not
material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or aggregate basis.

2006 Outlook

Information regarding the Company’s 2006 outlook, including business risks and opportunities,
is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 5, 2005. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with
the sections “Factors Affecting Forward-looking Statements” and “Additional Factors That May Affect
Future Results” included in this Financial Review.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make
assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if
different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the
accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a
material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates
that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition.
Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to
our consolidated financial statements. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates,
actual results may differ from these estimates.

Valuation of Receivables:

We provide short-term credit and other customer financing
arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing relates
to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of
inventories, and lease and credit financing. We estimate the receivables for which we do not
expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the
current creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance is recorded in our consolidated financial
statements for these amounts

.

If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition
or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require
adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer
financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. At March 31, 2005,
trade and notes receivables were $5,492.2 million, and other customer financing was $189.8 million,
prior to allowances of $159.5 million.

In addition, at March 31, 2005, we had $44.9 million of notes receivable from certain of our
current and former officers and senior managers related to purchases of common stock under our
various employee stock purchase plans. These notes were issued for amounts equal to the market
value of the stock on the date of the purchase, are full recourse to the borrower and were due at
various dates through February 2004. As of March 31, 2005, the value of the underlying stock
collateral was $23.8 million. We evaluate the collectability of these notes on an ongoing basis.
As a result, in 2004, we recorded a $21.0 million charge for notes due from former employees whose
uncollected balances relate to the purchase of the Company’s common stock primarily in February
1999. In 2005, we reversed approximately $6 million of this reserve based on an increase in price
of the underlying stock collateral. There can be no assurance that we will recover the full
amounts due under any of the notes and we continue to assess their collectability.

Valuation of Inventories:

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. Inventories
for our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments consist of merchandise
held for resale. For our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic
inventories was determined on the LIFO method and international inventories are stated using the
first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost of inventories for our Medical-Surgical Solutions
segment was primarily determined on the FIFO method. Provider Technologies segment’s inventories
consist of computer hardware with cost determined either by the specific identification or the FIFO
method. Total inventories were $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion at March 31, 2005 and 2004. In
determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including
estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase
obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer
preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products, or the loss of
one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories.

Valuation of Goodwill:

We have significant goodwill assets as a result of acquiring
businesses. We account for goodwill under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires us to maintain goodwill assets on our
books unless the assets are deemed to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill
balances annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Such impairment tests require that we
first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the
operations in which goodwill is assigned. If carrying value exceeds fair value, a second step
would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment. Fair values can be determined using
income, market or cost approaches.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We predominately use a discounted cash flow model derived from internal budgets in assessing
fair values for our goodwill impairment testing. Factors that could change the result of our
goodwill impairment test include, but are not limited to, different assumptions used to forecast
future revenues, expenses, capital expenditures and working capital requirements used in our cash
flow models. In addition, selection of a risk-adjusted discount rate on the estimated undiscounted
cash flows is susceptible to future changes in market conditions, and when unfavorable, can
adversely affect our original estimates of fair values. At March 31, 2005, we concluded that there
was no impairment in our goodwill.

Contract Accounting:

We use the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize
certain revenues and costs, primarily for long-term software contracts within our Provider
Technologies segment. This method of accounting requires us to estimate the timing and amounts of
total revenue to be earned and total costs to be incurred over the life of a contract. Revenue
estimates are derived primarily from negotiated contract prices modified by assumptions regarding
change orders, contract arrangements and assumptions regarding penalty provisions associated with
technical performance. Revenues are recorded based on the percentage of costs incurred to date
compared to the most recent estimate of total costs to complete each contract. Cost estimates are
based primarily on the expected amount of resources required to complete the contract.

The estimated revenue to be earned and costs to complete a project can change significantly
throughout the period of a contract. Factors that could change estimates include, but are not
limited to, the ability to successfully complete milestones, the timing of milestones, and
modifications in the amount of resources or other costs required to complete the project. Changes
in estimates to complete, and revisions in overall profit estimates on percentage of completion
contracts, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract
losses if and when the current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.
Such a provision is subject to change as additional information is obtained and as contracts
progress towards completion.

In 2002, we entered into a $500 million, ten year contract with the National Health Services
Information Authority (“NHS”), an organization of the British government charged with the
responsibility of delivering healthcare in England and Wales. The contract engages the Company to
develop, implement and operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 NHS locations.

As previously reported, there have been contract delays to date which have increased costs and
decreased the amount of time in which we can earn revenues. These delays have adversely impacted
the contract’s projected profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this
contract. As of March 31, 2005, our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of
approximately $114 million in net assets, consisting of prepaid expenses, software and capital
assets, net of cash received, related to this contract. Due to the delays and other desired
modifications to the original contract, we have negotiated a tentative agreement with the NHS on
changes to certain key terms and conditions in the contract including a term extension and updated
implementation plan. We expect this contract amendment to be signed in the first quarter of the
2006 fiscal year. While we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate a satisfactory
system and recover our investment in this contract, failure to sign the tentative agreement in its
current form and/ or further implementation delays may result in significant losses that could be
material. Additionally, if there is further modification to the tentative amended contract terms
and conditions and implementation plan, it is possible that the terms of that agreement may result
in significant losses, that could be material.

Stock Options:

We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” In accordance
with APB No. 25, compensation expense is recorded based on a stock option’s intrinsic value, which
is the difference between the market value of a company’s stock and the exercise price at the date
of grant. As we generally grant stock options to employees at market value at the date of grant,
compensation expense as a result of option grants has been nominal.

Effective April 1, 2006, we anticipate recording stock-based compensation expense in
accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) requires the recognition
of cost resulting from all share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, in the
financial statements based on the grant-date fair values. We intend to adopt this standard using
the modified prospective method of transition, whereby compensation cost will be recognized for new
awards granted and awards modified, repurchased and cancelled after April 1, 2006 and for the
unvested portion of all awards issued prior to and outstanding at April 1, 2006 at their respective
grant date fair value as the remaining requisite service is rendered.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We have historically used the Black-Scholes option pricing model in determining the fair value
of the stock options for our stock-based compensation disclosures. Key assumptions for this option
pricing model include the expected term of the option, stock price volatility, risk-free interest
rate and dividend yield. Many of these assumptions are judgmental and highly sensitive in the
determination of the option’s fair value and hence the related compensation expense. The expected
term of the option represents the period of time that options are expected to remain outstanding
and is derived from historical data on option exercises. Expected volatility is based on
historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected
term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of
grant with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option. We calculate the expected
dividend yield using the historical annual dividend payments and the expected future stock price.
An increase in the expected term of the option, stock price volatility and/or risk-free interest
rate will increase compensation expense. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease
compensation expense.

Had we accounted for employee stock options based on fair value for all awards that vested
during the year, net loss and net loss per share for 2005 would have been $207.7 million and $0.71
compared to the reported net loss and net loss per share of $156.7 million and $0.53. Pro forma
amounts including stock-based compensation were impacted by certain stock option vesting period
accelerations and as a result, are not indicative of future estimated stock-based compensation
expense.

Historically, options granted by the Company generally vest over four years and have a term of
seven or ten years. However, for employee retention purposes and in anticipation of the
requirements of SFAS No. 123(R), in 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of
Directors (the “Committee”) approved the accelerated vesting of substantially all unvested stock
options outstanding at that time. Furthermore in 2005, the Committee approved a shorter vesting
period for approximately 6 million stock options that were granted during the year. These 2005
options were fully vested by March 31, 2005. As SFAS No. 123(R) compensation expense is typically
amortized over the related vesting period, the stock options that received accelerated vesting in
2004 did not impact the pro forma expense in 2005. Offsetting this decrease, was the significant
pro forma expense associated with the 2005 stock options that received a shorter vesting period.

We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 123(R) on our consolidated financial
statements. As part of this assessment, we are evaluating modifications to our long-term
compensation program for key employees across the Company, which may limit stock option grants in
favor of restricted share grants and long-term, performance-based cash compensation. Nevertheless,
we do believe that this standard could have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Securities Litigation:

As discussed in Financial Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the third quarter of 2005,
we announced that we had reached an agreement to settle the action captioned

In re McKesson HBOC,
Inc. Securities Litigation

(N.D. Cal. Case No. C-99-20743-RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”). In
general, under the agreement to settle the Consolidated Action, we will pay the settlement class a
total of $960 million in cash. The settlement agreement is subject to various conditions,
including, but not limited to, preliminary approval by the Court, notice to the Class, and final
approval by the Court after a hearing. Other than the Consolidated Action, none of the previously
reported Securities Litigation has been resolved by the settlement described above. As a result,
during the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a pre-tax charge totaling $1.2 billion ($810.0
million after-tax) for the Securities Litigation charge, which consists of $960 million settlement
payment and $240 million reserve. In addition, for the litigation costs not covered under our
directors and officers’ liability insurance policies, we accrue costs when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We expensed $42.8 million,
$17.7 million and $3.9 million in 2005, 2003 and 2002 in connection with these matters.

We believe these recorded amounts will be adequate to address our remaining potential
exposures in relation with the Securities Litigation. However, in view of the number of remaining
cases, the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial
amounts involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be below
the reserve.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits:

Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs
and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts.
Our major assumptions for determining net pension and postretirement benefit costs include the
discount rate, long-term return on assets, and medical cost trends rates. We evaluate these
critical assumptions at least annually.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields on high quality fixed-income
investments. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and
increases pension expense. Long-term return on plan assets is determined based on the historical
experience of our portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly
traded equity and fixed-income indices, as well as target asset allocation. Our target asset
allocation is determined based on the risk tolerance characteristics of the plan and, at times, may
be adjusted to achieve our overall investment objective. Our medical trend assumptions are
developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely
long-term trend. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions
because of economic and other factors. The effects of actual results differing from our
assumptions are included in unamortized net gain and loss, which is amortized over future periods.

Sensitivity
to changes in the major assumptions for our U.S. pension and postretirement plans are
as follows:

Further information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans is provided in Financial
Note 15, “Pension Benefits,” and Note 16, “Other Postretirement Benefits”, to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes:

As discussed in Financial Note 17, “Income Taxes”, we recorded an income tax
benefit of $390 million relating to the Securities Litigation in the third quarter of 2005. We
believe the proposed settlement of the consolidated securities class action and the ultimate
resolution of the lawsuits brought independently by other shareholders will be tax deductible.
However, the tax attributes of the litigation are complex and the Company expects challenges from
the taxing authorities, and accordingly such deductions will not be finalized until all
the lawsuits are concluded and an examination of the Company’s tax returns is completed.
Accordingly, we have provided a reserve of $85 million for future resolution of these uncertain tax
matters. While we believe the tax reserve is adequate, the ultimate resolution of these tax
matters may exceed or be below the reserve.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in determining the estimated worldwide provision for income taxes. During the
ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on
estimates of whether additional amounts will be due. As of March 31, 2005, approximately $242
million has been accrued for such matters. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact
the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”) was signed into law.
The AJCA provides a new deduction for certain qualified domestic production activities. As
discussed in Financial Note 1, “New Accounting Pronouncements”, to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, we are currently evaluating whether a tax deduction on qualified production
activities provided by the AJCA may be available to us and the impact of FSP No. FAS 109-1,
“Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” on our
consolidated financial statements. We will recognize the tax benefit of such deductions, if any,
beginning in 2006.

In addition, the AJCA provides a one-time 85% dividends received deduction for certain foreign
earnings that are repatriated under a plan for reinvestment in the United States, provided certain
criteria are met. We are also evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision and the impact
of FSP No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation
Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” on our consolidated financial statements.
We expect to complete this evaluation before the end of 2006. The range of possible amounts of unremitted earnings that is being considered for
repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million. The related potential range of
income tax is between zero and $27.7 million.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash flow from operating activities was $1,538.4 million in 2005, compared with $595.2
million in 2004 and $773.4 million in 2003. Net cash flow from operating activities in 2005
includes an $810.0 million non-cash after-tax charge for the Securities Litigation. We anticipate
paying this liability commencing in mid-2006. Net cash flow from operating activities improved in
2005 reflecting greater earnings, excluding the Securities Litigation charge, as well as the
evolving nature of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business. Notably, purchases from certain
of our suppliers are better aligned with customer demand and as a result, net financial inventory
(inventory net of accounts payable) has decreased. In addition, working capital levels benefited
from favorable receivable terms on our new contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs and
improved accounts receivable management. Partially offsetting this working capital decrease is
increased working capital associated with revenue growth, including our new contract with the
Department of Veterans Affairs. Included in our 2005 net cash flow from operating activities is
$40.0 million of cash provided to a customer in exchange for a note receivable as well as a
cancellation of a credit facility guarantee and other guarantee in favor of this customer. 2004
and 2003 net cash flow from operations primarily reflects greater earnings, offset in part by net
increases in working capital required to support our revenue growth.

Net cash used in investing activities was $355.3 million in 2005, compared with $299.7 million
in 2004 and $664.0 million in 2003. The increased use of cash in 2005 includes $108.9 million of
business acquisition expenditures, primarily for the acquisition of MMC and the increased
investment in Nadro. Business acquisition expenditures in 2003 include $347.0 million paid for the
acquisition of A.L.I. Capitalized software expenditures decreased in 2005 compared to prior years
primarily due to the completion of certain technology related initiatives. This decrease was
partially offset by a higher level of property acquisitions which primarily reflect improvements to
our warehouse distribution and information technology networks.

Financing activities utilized cash of $91.1 million, $109.5 million and $145.2 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003. Financing activities for 2005 include repayment of $268.3 million of
long-term debt and an incremental $130.7 million from common stock issuances primarily resulting
from an increase in employees’ exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2004 include
$156.8 million of stock repurchases and the receipt of $32.8 million pertaining to the collection
of employee loans. 2003 financing activities include the repayment of $125.0 million of term debt
that had matured and $25.0 million of stock repurchases.

In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased 3.9 million and 0.9 million shares of our common stock for
$115.1 million and $25.0 million. In 2004, we effectively completed a $250.0 million repurchase
program initiated in 2001, which resulted in the repurchase of a total of 8.3 million shares of our
common stock. Also in 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new program to repurchase
up to $250.0 million of additional common stock of the Company. Under this new program, we
repurchased 1.4 million shares for $41.5 million in 2004. The Company made no stock repurchases in
2005. Stock repurchases may be made in open market or private transactions.

of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of
sales activity, new customer build-up requirements, the desired level of



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

investment inventory and the number and timing of new fee-based arrangements with
pharmaceutical manufacturers. Consolidated working capital has increased over the past two years
primarily as a result of our higher sales volume.

Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed declined over the past two years as a growth in
our operating profit was in excess of the growth in working capital and other investments needed to
fund the increase in revenue.

As previously discussed in this financial review, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion
($810.0 million after-tax) for the Securities Litigation charge in the third quarter of 2005. We
do not expect to have difficulties financing the settlement as payment becomes due later this
calendar year 2005 based on available information.

The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of $0.06 per share on its common
stock since the fourth quarter of 1999. Recently, a dividend of $0.06 per share was declared by
the Company’s Board of Directors on January 26, 2005, and was paid on April 1, 2005 to stockholders
of record at the close of business on March 1, 2005. The Company anticipates that it will continue
to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends
remain within the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon the Company’s
future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.

We define a purchase obligation as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is
enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory
purchases, capital commitments and service agreements.

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions (primarily for our
Canadian business) under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of inventory at a discount in the
event these customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial institutions.
Among other limitations, these inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also guaranteed
loans, credit facilities and the payment of leases for some customers; and we are a secured lender
for substantially all of these guarantees. Customer guarantees range from one to ten years and
were primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain strategic customers. At March 31,
2005, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer guarantees were
$179.5 million and $10.3 million. In 2005, we converted a $40.0 million credit facility guarantee
in favor of a customer to a note receivable due from this customer. This secured note bears
interest and is repayable in 2007. In conjunction with this modification, an inventory repurchase
guarantee in favor of this customer for approximately $12 million was also terminated in 2004. The
amount due under the note receivable from this customer was approximately $36 million at March 31,
2005. We consider it unlikely that we would make significant payments under these guarantees, and
accordingly, amounts accrued for these guarantees were nominal.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $84.9 million of standby letters of
credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet the security requirements for statutory
licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive
liability programs.

Credit Resources:

We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash, short-term borrowings and our
receivables sale facility. In September 2004, we entered into a $1.3 billion five-year, senior
unsecured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a
fixed base rate, or a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) rate or a
Eurodollar rate. Effective as of the closing date of the new credit facility agreement, we
terminated the commitments under a $550 million, three-year revolving credit facility that would
have expired in September 2005, and a $650 million, 364-day credit facility that would have expired
in September 2004. At March 31, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the current revolving
credit facility.

We also have a $1.4 billion revolving receivables sale facility, which was renewed in June
2004, the terms of which are substantially similar to those previously in place with the exception
that the facility was increased by $300.0 million. This facility expires in June 2005. At March
31, 2005, no amounts were outstanding or utilized under the receivables sale facility.

Our senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s are currently BBB, BBB and Baa3,
and our commercial paper ratings are currently A-2, F-2 and P-3. Our ratings outlook is stable
with all three agencies. Our various borrowing facilities and certain long-term debt instruments
are subject to covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio, which cannot
exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit
facility and $235.0 million of term debt could be accelerated. At March 31, 2005, this ratio was
18.7% and we were in compliance with all other covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings or the
lack of compliance with our covenants could result in a negative impact on our ability to finance
our operations through our credit facilities, as well as the issuance of additional debt at the
interest rates then currently available.

Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be
met by existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit sources and other
capital market transactions.

MARKET RISKS

Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term
borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our
variable rate debt were to have changed by 50 basis points in 2005, interest expense would not have
been materially different from that reported.

As of March 31, 2005, the aggregate fair value of our long-term debt was $1,334.5 million.
Fair value was estimated on the basis of quoted market prices, although trading in these debt
securities is limited and may not reflect fair value. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based
on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest
rates for debt securities with similar terms.

We derive revenues from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the Netherlands,
Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico. In addition, as discussed in Part I, “Business” of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently own an approximate 49% equity interest in a pharmaceutical
distributor in Mexico. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk on cash flows related to
sales, expenses, financing and investment transactions. If exchange rates on such currencies were
to fluctuate 10%, we believe that our results from operations and cash flows could be materially
affected. Aggregate foreign exchange translation gains and losses included in operations,
comprehensive income and stockholders’ equity are discussed in Financial Note 1 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, “Significant Accounting Policies.”

RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS

Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in “Critical
Accounting Policies” appearing within this Financial Review and Financial Note 21, “Related Party
Balances and Transactions,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

There are a number of new accounting pronouncements that may impact our financial results.
These new pronouncements are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, management’s discussion and analysis includes certain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”) and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”). Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by use of
forward-looking words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,”
“seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” or “estimates,” or the negative of these words, or
other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans or intentions
may also include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Although
it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but
are not limited to, the factors discussed under “Additional Factors That May Affect Future
Results.” The reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential
risks and uncertainties.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described herein or in our other public documents.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any
revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following additional factors may affect our future results:

Adverse resolution of pending Securities Litigation regarding the restatement of our historical
financial statements may cause us to incur material losses.

As discussed in Financial Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the third quarter of 2005, we announced that we
had reached an agreement to settle the action captioned

In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities
Litigation

(N.D. Cal. Case No. C-99-20743-RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”). In general, under the
agreement to settle the Consolidated Action, we will pay the settlement class a total of $960.0
million in cash. The settlement agreement is subject to various conditions, including, but not
limited to, preliminary approval by the Court, notice to the Class, and final approval by the Court
after a hearing. Other than the Consolidated Action, none of the previously reported Securities
Litigation has been resolved by the settlement described above. As a result, during the third
quarter of 2005, we recorded a pre-tax charge totaling $1.2 billion ($810.0 million after-tax) for
the Securities Litigation charge, which consists of $960.0 million settlement payment and $240.0
 million reserve. In addition, for the litigation costs not covered under our directors and
officers’ liability insurance policies, we accrue costs when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We recorded $42.8 million, $17.7 million
and $3.9 million of such expenses in 2005, 2004 and 2003.

We believe theses recorded amounts will be adequate to address our remaining potential
exposures in relation with the Securities Litigation. However, in view of the number of remaining
cases, the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial
amounts involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be below
the reserve.

Changes in the United States healthcare environment could have a material negative impact on our
revenues and net income.

Our products and services are primarily intended to function within the structure of the
healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the United States. In recent
years, the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. These
changes include increased use of managed care, cuts in



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, consolidation of pharmaceutical and
medical-surgical supply distributors, and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing
groups.

We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of
these changes, such as adverse changes in government funding of healthcare services, legislation or
regulations governing the privacy of patient information, or the delivery or pricing of
pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry
participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price
they are willing to pay for our products and services.

Changes in pharmaceutical and medical-surgical manufacturers’ pricing, selling, inventory,
distribution or supply policies or practices, or changes in our customer mix could also
significantly reduce our revenues and net income. Due to the diverse range of healthcare supply
management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes
may adversely impact us, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of
products and services.

There have been increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control or limit the
product availability in the supply channels, which impacts the ways in which distributors are being
compensated by manufacturers. For instance, certain types of vendor product incentives and sources
of supply, such as certain inventory purchases on the secondary market, are not available at
historical levels to the major distributors, which have the impact of reducing gross margins. We
have been actively working with manufacturers through restructured distribution agreements to
ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide and are
making solid progress toward this objective. However, if we fail to negotiate favorable terms, or
if we fail to negotiate successfully in a timely manner as we anticipate, such efforts by certain
pharmaceutical manufacturers could have an adverse impact on our profitability.

Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase
over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents. In recent years,
our revenues and gross margins have increased from our generic drug offering programs. An increase
or a decrease in the availability of these generic drugs could have a material impact on our net
income.

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state boards and
comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the
introduction of counterfeit drugs, adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical
distribution system. Certain states, such as Florida, have already adopted laws and regulations
that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system while other
government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. These laws and regulations
could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical
distribution business, and may negatively impact our operating results.

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and
regulations relating to healthcare fraud. The federal government continues to strengthen its
position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting the Medicare, Medicaid
and other government healthcare programs. Furthermore, our relationships with pharmaceutical
manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and
abuse. Many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives
offered by pharmaceutical or medical-surgical suppliers, are vague or indefinite and have not been
interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or
judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties,
including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal and state healthcare programs.

Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”),
the U.S. government recently proposed changes in certain pharmaceutical reimbursement rates. We may be adversely impacted by changes or changes that may be proposed in
the future under the Act. We are in the process of developing plans
to mitigate any exposures from these changes in reimbursement rates and the way our customers
conduct their business under the Act. However, if we fail to successfully implement such plans,
our business and the results of operations may be adversely impacted.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Substantial defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of our products by large
customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of
operations and liquidity.

In recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of
large customers. During the year ended March 31, 2005, sales to our ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 50% of our total consolidated revenues (including sales to customers’
warehouses). Sales to our largest customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented approximately 10% of
our 2005 total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2005, accounts receivable from our ten largest
customers and Rite Aid Corporation were approximately 49% and 7% of total accounts receivable. As
a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. Any defaults in payment or a material
reduction in purchases from this or any other large customer could have a significant negative
impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments are dependent upon
sophisticated information systems. The implementation delay, malfunction or failure of these
systems for any extended period of time could adversely affect our business.

We rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process,
analyze and manage data to: facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory
items from numerous distribution centers; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;
manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and process payments to
suppliers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if these
systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, or fail for any extended period of time.

We could become subject to liability claims that are not adequately covered by our insurance, and
may have to pay damages and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution and dispensing of
pharmaceuticals, the provision of ancillary services (such as our pharmacy management business) and
the conduct of our medical management businesses (which include disease management programs and our
nurse triage services.) A successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by
our insurance or any applicable contractual indemnity could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

The ability of our Provider Technologies business to attract and retain customers due to challenges
in software product integration and technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or
increase our expenses.

Our Provider Technologies business delivers enterprise-wide patient care, clinical, financial,
managed care, payor and strategic management software solutions, as well as networking
technologies, electronic commerce, outsourcing and other services to healthcare organizations
throughout the United States and certain foreign countries. Challenges in integrating Provider
Technologies software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and may
reduce our revenues or increase our expenses.

Future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies,
products or services that are competitive with the products and services offered by our Provider
Technologies business. Such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and
services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure. The success of our Provider
Technologies business will depend, in part, on its ability to be responsive to technological
developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. To remain competitive in the
evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our Provider Technologies business must
develop new products on a timely basis. The failure to develop competitive products and to
introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our Provider Technologies
business to attract and retain customers and thereby significantly reduce our net income.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The loss of third party licenses utilized by our Provider Technologies segment may adversely impact
our operating results.

We license the rights to use certain technologies from third-party vendors to incorporate in
or complement our Provider Technologies segment products and solutions. These licenses are
generally nonexclusive, must be renewed periodically by mutual consent, and may be terminated if we
breach the terms of the license. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product
shipments until we obtain equivalent technology, which could hurt our business. Our competitors
may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology
to compete directly with us. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the
licensed technology in the future, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products.

Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and proprietary rights may infringe on the
rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure
and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights to our
products. There can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our
competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technology. Although we believe that our products and other proprietary rights do
not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have
asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not
assert infringement claims against us in the future. If we were found to be infringing on other’s
rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing

technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing property.
Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to
enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights, and to determine the scope and validity of the
proprietary rights of others. These types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. These
litigation expenses, damage payments, or cessation of use of infringing technology and development
of respective replacement technology could be significant and result in material losses to us.

Potential product liability claims arising from healthcare information technology business products
could result in material losses to us.

We provide products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical
histories and treatment plans. If these products fail to provide accurate and timely information,
customers could assert liability claims against us. Litigation with respect to liability claims,
regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management’s attention
from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. We attempt to limit, by contract,
our liability for damages from negligence, errors or mistakes. Despite this precaution, the
limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise
protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including
coverage for errors and omissions. However, this coverage may not continue to be available on
acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims
against us. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim.

System errors and warranties in Provider Technologies segment’s products could cause unforeseen
liabilities.

Our Provider Technologies segment’s software and software systems (“systems”) are very
complex. As with complex systems offered by others, our systems may contain errors, especially
when first introduced. Our Provider Technologies business systems are intended to provide
information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our systems
have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. Failure of a
client’s system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of
warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with
the documentation. If such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a
material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of
amounts previously paid, or assert claims for significant damages.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Potential regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of Provider Technologies
products as medical devices could impose increased costs, delay the introduction of new products
and negatively impact our business.

The FDA is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for
use in the healthcare industry. The FDA has increasingly focused on the regulation of computer
products and computer-assisted products as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act. If the FDA chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices, it can impose
extensive requirements upon us. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the FDA
could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product
corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing
clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. Any final FDA policy governing computer products,
once issued, may increase the cost and time to market new or existing products or may prevent us
from marketing our products.

New and potential federal regulations relating to patient confidentiality and format and data
content standards could depress the demand for our Provider Technologies products and impose
significant product redesign costs and unforeseen liabilities on us.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances
under which those records may be released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of
confidential patient medical record information and will require the users of such information to
implement specified security measures. Regulations currently in place governing electronic health
data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires national
standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used
in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health
information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information.
Healthcare organizations were required to comply with the privacy standards by April 2003 and
additional transaction regulations by October 2003. Such organizations must also be in compliance
with security regulations by April 2005.

Provider Technologies systems have been updated and modified to comply with the current
requirements of HIPAA. In addition, the division has been testing and sending HIPAA compliant
transactions through its clearinghouse directly to payors and to competitive clearinghouses.
However, not all testing is complete, and there are payors and competitive clearinghouses which
cannot yet accommodate all HIPAA compliant transactions. As of March 31, 2005, over 95% of all
electronic claims transmitted directly by Provider Technologies to payors and competitive cleaning
houses are in a HIPAA compliant format. As the remaining payors and other clearing houses indicate
their readiness to accept HIPAA compliant transactions, our conversion and testing efforts will
continue. CMS has implemented a flexible, complaint-driven enforcement strategy regarding
electronic transactions, taking into account good faith efforts to comply with the HIPAA standards.
It is possible, however, that CMS may change its existing enforcement strategy in the future in a
manner that increases the likelihood of fines or penalties for non-compliance with standards. To
the extent that other payors adopt policies similar to CMS regarding adjudication and payment of
nonstandard electronic transactions and testing of standard transactions has not been completed
with such payors, payor reimbursement of claims submitted by customers through the McKesson
clearinghouse may be slowed, thereby negatively impacting the demand for our clearinghouse services
and negatively affecting our financial condition

.

Evolving HIPAA-related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to
obtain, use or disseminate patient information. This could adversely affect demand for our
products if they are not re-designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any
new regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our
customers to execute new or modified healthcare transactions. We may need to expend additional
capital, research and development and other resources to modify our products to address these
evolving data security and privacy issues.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Due to the length of our sales and implementation cycles for our Provider Technologies segment, our
future operating results may be impacted.

Our Provider Technologies segment has long sales and implementation cycles, which could range
from several months to over two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion
of implementation. How and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify
or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. The solutions we
provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer.
Any decision by our customers to delay implementation may adversely affect our revenues.
Furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a
breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction
in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue.

Reduced capacity in the commercial property insurance market exposes us to potential loss.

In order to provide prompt and complete service to our major Pharmaceutical Solutions
customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. While
we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can
be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. One
or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our
coverage limits could materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions
successfully.

An element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either
expand or complement our business. Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks,
including the diversion of management’s attention to the assimilation of the operations of
businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the
realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of
the acquired companies; challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses; and
potential adverse effects on operating results. In addition, we may potentially require additional
financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable. If we are
unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our
business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected.

In addition to the above, the following factors could affect future results: changes in
generally accepted accounting principles, including the requirement by accounting setting standards
boards to expense stock options; tax legislation initiatives, foreign currency fluctuations and
general economic and market conditions.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of McKesson Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2005.

McKesson Corporation’s independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on our management’s assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting. This audit report appears on page 51 of this annual report on

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The Stockholders and Board of Directors of

McKesson
Corporation:

We
have audited management’s assessment, included in  the
accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting” that McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for
the year ended March 31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated May 12, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule.

McKESSON CORPORATION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors of

McKesson Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended March 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a). These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries at March 31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended March 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

FINANCIAL NOTES

1.

Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations.

The consolidated financial statements of McKesson Corporation
(“McKesson,” the “Company,” or “we” and other similar pronouns) include the financial statements of
all majority-owned or controlled companies. Significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless
otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year.

We conduct our business through three segments. Through our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment,
we are a leading distributor of ethical and proprietary drugs, and health and beauty care products
throughout North America. This segment also manufactures and sells automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems for retail pharmacies, and provides medical management and specialty
pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, patient and other services
for payors, and software, and consulting and outsourcing services to pharmacies. Our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distributes medical-surgical supplies, first-aid products and
equipment, and provides logistics and other services within the United States and Canada. Our
Provider Technologies segment delivers enterprise-wide patient care, clinical, financial, supply
chain, managed care and strategic management software solutions, automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems for hospitals, as well as outsourcing and other services, to healthcare
organizations throughout North America, the United Kingdom and other European countries.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. In addition, we have revised the presentation of our 2004 and 2003
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to include cash flows from notes receivable related to sales
of inventory as an operating cash flow. These amounts were previously included in cash flows from
investing activities. Cash flows from notes receivable generally relate to the sale of automated
pharmacy and supply management systems to hospitals and retail pharmacies, as well as the
subsequent sale of those notes receivable to a third party. These reclassifications resulted from
guidance recently issued by Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff to all public
registrants.

The table below reconciles the revised presentation of our Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows to our prior presentation:

In April 2004, we reconfigured our operating segments to better align product development and
selling efforts with the evolving needs of the healthcare market. Accordingly, historical segment
information has been reclassified to conform with the new presentation.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

include all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity
of three months or less at the date of acquisition.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale

are carried at fair value and the net unrealized
gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in marking these securities to market
have been reported within stockholders’ equity.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories for the Pharmaceutical
Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments consist of merchandise held for resale. For our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined on
the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method and international inventories are stated using the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO”) method. Cost of inventories for our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment is
primarily determined on the FIFO method. Provider Technologies segment inventories consist of
computer hardware with cost determined either by the specific identification or the FIFO method.
The LIFO method is used to value approximately 90% of our inventories at March 31, 2005 and 2004.
Total inventories before the LIFO cost adjustment, which approximates replacement cost, were
$7,682.7 million and $6,981.5 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004. Vendor rebates, allowances and
chargebacks received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of
inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold.

Property, Plant and Equipment

is stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method at
rates designed to distribute the cost of properties over estimated service lives ranging from one
to 30 years.

Capitalized Software Held for Sale

consists of development costs for software held for sale
primarily for our Provider Technologies segment. Such costs are capitalized once a project has
reached the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching
the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life
of approximately three years. We monitor the net realizable value of capitalized software held for
sale to ensure that the investment will be recovered through future sales.

Additional information regarding our capitalized software expenditures is as follows:

Long-lived Assets.

We assess the recoverability of goodwill on at least an annual basis and
other long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets,
including goodwill, which we expect to hold and use, is based on estimated fair values of the
assets. Estimates of fair values are based on quoted market prices, when available, the results of
valuation techniques utilizing discounted cash flows (using the lowest level of identifiable cash
flows) or fundamental analysis. Long-lived assets to be disposed of, either by sale or
abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use

is amortized over estimated useful lives ranging
from one to ten years and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As of
March 31, 2005 and 2004, capitalized software held for internal use was $410.1 million and $389.3
million, net of accumulated amortization of $243.0 million and $182.0 million.

Insurance Programs.

Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain coverage for catastrophic
exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is our policy to
retain a significant portion of certain losses primarily related to workers’ compensation and
comprehensive general, product, and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under these
programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred as
well as for claims incurred but not yet reported. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial
assumptions followed in the insurance industry.

Revenue Recognition

. Revenues for our Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions
segments are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, product delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered, there are no further obligations to customers, and collectability is probable.
Revenues for performance-based contracts, whereby revenue is dependent upon successful predefined
outcomes, are recognized by measuring actual results against the expected performance criteria.

Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances and rebates. Sales returns are
recorded when goods are returned to us and are generally not accepted unless the inventory can be
returned to the manufacturer for credit. Commencing in 2005, the Company changed its accounting
policy for customer sales returns to reflect an accrual for estimated customer returns at the time
of sales to the customer in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 48, “Revenue Recognition when Right of Return Exists.” Previously, the Company accounted for
customer sales returns as a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold at the time of the return.
This change in accounting policy did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. Sales returns were approximately $853 million, $766 million and $755 million in 2005,
2004 and 2003. Amounts recorded in revenue and cost of sales under our previous accounting policy
approximated what would have been recorded under SFAS No. 48.

Included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment revenues are large volume sales of
pharmaceuticals to a limited number of large self-warehousing customers whereby we order and
subsequently deliver bulk products directly from the manufacturer to the customers’ warehouses
through a central distribution facility. In addition to these revenues, we also record revenues
associated with direct store deliveries from most of these same customers. Sales to customer
warehouses amounted to $24.1 billion in 2005, $21.6 billion in 2004, and $14.8 billion in 2003.
These sales are recorded gross as we take title to and possession of the inventory and assume the
risk of loss for collection, delivery or return. We have significantly lower gross margin on these
sales as we pass much of the efficiencies of this low cost-to-serve model on to the customer.
These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars in that the volume allows us to
earn incremental product sourcing profits.

Revenues for our Provider Technologies segment are generated primarily by licensing software
systems (consisting of software, hardware and maintenance support), and providing outsourcing and
professional services. Revenue for this segment is recognized as follows:



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service
agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of delivery or under the
percentage-of-completion method in accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software
Revenue Recognition,” and SOP 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts,” based on the terms and conditions in the contract. Contracts accounted
for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on the ratio of labor
costs incurred to date to total estimated labor costs to be incurred. Changes in estimates to
complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to earnings in
the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current
estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.

Hardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue from multi-year software
license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software implementation
fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion contract method.
Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or multiyear agreements and are
recognized ratably over the period covered by the agreements. Remote processing service fees are
recognized monthly as the service is performed. Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the
service is performed.

We also offer our products on an application service provider (“ASP”) basis, making available
our software functionality on a remote hosting basis from our data centers. The data centers
provide system and administrative support as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on
an ASP basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract starting when the
hosting services begin.

This segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain any combination
of software, hardware, implementation or consulting services, or maintenance services. When some
elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value (“VSOE”) exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered elements is
recognized upon delivery of such items. The segment establishes VSOE for hardware and
implementation and consulting services based on the price charged when sold separately, and for
maintenance services, based on renewal rates offered to customers. Revenue for the software
element is recognized under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all
of the undelivered elements in an arrangement. If fair value cannot be established for any
undelivered element, all of the arrangement’s revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last
element or until the fair value of the undelivered element is determinable.

Income Taxes

. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Foreign Currency Translation.

Assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated
at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative currency translation adjustments are
included in accumulated other comprehensive losses in the stockholders’ equity section of the
consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions are
recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material
to our consolidated results of operations in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Derivative Financial Instruments

. Derivative financial instruments are used principally in
the management of our foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded on the balance
sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the
fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive losses and are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged
item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are
recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are
marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in earnings.

Concentrations of Credit Risk.

Trade receivables subject us to a concentration of credit risk
with customers primarily in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. A significant proportion of our
revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers and as a result, our credit
concentration has increased. Accordingly, any defaults in payment by or a reduction in purchases
from these large customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition,
results of operations and liquidity. At March 31, 2005, revenues and accounts receivable from our
ten largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of consolidated revenues and approximately
49% of accounts receivable. Fiscal 2005 revenues and March 31, 2005 receivables from our largest
customer, Rite Aid Corporation, represented approximately 10% of total consolidated revenues and 7%
of accounts receivable. We have also provided financing arrangements to certain of our customers
within our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, some of which are on a revolving basis. At March 31,
2005, these customer financing arrangements totaled approximately $206 million.

Accounts Receivable Sales.

At March 31, 2005, we had a $1.4 billion revolving receivables
sales facility, which was fully available. The program qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No.
140, “Accounting For Transfers and Servicing Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”
Sales are recorded at the estimated fair values of the receivables sold, reflecting discounts for
the time value of money based on U.S. commercial paper rates and estimated loss provisions.
Discounts are recorded in administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Employee Stock Options.

We account for our employee stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” We apply the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure.” Had compensation cost for our employee stock-based compensation been
recognized based on the fair value method, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, net
income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share would have been as follows:

In 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”)
approved the accelerated vesting of substantially all unvested stock options outstanding whose
exercise price was equal to or greater than $28.20, or substantially all of the total unvested
stock options outstanding. SFAS No. 123 expense related to this acceleration amounted to
approximately $117 million (or $0.39 per diluted share) on an after-tax basis. In 2005, we granted
6.3 million stock options. Substantially all of these options vested on or before March 31, 2005.
Prior to 2004, stock options typically vested over a four year period. The 2004 accelerated
vesting and 2005 shorter vesting periods were approved by the Committee for employee retention
purposes and in anticipation of the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R). As further discussed in this
financial note, under the caption, “New Accounting Pronouncements”, when adopted by us in 2007,
SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to recognize the fair value of the equity awards granted to employees
as an expense. In addition, this standard requires that the fair value of the unvested equity
awards outstanding as of April 1, 2006 be recognized at the grant-date fair value as the remaining
requisite service is rendered. The pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123 will be prospectively
eliminated. Accordingly, SFAS No. 123 expense of approximately $117 million (after-tax) for the
stock option grants that received accelerated vesting in 2004, as well as the related compensation
expense associated with the 2005 fully vested stock options, will not be recognized in our earnings
after SFAS 123(R) is adopted.

New Accounting Pronouncements

. In January 2004, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. FAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) allows employers that sponsor a postretirement plan providing
a qualifying or eligible prescription drug benefit to receive a federal subsidy. As permitted by
FSP No. FAS 106-1, we elected to defer recognizing the effects of the Act until authoritative
guidance on accounting for the new subsidy was issued. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS
106-2 which provides accounting guidance for this new subsidy. Management has concluded that the
prescription drug benefits provided to our Medicare-eligible retirees are actuarially equivalent
based on the current interpretation of the guidance included in the Act and accordingly, the
Company adopted the provisions of FSP No. FAS 106-2 in the second quarter of 2005. The expected
subsidy had the effect of reducing the Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $19 million. This reduction is recognized as an actuarial gain and is being
amortized over three years. The expected subsidy also resulted in a nominal reduction in interest
cost in 2005. As required by this FSP, the Company recognized reductions in postretirement benefit
expense of $7.4 million in 2005.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs — an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting guidance included in Accounting Research
Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing” related to abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling and spoilage costs. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory
costs incurred during 2007. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 151 on our
consolidated financial statements; however, we do not believe the adoption of this standard will
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which requires the
recognition of cost resulting from transactions in which the Company acquires goods and services by
issuing its shares, share options, or other equity instruments. This standard requires a fair
value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions. This standard
replaces SFAS No. 123, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, the use of the intrinsic
value method as provided under APB Opinion No. 25 will be eliminated. Based on guidance provided
by the SEC in April 2005, SFAS No. 123(R) will become effective for us no later than 2007. The
Company intends to adopt this standard using the modified prospective method of transition. This
transition method requires that compensation cost be recognized for new awards granted and awards
modified, repurchased or cancelled after April 1, 2006. This method also requires us to recognize
cost for the unvested portion of all awards issued prior to and outstanding as of April 1, 2006 at
the grant-date fair value as the remaining requisite service is rendered. In addition, under SFAS
No. 123(R), we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based
payments and the amortization method for compensation cost. We are currently assessing the impact
of SFAS No. 123(R) on our consolidated financial statements, however, we do believe that this
standard could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,” which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not culminate an earning process under
APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions.” SFAS No. 153 requires that
measurement be based on the recorded amount of the assets relinquished for nonmonetary exchanges
that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the
future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
This standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in 2007. We do not believe
the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA provides a new deduction for certain qualified
domestic production activities. FSP No. 109-1 is effective immediately and clarifies that such
deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction, not as a tax rate reduction, under SFAS
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” no earlier than the year in which the deduction is reported
on the tax return. We are currently evaluating whether such deduction may be available to us and
its impact on our consolidated financial statements. We will recognize the tax benefit of such
deductions, if any, beginning in 2006.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The
AJCA provides a one-time 85% dividends received deduction for certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated under a plan for reinvestment in the United States, provided certain criteria are met.
FSP No. 109-2 is effective immediately and provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the
repatriation provision. FSP No. 109-2 allows companies additional time to evaluate the effects of
the law on its unremitted earnings for the purpose of applying the “indefinite reversal criteria”
under APB Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes — Special Areas,” and requires explanatory
disclosures from companies that have not yet completed the evaluation. The Company is currently
evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision and their impact on our consolidated financial
statements. We expect to complete this evaluation before the end of 2006. The range of possible amounts of unremitted earnings that is being considered for
repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million. The related potential range of
income tax is between zero and $27.7 million.

In March 2005, SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based
Payment”, which provides guidance on the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules
and regulations, as well as on the valuation of share-based payments. SAB No. 107 does not modify
any of the requirements under SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 provides interpretive guidance related
to valuation methods (including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term),
first-time adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in an interim period, the classification of compensation
expense and disclosures subsequent to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We are currently evaluating the
impact of SAB No. 107 on our consolidated financial statements.

2. Acquisitions and Investments

We made the following acquisitions and investments:

•

In 2005, we invested $32.7 million in return for a 79.7% interest
in Pahema, S.A. de C.V. (“Pahema”), a Mexican holding company.
Two additional investors, owners of approximately 30% of the
outstanding shares of Nadro S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”) (collectively,
“investors”), contributed $9.6 million for the remaining interest
in Pahema. In December 2004, Pahema completed a 6.50 Mexican
Pesos per share, or approximately $164 million, tender offer for
approximately 284 million shares (or approximately 46%) of the
outstanding publicly held shares of common stock of Nadro. Pahema
financed the tender offer utilizing the cash contributed by us and
the investors, and borrowings totaling 1.375 billion Mexican
Pesos, in the form of two notes with Mexican financial
institutions. Subsequently, the common stock of Pahema was
exchanged for common stock of Nadro, resulting in the merger of
the two companies. As a result, we currently own approximately
49% of Nadro. Prior to the tender offer, we owned approximately
22% of the outstanding common shares of Nadro. We continue to
utilize the equity method in accounting for our investment in
Nadro.

•

In the first quarter of 2005, we acquired all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Moore Medical Corp. (“MMC”), of New Britain,
Connecticut, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately
$37 million. MMC is an Internet-enabled, multi-channel marketer
and distributor of medical-surgical and pharmaceutical products to
non-hospital provider settings. Approximately $19 million of the
purchase price has been assigned to goodwill, none of which is
deductible for tax purposes. The results of MMC’s operations have
been included in the consolidated financial statements within our
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment since the acquisition date.

•

In 2003, we acquired the outstanding stock of A.L.I. Technologies
Inc. (“A.L.I.”) for an aggregate cash purchase price of $347.0
million. A.L.I. provides digital medical imaging solutions, which
are designed to streamline access to diagnostic information,
automate clinical workflow and eliminate the need for film
purchase and storage. The acquisition of A.L.I. complemented our
Horizon Clinicals™ offering by incorporating medical images into a
computerized patient record. Approximately $328 million of
A.L.I.’s purchase price was assigned to goodwill, none of which is
deductible for tax purposes. The aggregate purchase price was
financed through cash and short-term borrowings. The results of
A.L.I.’s operations have been included in the consolidated
financial statements within our Provider Technologies segment
since its acquisition date.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

•

In 2003, we purchased the remaining interest in an investment of our Pharmaceutical Solutions
segment for approximately $32 million, retained a small portion of the business and subsequently
sold the balance for approximately $40 million, the proceeds of which consisted of an interest
bearing ten-year note receivable, resulting in a nominal loss.

During the last three years we also completed several smaller acquisitions and investments
within all three of our operating segments. Purchase prices have been allocated based on estimated
fair values at the date of acquisition and may be subject to change. Pro forma results of
operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the effects were not
material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or aggregate basis.

3.

Divestiture

In 2003, we sold the net assets of a marketing fulfillment business which was previously
included in our Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Net proceeds from the sale of this business were
$4.5 million. The disposition resulted in an after-tax loss of $3.7 million or $0.01 per diluted
share. The net assets and results of operations of this business have been presented as a
discontinued operation.

4.

Contracts

In 2003, we recorded a $51.0 million provision for expected losses on five multi-year
contracts in our Provider Technologies segment’s international business. Substantially all of the
expected losses pertain to contracts that were entered into in 2001 or earlier. These contracts
contained multiple-element deliverables, including customization of software. In addition, these
contracts place significant reliance on third party vendors as well as the customers.

During the software development and implementation phases of these contracts, despite
experiencing certain operational issues, we believed these contracts could be fully performed on a
timely basis and remain profitable. In 2003, after experiencing numerous delays in product
delivery and functionality, we conducted a reassessment of the contract delivery and project
methodology, including assessment of our third party vendors’ ability to perform under these
contracts. We determined that certain contract obligations, including software functionality,
could not be met within existing contract cost estimates and delivery dates. Accordingly in 2003,
we reassessed our estimate of the costs to fulfill our contract obligations and recorded a $51.0
million provision for the expected contract losses.

During the third quarter of 2004, the Company and a customer decided to exit one contract and
had commenced discussions to mutually terminate the contract and negotiate settlement terms and
conditions, and as a result, we recorded an additional $20.0 million contract loss provision. In
the fourth quarter of 2004, we reduced our accrued contract loss provision by $15.2 million
primarily to reflect the final terms and conditions of our termination agreement with this
customer.

In 2005 and 2004, net charges for restructuring activities, excluding customer settlement
reserve reversals, amounted to $0.5 million and $3.8 million. These charges related to a number of
smaller initiatives offset in part by adjustments to prior years’ restructuring reserves.

In 2003, net credits for restructuring activities, excluding customer settlement reserve
reversals, amounted to $4.8 million. These net credits primarily related to $12.0 million of
reversals of severance and exit-related accruals pertaining to our re-evaluation of our 2002
Medical-Surgical Solutions segment distribution center network consolidation plan. The original
consolidation plan included a net reduction of 20 distribution centers, from 51, compared to a net
reduction of 14 under the revised plan. Net credits for 2003 also include $5.1 million of charges
for additional facility closure costs associated with prior years’ restructuring plans in our
Pharmaceutical Solutions segment.

Accrued restructuring liabilities are included in other liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. In connection with the acquisition of MMC in 2005, we recorded $1.7 million of
liabilities for employee severance costs. The balances at March 31, 2004 for Corporate included
approximately $7 million of retirement costs, which were paid in April 2004.

In addition to the above restructuring activities, we are still managing a 2001/2000
restructuring plan associated with customer settlements for the discontinuance of overlapping and
nonstrategic products and other product development projects within our Provider Technologies
segment. Customer settlement reserves were established, reviewed and assessed on a customer and
contract specific basis, and actual settlements for each customer varied significantly depending on
the specific mix and number of products, and each customer contract or contracts. In 2005, 2004
and 2003, we reversed $4.0 million, $66.4 million and $22.3 million of accrued customer settlement
reserves into operating expenses due to favorable settlements and negotiations with affected
customers. There have been no significant offsetting changes in estimates that increase the
provision for customer settlements. Total cash and non-cash settlements of $45.3 million and $95.6
million have been incurred since the inception of this restructuring plan. Non-cash settlements
represent write-offs of customer receivables.

During the third quarter of 2003, we had completed, on a cumulative basis, settlements with
71% of our affected customers. Additionally, we announced the general availability of a critical
software component of our clinical strategy, which helped us refine our estimate of customers
expected to move forward with the clinical product replacements and provided a more favorable
prognosis of remaining settlements. Accordingly, we reversed $22.3 million of the customer
settlement reserve in the fiscal year. In 2004, we had significant settlement activity, including
the completion and execution of a number of the more difficult customer settlements. As of March
31, 2004, we were substantially complete (97%) with our customer settlements. As a result, the
customer settlement reserve was reduced by $66.4 million. The reserves were further reduced by
$4.0 million based on favorable settlements finalized as of March 31, 2005. We do not anticipate
additional significant adjustments to the customer settlement reserves.

Gain (loss) on investments includes gains and losses from the sale or liquidation of
investments and other-than-temporary impairment losses. We recorded other-than-temporary
impairment losses of $1.5 million and $8.5 million in 2004 and 2003 on equity investments as a
result of significant declines in the market values of these investments. We used quoted market
prices, if available, to determine the fair value of our investments. For investments that do not
trade regularly, we estimated fair value using a variety of pricing techniques including discounted
cash flow analyses and market transactions.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that it reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. For 2005, because of our reported net loss, potentially dilutive
securities were excluded from the per share computations due to their antidilutive effect.

McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures

In February 1997, we issued 5% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures”)
in an aggregate principal amount of $206,186,000. The Debentures, which are included in long-term
debt, mature on June 1, 2027, bear interest at an annual rate of 5%, payable quarterly, and are
currently redeemable by us at 101.0% of the principal amount. The Debentures were purchased by the
McKesson Financing Trust (“Trust”), which is wholly owned by the Company, with proceeds from its
issuance of four million shares of preferred securities to the public and 123,720 common securities
to us. These preferred securities are convertible at the holder’s option into the Company’s common
stock. The Debentures represent the sole assets of the Trust. The Company was not designated as
the primary beneficiary of the Trust and as a result, does not consolidate its investment in the
Trust.

Holders of the preferred securities are entitled to cumulative cash distributions at an annual
rate of 5% of the liquidation amount of $50 per security. Each preferred security is convertible
at the rate of 1.3418 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances. The preferred securities will be redeemed upon repayment of the Debentures and are
callable by us on or after March 4, 2000, in whole or in part, initially at 103.5% of the
liquidation preference per share, and thereafter at prices declining at 0.5% per annum to 100% of
the liquidation preference on and after March 4, 2007 plus, in each case, accumulated, accrued and
unpaid distributions, if any, to the redemption date.

We have guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, distributions and other payments due on the
preferred securities (the “Guarantee”). The Guarantee, when taken together with our obligations
under the Debentures, and in the indenture pursuant to which the Debentures were issued, and our
obligations under the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust governing the subsidiary trust,
provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the preferred securities.

Other Financing

In September 2004, we entered into a $1.3 billion five-year, senior unsecured revolving credit
facility. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a fixed base rate, or a
floating rate based on the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) rate or a Eurodollar rate.
Effective as of the closing date of the new credit facility agreement, we terminated the
commitments under a $550 million, three-year revolving credit facility that would have expired in
September 2005 and a $650 million, 364-day credit facility that would have expired in September
2004. At March 31, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.

In June 2004, we renewed our committed revolving receivables sale facility under substantially
similar terms to those previously in place, with the exception that the facility was increased by
$300.0 million to $1.4 billion. The renewed facility expires in June 2005. At March 31, 2005 and
March 31, 2004, no amounts were outstanding or utilized under the receivables sale facility.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we sold customer lease portfolio receivables for cash proceeds of
$50.7 million, $45.4 million and $117.9 million.

The employee stock ownership program (“ESOP”) debt bears interest at rates ranging from 8.6%
fixed rate to approximately 89% of the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) or LIBOR plus 0.4%
and is due in semi-annual and annual installments through 2009.

Our various borrowing facilities and certain long-term debt instruments are subject to
covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio, which cannot exceed 56.5%.
If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility and
$235.0 million of term debt could be accelerated. At March 31, 2005, this ratio was 18.7% and we
were in compliance with all other covenants.

Aggregate annual payments on long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, for the
years ending March 31, are as follows: $8.8 million in 2006, $27.5 million in 2007, $157.5 million
in 2008, $8.0 million in 2009, $222.9 million in 2010 and $785.8 million thereafter.

13. Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

At March 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, receivables, drafts and accounts payable, and other liabilities approximated their
estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying
amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt were $1,210.5 million and $1,334.5 million
at March 31, 2005 and $1,484.6 million and $1,701.8 million at March 31, 2004. The estimated fair
value of our long-term debt was determined based on quoted market prices and may not be
representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the
future.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations. We limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and
forward contracts. In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes.
We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The net fair value of our derivatives was as follows:

14. Lease Obligations

We lease facilities and equipment under both capital and operating leases. Net assets held
under capital leases included in property, plant and equipment were $3.0 million and $4.5 million
at March 31, 2005 and 2004. Rental expense under operating leases was $115.4 million, $111.0
million and $109.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease, taking into account, when applicable, lessor incentives for
tenant improvements, periods where no rent payment is required and escalations in rent payments
over the term of the lease. Deferred rent is recognized for the difference between the rent
expense recognized on a straight-line basis and the payments made per the terms of the lease. Most
real property leases contain renewal options and provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and
operating expenses in excess of base period amounts.

15. Pension Benefits

We maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and defined
contribution plans for eligible employees.

Defined Pension Benefit Plans

Eligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company prior to December 31, 1996 are
covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan. In 1997, we amended this plan
to freeze all plan benefits based on each employee’s plan compensation and creditable service
accrued to that date. The Company has made no annual contributions since this plan was frozen.
The benefits for this defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at
date of retirement, years of service and employees’ pay during the five years prior to retirement.
We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible Canadian and United Kingdom employees as
well as nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plans for certain U.S. executives, which are
non-funded. The measurement date for all of our pension plans is December 31.

The net periodic expense for our pension plans is as follows:

over the remaining future service periods.

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Additional minimum liabilities were established to increase accrued benefit cost, totaling
$43.6 million and $46.2 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004 for our plans. The additional minimum
liabilities were partially offset by intangible assets of $15.0 million and $5.9 million at March
31, 2005 and 2004, and charged to other comprehensive loss included in the consolidated
stockholders’ equity, net of tax.

Projected benefit obligations relating to our unfunded U.S. plans were $77.9 million and $99.3
million at March 31, 2005 and 2004. Pension costs are funded based on the recommendations of
independent actuaries. We expect contributions for our pension plans in 2006 to be approximately
$10 million.

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Other Defined Benefit Plans

Under various U.S. bargaining unit labor contracts, we make payments into multi-employer
pension plans established for union employees. We are liable for a proportionate part of the
plans’ unfunded vested benefits liabilities upon our withdrawal from the plan, however information
regarding the relative position of each employer with respect to the actuarial present value of
accumulated benefits and net assets available for benefits is not available. Contributions to the
plans and amounts accrued were not material for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have a contributory profit sharing investment plan (“PSIP”) for U.S. employees not covered
by collective bargaining arrangements. Eligible employees may contribute up to 20% of their
compensation to an individual retirement savings account. The Company makes matching contributions
equal to or greater than 50% of employee contributions, not to exceed 3% of employee compensation.
An additional annual matching contribution may be granted at the discretion of the Company. The
Company provides for the PSIP contributions primarily with its common shares through its leveraged
ESOP or cash payments.

The ESOP has purchased an aggregate of 24.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock since
its inception. These purchases were financed by 10 to 20-year loans from or guaranteed by us. The
ESOP’s outstanding borrowings are reported as long-term debt of the Company and the related
receivables from the ESOP are shown as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. The loans are repaid
by the ESOP from interest earnings on cash balances and common dividends on shares not yet
allocated to participants, common dividends on certain allocated shares and Company cash
contributions. The ESOP loan maturities and rates are identical to the terms of related Company
borrowings. Stock is made available from the ESOP based on debt service payments on ESOP
borrowings.

Contribution expense for the PSIP in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was primarily ESOP related.
After-tax ESOP expense and other contribution expense, including interest expense on ESOP debt, was
$9.1 million, $7.8 million and $7.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Approximately 0.8 million, 1.6
million and 1.7 million shares of common stock were allocated to plan participants in 2005, 2004
and 2003. Through March 31, 2005, 21.6 million common shares have been allocated to plan
participants, resulting in a balance of 2.7 million common shares in the ESOP, which have not yet
been allocated to plan participants.

16. Other Postretirement Benefits

We maintain a number of postretirement benefits, consisting of healthcare and life insurance
benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees. Eligible employees consist of those who retired
before March 31, 1999 and those who retire after March 31, 1999, but were an active employee as of
that date, after meeting other age-related criteria. We also provide postretirement benefits for
certain U.S. executives. The measurement date for our postretirement
plans is December 31.

As described in Note 1, we adopted the provisions of FSP No. FAS 106-2 in the second quarter
of 2005. The expected Medicare subsidy had the effect of reducing the Company’s accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $19 million. This reduction is recognized as
an actuarial gain and amortized over three years. The expected
subsidy also resulted in a nominal reduction in
interest cost in 2005. As required by the FSP, the Company recognized
total reductions in postretirement benefit expense of $7.4 million in 2005.

In 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of $390 million for the Securities Litigation
described in more detail in Financial Note 19. We believe the settlement of the consolidated
securities class action and the ultimate resolution of the lawsuits brought independently by other
shareholders will be tax deductible. However, the tax attributes of the litigation are complex and
the Company expects challenges from the taxing authorities, and accordingly such
deductions will not be finalized until all the lawsuits are concluded and an examination of the
Company’s tax returns is completed. Accordingly, we have provided a reserve of $85 million for
future resolution of these uncertain tax matters. While we believe the tax reserve is adequate,
the ultimate resolution of these tax matters may exceed or be below the reserve.

In 2005, we recorded a $9.6 million income tax benefit arising primarily from settlements and
adjustments with various taxing authorities and a $2.8 million income tax benefit primarily due to
a reduction of a valuation allowance related to state income tax net operating loss carryforwards.
We believe that the income tax benefit from a portion of these state net operating loss
carryforwards will now be realized.

In 2004, we recorded a $23.2 million income tax benefit relating to favorable tax settlements
with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and with various other taxing authorities. A large portion
of this benefit, which was not previously recognized by the Company, resulted from the filing of
amended tax returns by our subsidiary, McKesson Information Solutions LLC (formerly known as HBO &
Company (“HBOC”)) for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in determining the estimated worldwide provision for income taxes. During the
ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on
estimates of whether additional amounts will be due. As of March 31, 2005, approximately $242
million has been accrued for such matters. To the extent that the final tax



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such
differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.

The reconciliation between the Company’s effective tax rate on income from continuing
operations and the statutory tax rate is as follows:

Foreign pre-tax earnings were $235.4 million, $199.7 million and $152.2 million in 2005, 2004
and 2003. At March 31, 2005, undistributed earnings of our foreign operations totaling $621.9
million were considered to be permanently reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been
recognized for the remittance of such earnings to the U.S. since it is our intention to utilize
those earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development
activities for an indefinite period of time, or to repatriate such earnings when it is tax
efficient to do so. The determination of the amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not
practicable since the computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a
decision to repatriate the earnings is made.

As discussed in Note 1, on October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA provides
a one-time 85% dividends received deduction for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated under
a plan for reinvestment in the United States, provided certain criteria are met. FSP No. 109-2
allows companies additional time to evaluate the effects of the law on its unremitted earnings for
the purpose of applying the “indefinite reversal criteria” under APB Opinion No. 23, “Accounting
for Income Taxes — Special Areas”, and requires explanatory disclosures from companies that have
not yet completed the evaluation. The Company is currently analyzing the effects of the
repatriation provision and their impact on our consolidated financial statements. We expect to
complete this evaluation before the end of 2006. The range
of possible amounts of undistributed earnings that is being considered for repatriation under this
provision is between zero and $500 million. The related potential range of income tax is between
zero and $27.7 million.

We have income tax net operating loss carryforwards related to our U.K. operations of
approximately $88.3 million, which have an indefinite life.

We also have state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $259.6 million
which will expire at various dates from 2006 through 2025. We believe that it is more likely than
not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. In
recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $3.9 million on the deferred
tax assets relating to these state net operating loss carryforwards.

In 2005, we have reversed a portion of the valuation allowance related to these state net
operating loss carryforwards, of which $10.2 million of the tax benefit, net of impairment, was
credited to equity.

18. Financial Guarantees and Warranties

Financial Guarantees

We have agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions under which we have
guaranteed the repurchase of inventory (primarily for our Canadian business) at a discount in the
event these customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial institutions.
Among other requirements, these inventories must be in resalable condition. We have also
guaranteed loans, credit facilities and the payment of leases for some customers; and we are a
secured lender for substantially all of these guarantees. Customer guarantees range from one to
ten years and were primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain strategic customers. At
March 31, 2005, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer
guarantees were $179.5 million and $10.3 million of which a nominal amount had been accrued.

In 2004, a Pharmaceutical Solutions customer filed for bankruptcy. Accordingly, we reviewed
all amounts owed to us from this customer as well as financial guarantees provided to third parties
in favor of this customer, and



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

as a result, we increased our provision for doubtful accounts by $30.0 million. On April 21,
2004, we converted a $40.0 million credit facility guarantee in favor of this customer to a note
receivable due from this customer. This secured note bears interest and is repayable in 2007. In
conjunction with this modification, an inventory repurchase guarantee in favor of this customer for
approximately $12 million was also terminated. The amount due under the note receivable from this
customer was approximately $36 million at March 31, 2005.

At March 31, 2005, we had commitments of $8.5 million, primarily consisting of the purchase of
services from our equity-held investments, for which no amounts had been accrued.

The expirations of the above noted financial guarantees and commitments are as follows: $27.7
million, $34.8 million, $2.6 million, $1.6 million and $0.1 million from 2006 through 2010, and
$131.5 million thereafter.

In addition, our banks and insurance companies have issued $84.9 million of standby letters of
credit and surety bonds on our behalf in order to meet the security requirements for statutory
licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive
liability programs.

Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying
customers against liabilities if our software products infringe on a third party’s intellectual
property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such
indemnification agreements and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations.

In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine
indemnification agreements (such as retention of previously existing environmental, tax and
employee liabilities) whose terms vary in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where
appropriate, obligations for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the
amounts of these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum
amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as
liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have historically not made significant payments as a
result of these indemnification provisions.

Warranties

In the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and indemnification protection
for our products and services. For example, we provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and
medical-surgical products we distribute are in compliance with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
other applicable laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our suppliers,
which customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In addition, we have indemnity
obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been provided to us from our
suppliers, either through express agreement or by operation of law.

We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and automation products we
sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring the product into compliance with previously
agreed upon specifications. For software products, this may result in additional project costs,
which are reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for
software installation services within these contracts. In addition, most of our customers who
purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance agreements. Revenue
from these maintenance agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period
and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when claims become estimable.
Accrued warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets.

19. Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

I. Accounting Litigation

Since the announcements by McKesson in April, May and July of 1999 that McKesson had
determined that certain software sales transactions in its Information Solutions segment, formerly
HBO & Company (“HBOC”) and now known as McKesson Information Solutions LLC, were improperly
recorded as revenue and reversed, as of March 31, 2005, ninety-one lawsuits have been filed against
McKesson, HBOC, certain of McKesson’s or HBOC’s current or former officers or directors, and other
defendants, including Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. and Arthur Andersen LLP.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Federal Actions

On January 12, 2005, we announced that we reached an agreement to settle the
previously-reported class action in the Northern District of California captioned:

In re McKesson
HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation

(Case No. C-99-20743 RMW) (the “Consolidated Action”) pending
before the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District Court (the “Court”) for the
Northern District of California. In general, under the agreement to settle the Consolidated
Action, we will pay the settlement class a total of $960 million in cash and accordingly, in the
third quarter of 2005, we accrued this amount. The settlement will resolve the Consolidated Action
as to all defendants, other than Arthur Andersen LLP and Bear Stearns & Co Inc. Other previously
reported federal and state cases are not resolved by the settlement. The settlement agreement is
subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, preliminary approval by the Court,
notice to the Class and final approval by the Court after a hearing. Judge Whyte held a hearing on
March 25, 2005, to determine whether to grant preliminary approval of the settlement, but has not
yet issued a decision.

Consolidated Action.

The related federal class action,

In re McKesson HBOC Inc. ERISA Litigation

(Northern District
of California No. C-02-0685 RMW) (the “ERISA Action”), pending before Judge Whyte, involves ERISA
claims brought on behalf of the HBOC Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the “HBOC Plan”) and the
McKesson Profit Sharing and Investment Plan (the “McKesson Plan”), as well as participants in those
plans. On May 6, 2005, a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement was executed for that portion of
the ERISA Action that involves HBOC Plan claims. The proposed settlement resolves all claims by
the HBOC Plan and its participants in consideration of an $18.2 million cash payment by the
Company. The settlement is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, notice to
the class and final approval by the Court. Judge Whyte has scheduled a hearing on final approval
of the HBOC Plan settlement for September 9, 2005. The separate ERISA claims of the McKesson Plan
and its participants are not resolved by this settlement. The Company’s motion to dismiss those
claims remains pending before this Court.

State Actions

Twenty-four actions have been filed in various state courts in California, Colorado, Delaware,
Georgia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania (the “State Actions”). Like the Consolidated Action, the State
Actions generally allege misconduct by McKesson or HBOC (and others) in connection with the events
leading to McKesson’s decision to restate HBOC’s financial statements. Ten of those state court
actions remain pending in California and Georgia.

In the previously-reported actions pending in California Superior Court captioned

(Case No. CGC-02-405792) (“Merrill Lynch”), the trial court has set a
trial date of October 3, 2005. The Merrill Lynch plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment on
their common law fraud claim, and the hearing on that motion is presently set for July 1, 2005.

Five previously-reported actions remain pending in Georgia state courts:

Suffolk Partners
Limited Partnership et al. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Georgia State Court, Fulton County, Case
No. 00VS010469A);

Curran Partners, L.P. v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Georgia State Court, Fulton County, Case No. 02VS032502C.) The
allegations in these actions are substantially similar to those in the Consolidated Action. The
Company and HBOC have answered the complaints in each of these actions, generally denying the
allegations and any liability to plaintiffs. The

action has been stayed until
final disposition of the Consolidated Action. No trial date has been set for any of these actions.

As a result of the Company’s various pretrial motions, only a single post-merger accounting
oversight claim against the directors of post-merger McKesson remains to be litigated in the
previously-reported action captioned:

Saito, et. al. v. McCall

(Civil Action No. 17132.) The
Company filed its answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint in

Saito

on February 8, 2005. The parties
are currently engaged in discovery. No trial date has been set.

On March 30, 2004, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California
filed a three count indictment against former McKesson Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Richard H. Hawkins, charging him with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud,
securities fraud, and making false statements to an accountant. On March 31, 2004, Hawkins pled
not guilty to the charges. The Hawkins court trial closed on March 11, 2005. No verdict has yet
been issued.

During the third quarter of 2005, we also established a reserve of $240 million, which the
Company believes will be adequate to address its remaining potential exposure with respect to all
other previously reported Accounting Litigation, including the State Actions discussed above. That
sum includes the proposed $18.2 million settlement amount in the HBOC Plan ERISA Action noted
above. However, in view of the number of remaining cases, the uncertainties of the timing and
outcome of this type of litigation, and the substantial amounts involved, it is possible that the
ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve. The range of possible
resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments against the Company or settlements that
could require payments by the Company in addition to the reserve, which could have a material
adverse impact on McKesson’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

II. Other Litigations and Claims

In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject
to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for product liability and other
damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out
of the normal conduct of our business. These include:

Product Liability Litigation and Other Claims

Our subsidiary, McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., is one of multiple defendants in approximately
11 cases in which plaintiffs claim they were injured due to exposure, over many years, to latex
proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of
distributors, including McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc. Efforts to resolve tenders of defense to
its suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers.

We, along with more than 100 other companies, have been named in a lawsuit brought in 2000 by
the Lemelson Medical, Educational & Research Foundation (the “Foundation”) alleging that we and our
subsidiaries are infringing seven (7) U.S. patents relating to common bar code scanning technology
and its use for the automated management and control of product inventory, warehousing,
distribution and point-of-sale transactions. Due to the pendency of earlier litigation brought
against the Foundation by the manufacturers of bar code devices attacking the validity of the
patents at issue, the court stayed the suit against the Company until the conclusion of the earlier
case, including any appeals that may be taken. The trial in this earlier case concluded in January
2003 and the court subsequently ruled that each of the patents at issue was unenforceable due to
prosecutorial laches. The case is now on appeal to
the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. It is anticipated that oral argument will not occur
before May of 2005. While the suit against the Company was stayed, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office granted petitions for reexamination of 3 of the 7 patents asserted by the Foundation against
the Company. The reexamination will determine, among other things, whether these patents have
expired. Each of the remaining 4 patents in the action has already expired by its own terms, or by
the Foundation’s disclaiming the remaining portion of the patent’s life.

The Company is a defendant in approximately 110 California cases alleging that the plaintiffs
were injured by Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory drug manufactured by Merck & Company (“Merck”). The
cases typically assert causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty and
false advertising for improper design, testing, manufacturing, and warnings relating to the
manufacture and distribution of Vioxx. None of the cases involving the



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Company is scheduled for
trial. The Company has tendered each of these cases to Merck and has reached an agreement with
Merck to defend and indemnify the Company.

The Company is a defendant in approximately 42 cases alleging that the plaintiffs were injured
because they took the drugs known as fen-phen, the term commonly used to describe the weight-loss
combination of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with phentermine. The Company has been named as a
defendant along with several other defendants in 41 cases; and has accepted the tender of one of
its customers named as defendant in the one remaining case. The cases are pending in state courts
in California and Mississippi and in state and federal courts in Florida and New York, and
typically assert causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, false
advertising and unfair business practices for improper design, testing, manufacturing and warnings
relating to the distribution and/or prescription of fen-phen. The Company has tendered each of
these cases to its suppliers and has reached an agreement with its major supplier to defend and
indemnify the Company and its customers.

We, through our former McKesson Chemical Company division, are named in approximately 200
cases involving the alleged distribution of asbestos. These cases typically involve either single
or multiple plaintiffs claiming personal injuries and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages
as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement
signed at the time of the 1986 sale of McKesson Chemical Company to what is now called Univar USA
Inc. (“Univar”), we have tendered each of these actions to Univar. Univar has raised questions
concerning the extent of its obligations under the indemnification agreement, and while Univar
continues to defend us in many of these cases, it has been rejecting our tenders of new cases since
February 2005. We believe Univar remains obligated for all tendered cases under the terms of the
indemnification agreement, however we are beginning to incur defense costs in connection with these
more recently-served actions. We also believe that a portion of the claims against us will be
covered by insurance, and we are pursuing the available coverage.

On May 3, 2004, judgment was entered against the Company and one of its employees in the
action

Roby v. McKesson HBOC, Inc. et al.

(Superior Court of Yolo County, California, Case No.
CV01-573.) Former employee Charlene Roby brought claims for wrongful termination, disability
discrimination and disability-based harassment against the Company and a claim for disability-based
harassment against her former supervisor. The jury awarded Roby compensatory damages in the amount
of $3.5 million against the Company and $0.5 million against her supervisor, and punitive damages
in the amount of $15.0 million against the Company and a nominal amount against her supervisor.
Following post-trial motions, the trial court reduced the amount of compensatory damages against
the Company to $2.8 million; the punitive damages awarded against both defendants and the
compensatory damages awarded against the individual employee defendant were not reduced. On
October 18, 2004, the trial court awarded Roby her attorney’s fees in the amount of $0.7 million.
The Company has filed a Notice of Appeal, seeking reduction or reversal of the compensatory and
punitive damage awards and the award of attorney’s fees. If these efforts are not successful, the
judgment in this case could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the Company received a request for documents from the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) that asks the Company to voluntarily produce certain documents to the FTC. The
document request, which does not allege wrongdoing, is part of an FTC non-public investigation to
determine whether the Company, in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, may
have engaged, or may be engaging, in anti-competitive practices with other wholesale pharmaceutical
distributors in order to limit competition for provider customers seeking distribution services.
The investigation is at an early stage, and the Company is in the process of responding to the FTC
document request.

In April 2005, we received a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General of the State of
New York (“NYAG”) requesting the production of documents, responses to interrogatories and other
information concerning our participation in the secondary or “alternate source” market for
pharmaceutical products. This investigation appears to be in its early stages; and we are
cooperating with the NYAG and intend to be fully responsive to the subpoena.



McKESSON CORPORATION

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

Environmental Matters

Primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses, which were fully
divested by 1987, we are involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations. We have received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to
investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged
to exist at six sites where we, or entities acquired by us, formerly conducted operations; and we,
by administrative order or otherwise, have agreed to take certain actions at those sites, including
soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, we are one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United States Environmental
Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages (“NRD”) associated with
one of these six sites. Although the Company’s potential allocation under either directive cannot
be determined at this time, we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) group in the funding of an NRD assessment, the costs of which are reflected in the
aggregate estimates set forth below.

Based on a determination by our environmental staff, in consultation with outside
environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of reasonably possible remediation
costs for these six sites is $11.5 million, net of approximately $2 million that third parties have
agreed to pay in settlement or we expect, based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions
which are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties. The $11.5 million is expected to be paid
out between April 2005 and March of 2028. Our estimated liability for these environmental matters
has been accrued in the accompanying balance sheets.

In addition, we have been designated as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law or its state law
equivalent) for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of
hazardous substances at 28 sites. With respect to each of these sites, numerous other PRPs have
similarly been designated and, while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and
several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with
other PRPs. Our estimated liability at those 28 sites is approximately $2 million. The aggregate
settlements and costs paid by us in Superfund matters to date have not been significant. The
accompanying consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability.

The potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors
as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs; the complexity and evolving
nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations; the timing, varying costs
and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies; the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other PRPs; and the extent, if any, to which such costs are recoverable from
insurance or other parties.

While it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome or the duration of
any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this section II, “Other
Litigation and Claims”, we believe based on current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that,
except as otherwise noted, such litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

III. Contingency

In 2002, we entered into a $500 million, ten year contract with the National Health Services
Information Authority (“NHS”), an organization of the British government charged with the
responsibility of delivering healthcare in England and Wales. The contract engages the Company to
develop, implement and operate a human resources and payroll system at more than 600 NHS locations.

As previously reported, there have been contract delays to date which have increased costs and
decreased the amount of time in which we can earn revenues. These delays have adversely impacted
the contract’s projected profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this
contract. As of March 31, 2005, our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of
approximately $114 million in net assets, consisting of prepaid expenses, software and capital
assets, net of cash received, related to this contract. Due to the delays and other desired
modifications to the original contract, we have negotiated a tentative agreement with the NHS on
changes to certain key terms and conditions in the contract including a term extension and updated
implementation plan. We expect this contract amendment to be signed in the first quarter of the
2006 fiscal year. While we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate a satisfactory
system and recover our investment in this contract, failure to sign the tentative agreement in its
current form and/ or further implementation delays may result in significant losses that

FINANCIAL NOTES (Continued)

could be material. Additionally, if there is further modification to the tentative amended
contract terms and conditions and implementation plan, it is possible that the terms of that
agreement may result in significant losses, that could be material.

20. Stockholders’ Equity

Each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock is permitted one vote on proposals
presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the
Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”.)

In 2001, the Board approved a plan to repurchase up to $250.0 million of common stock of the
Company in open market or private transactions. In 2004 and 2003, we repurchased 3.9 million and
0.9 million shares for $115.1 million and $25.0 million. Since the inception of this plan, we
repurchased 8.3 million shares for $249.9 million. In 2004, the Board approved a new plan to
repurchase up to $250.0 million of additional common stock of the Company. Under this plan, we
have repurchased 1.4 million shares for $41.5 million in 2004. No common stock was repurchased
under either of the plans in 2005. The repurchased shares will be used to support the Company’s
stock-based employee compensation plans and for other general corporate purposes.

In 2005, the Board renewed the common stock rights plan. Under the renewal of the plan,
effective October 22, 2004, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one right (a “Right”) for
each outstanding share of Company common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase, upon
the occurrence of certain triggering events, a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Triggering events include, without limitation, the
acquisition by another entity of 15% or more of the Company’s common stock without the prior
approval of the Board. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects that will cause substantial
dilution to the ownership interest of a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on
terms not approved by the Board. The new Rights will expire in 2014, unless the date is extended
or the Rights are redeemed or exchanged earlier by the Board.

We have several equity compensation plans (stock option, restricted stock and stock purchase
plans) for the benefit of certain officers, directors and employees. As a result of acquisitions,
we also have 17 other option plans under which no further awards have been made since the date of
acquisition. Under the active equity compensation plans, we were authorized to grant up to 117.3
million shares as of March 31, 2005, of which 100.8 million shares have been granted.

The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) under which 11.1 million shares
have been authorized for issuance. Eligible employees may purchase a limited number of shares of
the Company’s common stock at a discount of up to 15% of the market value at certain plan-defined
dates. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, 1.9 million, 1.3 million and 1.5 million shares were issued under
the ESPP. At March 31, 2005, 3.1 million shares were available for issuance under the ESPP.

21. Related Party Balances and Transactions

Notes receivable outstanding from certain of our current and former officers and senior
managers totaled $44.9 million and $62.7 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004. These notes related
to purchases of common stock under our various employee stock purchase plans. The notes bear
interest at rates ranging from 2.7% to 8.0% and were due at various dates through February 2004.
Interest income on these notes is recognized only to the extent that cash is received. These
notes, which are included in other capital in the consolidated balance sheets, were issued for
amounts equal to the market value of the stock on the date of the purchase and are full recourse to
the borrower. At March 31, 2005, the value of the underlying stock collateral was $23.8 million.
The collectability of these notes is evaluated on an ongoing basis. As a result, in 2004, we
recorded a $21.0 million charge for notes from the former officers and employees. In 2005, we
reversed approximately $6 million of this reserve based on an increase in price of the underlying
stock collateral. Other receivable balances held with related parties, consisting of loans made to
certain officers and senior managers, at March 31, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $2.1 million and $2.6
million.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003 we incurred approximately $8 to $9 million annually of rental expense
from an equity-held investment. In addition, in 2005, 2004 and 2003 we purchased $3.0 million of
services per year from an equity-held investment.

22. Segments of Business

Our segments include Pharmaceutical Solutions, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Provider
Technologies. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on operating profit
before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued operations. Our Corporate
segment includes expenses associated with Corporate functions and projects, certain employee
benefits, and the results of certain joint venture investments. Corporate
