Industry Background

Competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide
variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation
while maintaining or reducing cost.  To
address these requirements, manufacturers often use integrated circuit-based
embedded control systems that enable them to:

•

differentiate
their products

•

replace
less efficient electromechanical control devices

•

reduce
the number of components in their system

•

add
product functionality

•

decrease
time to market for their products

•

significantly
reduce product cost


Embedded control systems have been incorporated into
thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and
markets worldwide, including:

Embedded control systems also facilitate the emergence
of new classes of products.  Embedded
control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal
active, and sometimes sole, component.  A
microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central
processing unit, non-volatile program memory, random access memory for data
storage and various input/output peripheral capabilities.  In addition to the microcontroller, a
complete embedded control system incorporates application-specific software and
may include specialized peripheral device controllers, non-volatile memory
components such as EEPROMs, and various analog and interface products.

The increasing demand for
embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger
segments of the semiconductor market. 
Microcontrollers are currently available in 4-bit through 32-bit
architectures.  4-bit microcontrollers
are relatively inexpensive, but they generally lack the minimum functionality
required in most applications and are typically used in relatively simple
applications.  8-bit microcontrollers
remain very cost-effective for a wide range of high volume embedded control
applications and, as a result, continue to represent the largest portion of the
overall microcontroller market.  16-bit
and 32-bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality, and
are generally found in more complex embedded control applications.

Most microcontrollers
shipped today are ROM-based and must be programmed by the semiconductor
supplier during manufacturing, resulting in 8-12-week lead times, based on
market conditions, for delivery of such microcontrollers.  In
addition to delayed product introduction, these long lead times can result in
potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes
in the firmware are required. To address these issues, some suppliers offer
programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the
customer’s manufacturing line, thus significantly reducing lead time and
inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur.  While these microcontrollers were initially
expensive relative to ROM-based microcontrollers, manufacturing technology has
evolved over time to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now
available for little to no premium over ROM-based microcontrollers, thus
providing significant value to microcontroller customers.  As a result, reprogrammable microcontrollers
are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller market.

Our Products

Our strategic focus is on
embedded control solutions, including:

•

microcontrollers

•

development tools

•

application-specific standard
products

•

analog and interface products

•

memory products

We provide highly
cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of
small size, high performance, low voltage/power operation and ease of
development, enabling timely and cost-effective embedded control product
integration by our customers.


Microcontrollers

We offer a broad family
of microcontroller products featuring a unique, proprietary architecture
marketed under the PIC

®

brand name. 
We believe that our PIC product family is a price/performance leader in
the worldwide microcontroller market.  We
have shipped over 4 billion PIC microcontrollers to customers worldwide since
their introduction in 1990.  Our PIC
products are designed for applications requiring field-programmability, high
performance, low power and cost effectiveness. 
They feature a variety of memory technology configurations, low voltage
and power, small footprint and ease of use. 
Our performance results from a product architecture which features dual
data and instruction pathways, referred to as a Harvard dual-bus architecture; a
Reduced Instruction Set Computer, referred to as RISC; and variable length
instructions; all of which provide significant speed advantages over
alternative single-bus, Complex Instruction Set Computer architectures,
referred to as CISC.  With almost 350 microcontrollers in our product
portfolio, we target the 8-bit and 16-bit microcontroller markets.  Additionally, our scalable product
architecture allows us to successfully target both the entry-level of the
32-bit microcontroller market, as well as the 4-bit microcontroller
marketplace, significantly enlarging our addressable market.

Digital Signal Controllers (DSC) are a subset of our
16-bit Microcontroller offering.  Our
dsPIC

®

Digital Signal
Controller families integrate the control features of high-performance 16-bit
microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of Digital Signal Processors
(DSPs), along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable
for a large number of embedded control applications.  Our dsPIC product family offers a broad suite
of hardware and software development tools, software application libraries,
development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer
application development cycle.  With its
field-re-programmability, large selection of peripheral functions, small
footprint and ease of use, we believe that our dsPIC Digital Signal Controllers
enlarge our addressable market.

We have used our
manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional
enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production
of our PIC family of microcontroller products. 
Our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced,
low cost user programmability feature by incorporating non-volatile memory, such
as Flash, EEPROM and EPROM Memory, into the microcontroller, and to be a leader
in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings.

Development Tools

We offer a comprehensive
set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development tools.  These tools enable system designers to
quickly and easily program a PIC microcontroller and dsPIC Digital Signal
Controllers for specific applications and, we believe are a key factor for
obtaining design wins.

Our family of development
tools operates in the standard Windows

®

environment on standard PC
hardware.  These tools range from
entry-level systems, which include an assembler and programmer or in-circuit
debugging hardware, to fully configured systems that provide in-circuit emulation
hardware.  Customers moving from
entry-level designs to those requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve
their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future PIC devices
since all of our systems share the same integrated development environment.

Many independent
companies also develop and market application development tools that support
our standard microcontroller product architecture.  Currently, there are more than 150
third-party tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary
microcontroller architecture.

We believe that
familiarity with and adoption of both our and third-party development tools by
an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the
future selection of our embedded control products.  These development tools allow design
engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our
standard microcontrollers.  To date, we
have shipped more than 430,000 development tools.

ASSPs

Our application-specific
standard products, referred to as ASSPs, are specialized products designed to
perform specific end-user applications, compared to our other products that are
more general purpose in nature.  Our ASSP
device families currently include, among others, our KEELOQ family of
secure data transmission products.


Analog
and Interface Products

Our analog and interface
products now consist of several families with over 450 power management,
linear, mixed-signal, thermal management and interface products.  At the end of fiscal 2006, our mixed-signal
analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 10,000 end
customers.

We continue marketing and
selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller
customer base, which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy, as well as to
new customers.  In addition to our “attach”
strategy, we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional
PIC microcontroller and memory products customer base.  We market these, and all of our products,
based on an application segment approach targeted, to provide customers with application
solutions.

Memory
Products

Our memory products
consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only
memory, referred to as Serial EEPROMs. 
We sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market, and we
are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide.  Serial EEPROM products are used for
non-volatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either
modified frequently or retained for long periods.  Serial EEPROMs have a very low I/O pin
requirement, permitting production of very small devices.

We address customer
requirements by offering products with extremely small package sizes and very
low operating voltages for both read and write functions.  Our memory products also feature long data
retention and high erase/write endurance.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and
assembly and test.  The ownership of our
manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy,
enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us
being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning our wafer fabrication facilities
and much of our assembly and test operations, and by employing proprietary
statistical process control techniques, we have been able to achieve and
maintain high production yields.  Direct
control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and
production cycles.  This control also
allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and
testing profit margin.

Our manufacturing
facilities are located in:

•

Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2)

•

Chandler, Arizona (probe operations)

•

Puyallup, Washington (Fab 3)
(non-operational)

•

Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4)

•

Bangkok, Thailand (assembly, probe
and test)

Wafer Fabrication

Fab 2 currently produces
8-inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 0.35 to 5.0
microns.  During fiscal 2006, Fab 2
operated at approximately 98% of its capacity compared to approximately 96%
during fiscal 2005.  Operating at higher
percentages of capacity has a positive impact on our operating results due to
the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing.

Fab 3 is currently non-operational and being
held-for-future-use.  See “

Item 6 - Selected Financial Data - Fiscal 2003 - Fab 3 Impairment Charge

,”
below at page 22, for a discussion of the status of Fab 3.

We acquired Fab 4 in August 2002 and began production
on October 31, 2003.  At March 31, 2006,
Fab 4 produced 8-inch wafers using predominantly 0.5 micron manufacturing
processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 0.18 microns.  A significant amount of clean room capacity
and equipment acquired with Fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to
support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs.  We believe the combined capacity of Fab 2, Fab 4  and Fab 3 will provide sufficient
capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand.


We continue to transition
products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing
costs.  We believe that our ability to
successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for
us to remain competitive.

We outsource a small percentage
of our wafer production requirements to third-party wafer foundries to augment
our internal manufacturing capabilities.

Assembly and Test

We perform product
assembly and testing at our facilities located near Bangkok, Thailand.  At March 31, 2006, approximately 66% of our
assembly requirements were being performed in our Thailand facility.  As of March 31, 2006, our Thailand facility
was testing substantially all of our wafer production.  We use third-party assembly and test
contractors in several Asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test
requirements.

General Matters
Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations

We employ proprietary
design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory
products.  We believe our processes
afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater
functionality in new product designs. 
While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes
for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology
for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products.  This allows us to more fully absorb our
process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market
more rapidly.  Our engineers utilize
advanced Computer Aided Design tools and software to perform circuit design,
simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication
facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test
wafers quickly and efficiently.

Due to the high fixed
costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high manufacturing
yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall
operating results.  Our continuous focus
on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent
manufacturing yields at our facilities. 
Our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation
of statistical process control, extensive employee training and selective
upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment.  Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and
yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results.  The manufacture and assembly of integrated
circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices,
such as those that we produce, are complex processes.  These processes are sensitive to a wide
variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing
environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer
fabrication personnel and equipment.  As
is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced
lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. 
Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at
approximately the current levels.

At the end of fiscal 2006, we owned long-lived assets
(consisting of property, plant and equipment and goodwill) in the United States
amounting to $576.9 million and $124.5 million in other countries,
including $118.0 million in Thailand.  At
the end of fiscal 2005, we owned long-lived assets in the United States
amounting to $628.0 million and $106.4 million in other countries,
including $100.6 million in Thailand.

Research and Development (R&D)

We are committed to
continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development
systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are significant
factors in maintaining our competitive position.  Our current R&D activities focus on the
design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, ASSPs, Serial
EEPROM memory, analog and interface products, new development systems, software
and application-specific software libraries. 
We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve
further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products.

In fiscal 2006, our
R&D expenses were $94.9

million,
compared to $93.0

million in fiscal 2005 and $85.4
million in fiscal 2004.


Sales and Distribution

General

We market our products
worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and
distributors.

Our direct sales force
focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets:
the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We
currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas
in North America, Europe and Asia.  We
believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued
development of the embedded control market. 
The majority of our field sales engineers (FSEs), field application
engineers (FAEs), and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds
and have been previously employed in high technology environments.  We believe that the technical knowledge of
our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our
products.  The primary mission of our FAE
team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic
training sessions for the balance of our sales team.  FAEs also frequently conduct technical
seminars and workshops in major cities around the world.

Distribution

Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the
product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors can provide an
effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.  We believe that customers recognize Microchip
for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply
channel.  During fiscal 2006 and fiscal
2005, we added significant resources to our internal sales force to provide
technical sales support for our customers in both the OEM and distribution
channels.  We believe that some of our
distribution partners have limited internal resources to support the technical
sales activities associated with selling our products, and we have added our
own employees to support these activities.

In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we derived 65% of our
net sales from sales through distributors and 35% of our net sales from
customers serviced directly by Microchip. 
Distributors accounted for 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2004.  Our largest distributor accounted for
approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 13% of our
net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. 
Our second largest distributor accounted for approximately 11% of our
net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2005
and fiscal 2004.  No other distributor or
end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2006, 2005
or 2004.

Distributors generally have broad-based rights to
return product to us.  As revenue on
distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product
to their end customers, distributor returns have no impact on our revenue.

We also grant certain credits to our
distributors.  The credits are granted to
the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’
business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our
products to their end customers.  The
credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they
provide information regarding the sale to their end customer.  The effect of granting these credits
establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products
and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the
distributors to their end customers.

We also provide these distributors with price
protection by reducing product pricing based on market conditions, competitive
considerations and other factors.  Price
protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand
at the date the price protection is offered. 
When we reduce the selling price of our products, it allows the
distributors to claim a credit against their outstanding accounts receivable
balances based on the new price of the inventory they have on hand as of the
date of the price reduction.  There is no
revenue recognition impact from the price protection activity.

We do not offer material incentive programs to our
distributors.

We do not have long-term agreements with our
distributors and we, or our distributors, may each terminate our relationship
with little or no advanced notice.  The
loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our
distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could
result in an increase in inventory returns.


Sales by Geography

Sales by
geography for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (dollars in
thousands):

Sales
to customers in Asia have increased as a percentage of sales from fiscal 2004
to fiscal 2005 and from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006.  We attribute this to the fact that many of
our customers are transitioning their manufacturing operations to Asia, as well
as to the growth in the demand of customers in Asia.

Sales
to foreign customers accounted for approximately 74% of our net sales in fiscal
2006, 73% of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and 71% of our net sales in fiscal
2004.  Our sales to foreign customers
have been predominately in Asia and Europe, which we attribute to the
manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive, communications,
computing, consumer and industrial control products.  Americas sales include sales to customers in
the United States, Canada, Central America and South America.

Sales
to customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 17% of
our net sales in fiscal 2006, approximately 16% of our net sales in fiscal 2005
and approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2004.  In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, sales to
customers in Taiwan accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales.  We did not have sales into any other foreign
countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Our
international sales are predominately U.S. dollar denominated.  Although foreign sales are subject to certain
government export restrictions, we have not experienced any material
difficulties as a result of export restrictions to date.

The
semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of
supply and demand.  Since a significant
portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales, our
business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth
quarters of our fiscal year.  However,
broad strength in our overall business in recent periods has had a more
significant impact on our results than seasonality, and has made it difficult
to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business.

Backlog

As of April 30, 2006 our
backlog was approximately $231.2 million, compared to $166.9 million as of
April 29, 2005.  Our backlog includes all
purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months.

We primarily produce
standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after
we receive an order.  Our business and,
to a large extent, that of the entire semiconductor industry, is characterized
by short-term orders and shipment schedules. 
Orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in
delivery schedules, or to cancellation at the customer’s option without
significant penalty.  Thus, while backlog
is useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not
be a reliable measure of sales for any future period.

Competition

The semiconductor
industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion
and rapid technological change.  We
compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of
which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical,
marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue
engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.  Furthermore, capacity in the semiconductor
industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or
improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position.


We currently compete
principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our
embedded control products, including the following product characteristics:

We believe that other important competitive factors in
the embedded control market include:

We believe that we compete favorably with other
companies on all of these factors, but we may be unable to compete successfully
in the future, which could harm our business.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

We maintain a portfolio of United States and foreign
patents, expiring on various dates between 2006 and 2024.  We also have numerous additional United
States and foreign patent applications pending. 
We do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have
a material impact on our business.  While
we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing
processes, we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the
technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our
ability to rapidly commercialize product developments, rather than on our
patents.  Our existing patents and any
new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to
provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us.  In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as
the laws of the United States.

We have entered into
certain intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with other companies
related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry,
we and our customers have from time to time received, and may in the future
receive, communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual
property rights on certain of our products or technologies.  We investigate all such notices and respond
as we believe is appropriate.  Based on
industry practice, we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary
licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms, but we cannot assure
that all licenses would be on acceptable terms, that litigation would not ensue
or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed.  Litigation, which could result in substantial
cost to us and require significant attention from management, may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, or to defend us
against claimed infringement of the rights of others.  The failure to obtain necessary licenses or
other rights, or litigation arising out of infringement claims, could harm our
business.

Environmental Regulation

We must comply with many
different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to
the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in
our manufacturing processes.  Our
facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe
that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations.  Any changes in
such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire
costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with
environmental regulations.  Any failure
by us to adequately control the storage, use and disposal of regulated
substances could result in future liabilities.

Increasing public
attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic
manufacturing operations.  While we have
not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from
environmental regulations, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of, or to
adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or
future environmental regulations.

Employees

As of April 30, 2006, we
had 4,336 employees.  None of our
employees are represented by a labor organization.  We have never had a work stoppage and believe
that our employee relations are good.

Item 1A.         RISK FACTORS

When evaluating Microchip and its business, you should
give careful consideration to the factors listed below, in addition to the
information provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other documents that we
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could
reduce our net sales and profitability

.

Our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide
variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability, many of
which are beyond our control.  Some of
the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

changes in demand or market acceptance of
our products and products of our customers

•

levels of inventories at our customers

•

the mix of inventory we hold and our
ability to satisfy orders from our inventory


•

changes in utilization of our
manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields

•

our ability to secure sufficient assembly
and testing capacity

•

availability of raw materials and
equipment

•

competitive developments including pricing
pressures

•

the level of orders that are received and
can be shipped in a quarter

•

the level of sell-through of our products
through distribution

•

changes or fluctuations in customer order
patterns and seasonality

•

constrained
availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability
to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those
customers

•

costs and outcomes of any tax audits or
any litigation involving intellectual property, customers or other issues

•

disruptions
in our business or our customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity, armed
conflict, war, worldwide oil prices and supply, public health concerns or
disruptions in the transportation system

•

property damage or other losses which are
not covered by insurance

•

general economic, industry or political
conditions in the United States or internationally

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our
operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely
upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance.  In future periods our operating results may
fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts
and investors, which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our
common stock.

Our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our
manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields.

The manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits,
particularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices such as those
that we produce, are complex processes. 
These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including
the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the
materials used, the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and
equipment, and other quality issues.  As
is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced
lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. 
Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at
approximately the current levels.  This
could include delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future
orders, and customer-imposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment
deadlines.

Our operating results are also adversely affected when
we operate at less than optimal capacity. 
Lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged
directly to expense and lower gross margins.

We are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same
quarter and therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments.

Our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a
combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for
shipment in that quarter, which we refer to as turns orders.  We measure turns orders at the beginning of a
quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set
entering the quarter.  Historically, we
have proven our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive
strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery
schedules.  Shorter lead times generally
mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in
any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product
shipments.  Turns orders correlate to
overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times.  Because turns orders are difficult to
predict, varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to
forecast.  If we do not achieve a
sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our
revenue targets, our revenue and operating results may suffer.

Intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing
pressures, reduced sales of our products or reduced market share.

The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive
and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological
change.  We compete with major domestic
and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market
recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing,
distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering,
manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.  Emerging companies are also increasing their
participation in the market for embedded control applications.  We may be unable to compete successfully in
the future, which could harm our business.


Our ability to compete successfully depends on a
number of factors both within and outside our control, including, but not
limited to:

•

the quality, performance, reliability,
features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of our products

•

our success in designing and manufacturing
new products including those implementing new technologies

•

the rate at which customers incorporate
our products into their own applications

•

product introductions by our competitors

•

the number, nature and success of our
competitors in a given market

•

our ability to obtain adequate supplies of
raw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices

•

our ability to protect our products and
processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights

•

the quality of our customer service and
our ability to address the needs of our customers, and

•

general market and economic conditions.

Historically, average selling prices in the
semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product.  The overall average selling prices of our
microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained
relatively constant, while average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM and
non-proprietary analog and interface products have declined over time.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary
product lines, due primarily to competitive conditions.  We have been able to moderate average selling
price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to
introduce new products with more features and higher prices.  We have experienced in the past and expect to
continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing
pressures in our Serial EEPROM products.

We may be unable to maintain average selling prices
for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which
could adversely impact our operating results.

Our business is dependent on selling through distributors.

Sales through distributors accounted for 65% of our
net sales in fiscal 2006, 65% of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and 64% of our
net sales in fiscal 2004.  Our two
largest distributors together accounted for approximately 25% of our net sales
in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. 
We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and both we
and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no
advanced notice.  We believe that
customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors
as an effective supply channel.

During fiscal 2006 we reduced the gross margin that
certain of our distributors earn when they sell our products.  We reduced these distributors’ gross margins
because we believe these distributors did not have sufficient technical sales
resources to properly address the marketplace for our products.  We have added a significant number of
technical sales employees throughout our worldwide sales organization to
address the support requirements for both our OEM and distribution customers.  We cannot predict the impact, if any, that
our actions will have on our relationships with such distributors.

The loss of, or a disruption in the operations of, one
or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given period and
could result in an increase in inventory returns.

Our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a
timely basis.

Our future operating results will depend on our
ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can
compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address
customer requirements.  The success of
our new product introductions depends on various factors, including, but not
limited to:

•

proper new product selection

•

timely completion and introduction of new
product designs

•

development
of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy
for engineers to understand and use, and

•

market acceptance of our customers’ end
products.

Because our products are complex, we have experienced
delays from time to time in completing development of new products.  In addition, our new products may not receive
or maintain substantial market acceptance. 
We may be unable to


design, develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis,
which could adversely impact our future operating results.

Our success also depends upon our ability to develop
and implement new design and process technologies.  Semiconductor design and process technologies
are subject to rapid technological change and require significant R&D
expenditures.  We and other companies in
the industry have, from time to time, experienced difficulties in effecting
transitions to advanced process technologies and, consequently, have suffered
reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries.  Our future operating results could be
adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is
substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented.

We must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and
competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market.

Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of
our senior management, engineering and other personnel.  The competition for qualified engineering and
management personnel is intense.  We may
be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and
retaining additional key personnel that we require.  The loss of the services of one or more of
our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our
business.  We have no employment
agreements with any member of our senior management team.

We are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing
functions for us.

We use several contractors located in Asia for a
portion of the assembly and testing of our products.  We also rely on outside wafer foundries for a
portion of our wafer fabrication. 
Although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources, the
disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and
operating results.

Our use of third parties involves some reduction in
our level of control over the portions of our business that we
subcontract.  Our future operating
results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial, operations
or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity, or if
they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and
costs at approximately their current levels, or if due to their locations in
foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure
disruption.  Further, procurement from
third parties is done by purchase order and contracts.  If these third parties are unable or
unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality
standards, we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for
our products in a timely manner or at all, and such arrangements, if any, may
not be on favorable terms to us.  In such
event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in
manufacturing and production costs, decline in product reliability, and our
business and operating results could be adversely affected.

We may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail
to meet our needs.

Our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw
materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards.  We generally have more than one source for
these supplies, but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of
delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards.  The raw materials and equipment necessary for
our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of
semiconductors in product applications increases.  We have experienced supply shortages from
time to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need
more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support
certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts.  An interruption of any raw materials or
equipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of
equipment, could harm our business.

Our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide
fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand.  Since a significant portion of our revenue is
from consumer markets and international sales, our business may be subject to
seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal
year.  However, broad strength in our
overall business in recent periods has had a more significant impact on our
results than seasonality, and has made it difficult to assess the impact of
seasonal factors on our business.  The
industry has also experienced significant economic downturns, characterized by
diminished product demand and production over-capacity.  We have sought to reduce our exposure to this
industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or
quickly replaced, to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad
range of market segments.  However, we
have experienced substantial period-to-period fluctuations


in operating results and expect, in the future, to experience
period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or
economic conditions.

We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims.

We are currently, and in the future may be, involved
in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual
property rights, contracts and other matters. 
We were involved in patent infringement litigation with Philips
Corporation which was settled in fiscal 2005. 
As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications
from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification
or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers
by third parties.  These legal
proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, could result in
substantial cost to us and divert our resources.  If we are not able to resolve a claim,
negotiate a settlement of a matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially
reasonable terms, reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement,
and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, we could incur uninsured
liability in any of them, be required to take an appropriate charge to
operations, be enjoined from selling a material portion of our product line or
using certain processes, suffer a reduction or elimination in value of
inventories,  and our business, financial
condition or results of operations could be harmed.

It is also possible that from time to time we may be
subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant
expenses related to the defense of such claims, increased costs associated with
the replacement of affected products, and a requirement to pay damages
claims.  Because the systems into which
our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we
sell, these expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and
profits the company received from the products involved.  While we specifically exclude consequential
damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such
liabilities may be limited by applicable law. 
We do have product liability insurance, but there is no certainty that
insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect
against such claims.  Costs or payments
we may make in connection with warranty or product liability claims may
adversely affect the results of our operations.

Further, we sell to customers in industries such as
automotive, aerospace, and medical, where failure of their systems could cause
damage to property or persons. We may be subject to product liability claims if
our products cause the system failures. Based on our historical experience, we
believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low.
However, we will face increased exposure to product liability claims if there
are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these
applications and the frequency of system failures caused by our devices.

Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in
lost revenue or market opportunities.

Our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other
intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes
is important for our success.  To that
end, we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to
continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes.  The process of seeking patent protection can
be long and expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending or
future applications.  In addition, our
existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient
scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage
to us.  We may be subject to or may
ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, which can require significant financial and management resources.  In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as
the laws of the United States. 
Infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could
result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us.

We do not typically have long-term contracts with our customers

.

We do not typically enter into long-term contracts
with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our
customers.  When we do enter into
customer contracts, the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of
the customer.  Even though we have over
50,000 end customers and our ten largest customers make up approximately 10% of
our total revenue, cancellation of long-term and short-term customer contracts
could have an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits.

Further, as the practice has become more commonplace
in the industry, we have entered into contracts with certain customers that
differ from our standard terms of sale. Under these contracts we commit to
supply quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates.  If we become unable to supply the customer as
required under the contract, the customer may incur additional production
costs, lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing
schedule, or quality related issues. Under these contracts, we may be liable
for the costs the customer has incurred. While we try to limit such
liabilities, if they should arise, there may be a material adverse impact on
our results of operation and financial condition.


Business interruptions could harm our business.

Operations at any of our manufacturing facilities, or
at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors, may be
disrupted for reasons beyond our control, including work stoppages, power loss,
incidents of terrorism or security risk, political instability, public health
issues, telecommunications, transportation or other infrastructure failure,
fire, earthquake, floods, or other natural disasters.  If operations at any of our facilities, or
our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted, we may not be able to shift
production to other facilities on a timely basis.  If this occurs, we would likely experience
delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for
production may be unavailable on acceptable terms.  This could result in reduced revenues and
profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers.  In addition, business interruption insurance
will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and
any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions
could significantly harm our business.

We are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations, which exposes us
to foreign political and economic risks.

Sales to foreign customers account for a substantial
portion of our net sales.  During fiscal
2006, approximately 74% of our net sales were made to foreign customers.  During fiscal 2005, approximately 73% of our
net sales were made to foreign customers. 
During fiscal 2004, approximately 71% of our net sales were made to
foreign customers.  We purchase a
substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign
suppliers.  In addition, we own product assembly
and testing facilities located near Bangkok, Thailand.  We also use various foreign contractors for a
portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication
requirements.  Substantially all of our
finished goods inventory is maintained in Thailand.

Our reliance on foreign operations, foreign suppliers,
maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign
locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and
economic risks, including, but not limited to:

•

political, social and economic instability

•

public health conditions

•

trade restrictions and changes in tariffs

•

import and export license requirements and
restrictions

•

difficulties in staffing and managing
international operations

•

employment regulations

•

disruptions in international transport or
delivery

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates

•

difficulties in collecting receivables

•

economic slowdown in the worldwide markets
served by us, and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

If any of these risks materialize, our sales could
decrease and our operating results could suffer.

Interruptions in information technology systems could affect our
business.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of
complex information technology systems and networks to operate our
business.  Any significant system or
network disruption, including but not limited to computer viruses, security
breach, and energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations,
sales and operating results.  We have
implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions, but such
disruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial results.  In addition, we may incur additional costs to
remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.

The occurrence of events
for which we are self-insured, or which exceed our insurance limits may affect our
profitability and liquidity.

We have insurance contracts with
independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk;
however, we self-insure for some risks and obligations.  In these circumstances, we have determined
that it is more cost effective to self-insure certain risks than to pay the
increased premium costs in place since the disruption in the insurance market
after the events of September 11, 2001. 
The risks and exposures that we self-insure include, but are not limited
to, product defects,


political risks, and patent infringement.  Should there be a loss or adverse judgment or
other decision in an area for which we are self-insured, then our financial
condition, result of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected.

We are subject to stringent environmental regulations, which may force
us to incur significant expenses.

We must comply with many different federal, state,
local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage,
discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used
in our manufacturing process.  Although
we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental
regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could
result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of
operations.  Any such environmental
regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other
significant expenses to comply with such regulations.  Any failure by us to control the use of or
adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to
future liabilities.  Environmental
problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities.

Further, certain of our customers shipping their
products into European markets are also subject to governmental environmental
regulations such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and
Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) which will be effective July 1,
2006.  These directives focus on limiting
the amounts of certain elements, such as lead, in electrical devices.  The inability of this sub-set of our
customers to use Microchip products which contain lead after July 2006 may
adversely affect our results of operations.

Compliance with future changes to securities
laws and related regulations could result in increased costs to us.

Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public
companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules
enacted and proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), The NASDAQ
Stock Market

®

(NASDAQ) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
resulted in significantly increased costs to us in fiscal 2005 as we responded
to their requirements.  In particular,
complying with the internal control audit requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley
Section 404 in fiscal 2005 resulted in increased internal efforts and
significantly higher fees from our independent accounting firm.  In fiscal 2006, our costs associated with
these activities were at approximately the same levels as in fiscal 2005.  Further changes in applicable legal or
accounting requirements could result in additional costs in future periods.

This report on Form 10-K contains a report by our
management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2006.  This Form 10-K also
contains an attestation and report by our auditors with respect to our
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting under Section 404.  While these
assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, compliance with Section 404 is an ongoing
process and will be required for each future fiscal year.  We expect that the ongoing compliance with
Section 404 will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there
can be no assurance that material weaknesses with not be identified in future
periods.  Any adverse results from such
ongoing compliance efforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our
financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Recent regulations related to equity compensation will adversely affect
our earnings and our ability to attract and retain key personnel.

Since our inception, we have used stock options and
other long-term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee
compensation packages and have accounted for them using the intrinsic value
method of APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”  We believe that stock options and other
long-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize
long-term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage
employees to remain with Microchip.  In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payments,” (“SFAS 123R”) which changed U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles in such a way to require us to record a charge to earnings for the
fair value of employee stock option grants and other share based compensation
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 
This regulation will negatively impact our earnings for those share
based awards that vest beginning in fiscal 2007.  Furthermore, adoption of SFAS 123R will
require us to make certain assumptions and judgments in the valuation of stock
options that we may grant in the future.  A change in any of those assumptions or
judgments could change the compensation expense that is charged against our
earnings and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations.  See also Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements – Significant Accounting Policies: 
Share-Based Payment.


In addition, recent regulations implemented by NASDAQ
requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans as well as recent
regulations implemented by NYSE prohibiting NYSE member organizations from
giving a proxy to vote on equity-compensation plans unless the beneficial owner
of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us
to grant equity-based awards to employees in the future.  To the extent that these or other new
regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees,
we may incur compensation costs, productivity losses, change our equity
compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate
employees, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to a variety of factors.

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated
significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future.  The future trading price of our common stock
could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many
of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:

•

quarterly variations in our operating
results and the operating results of other technology companies

•

actual or anticipated announcements of
technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors

•

changes in analysts’ estimates of our
financial performance or buy/sell recommendations

•

changes in our financial guidance or our
failure to meet such guidance

•

general conditions in the semiconductor
industry, and

•

worldwide economic and financial
conditions.

In addition, the stock market has experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices
for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the
operating performance of such companies. 
These broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market
price of our common stock.

The
outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns
by the IRS could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are subject to continued examination of our income
tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We
regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There
can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will
not have an adverse effect on future operating results.

In
the event we make acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate
such acquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits.

While acquisitions do not represent a major part of
our growth strategy, from time to time we may consider financially attractive
and strategic acquisitions if such opportunities arise. Any transactions that
we complete may involve a number of risks, including:  the diversion of our management’s attention
from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the
acquired or combined business or joint venture, or possible adverse effects on
our operating results during the integration process.  In addition, we may not be able to
successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly
acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform
standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational
inefficiencies.

Item 1B.         UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

Item 2.            PROPERTIES

At March 31, 2006, we owned the facilities described
below:


(1)

On June 30, 2003, we
completed closure of Fab 1 on our Chandler campus, and integrated certain of
the personnel and processes into Fab 2.

(2)

Currently non-operational
and being held-for-future-use.  Fab 3
consists of manufacturing buildings and land, with no equipment.

(3)

Located in the
Alphatechnopolis Industrial Park near Bangkok on land to which we expect to
acquire title in accordance with our agreement with the landowner.  Progress towards obtaining full title of the
land has been delayed due to a bankruptcy relating to the seller of the
land.  At this time it is not possible to
estimate when, or if, full title transfer will be completed.  We have provided reserves that we estimate
will be adequate to obtain full title. 
Such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land.

In addition to the facilities we own,
we lease several research and development facilities and sales offices in North
America, Europe and Asia.

Our
aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately
$0.4 million.

We currently believe that our existing facilities will
be adequate to meet our production requirements for the next 12 months.

Item 3.            LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of
our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as
plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more
of them.  Although the outcome of these
actions is not presently determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution
of these matters will not harm our business and will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of
operations.  Litigation relating to the
semiconductor industry is not uncommon, and we are, and from time to time have
been, subject to such litigation.  No
assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such
litigation in the future.

below, for a discussion of this change.


Fiscal 2003

Fab 3 Impairment Charge

During the September 2002 quarter, we recorded a $41.5 million asset
impairment charge as described below.

During July 2000, we acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in
Puyallup, Washington, referred to as Fab 3. 
The original purchase consisted of semiconductor manufacturing
facilities and real property.  It was our
intention to bring Fab 3 to productive readiness and commence volume production
of 8-inch wafers using its 0.7 and 0.5 micron process technologies by August
2001.  Due to deteriorating business
conditions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal 2002, we delayed the
intended production start up of Fab 3. 
Fab 3 has never been brought to productive readiness.

In August 2002 we acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in
Gresham, Oregon, referred to as Fab 4. 
After the acquisition of Fab 4 was completed, we undertook an analysis
of the potential production capacity at Fab 4. 
The results of the production capacity analysis at that time led us to
determine that Fab 3’s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future
and during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we committed to a plan to sell Fab
3.  Subsequently, we retained a
third-party broker to market Fab 3 on our behalf and began actively seeking
potential buyers.  Accordingly, Fab 3 was
classified as an asset held-for-sale as of September 30, 2002 and maintained
that classification until March 31, 2005.

Management determined the value assigned to the Fab 3 assets through
various methods including assistance from a third-party appraisal.  The independent third party used the market
approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair
value of Fab 3.  The comparable sales
included eight properties, including our purchases of Fab 3 in July 2000 and
Fab 4 in August 2002.  Based on the
results of this appraisal, we recorded an asset impairment charge on Fab 3 of
$36.9 million, including estimated costs to sell.  The remaining value of $60.2 million was
classified as an asset held-for-sale and was included as a component of other
current assets until March 31, 2005.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we recorded an asset
impairment charge of $4.6 million to write-down certain excess manufacturing
equipment located at Fab 3 to its net realizable value of $0.2 million.  This manufacturing equipment became “excess”
as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of Fab 4.  The net realizable value for the excess
manufacturing equipment was determined based on management estimates.  Substantially all of the other manufacturing
equipment located at Fab 3 has been transferred to and will be used in our
other wafer fabrication facilities located in Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) and
Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).

At March 31, 2005, we changed the classification of Fab 3 from an asset
held-for-sale to an asset held-for-future-use. 
Fab 3 had been on the market for over two years, and we had not received
any acceptable offers on the facility. 
Over that period of time, our business had increased significantly and
over the next several years we will need to begin planning for future wafer
fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of Fab 4’s clean room capacity is
utilized.  We determined that the
appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing the Fab 3 facility
and hold it for its future use.  As a
result of this change in classification, we had to assess the fair value of the
Fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon
the change in classification from “held-for-sale” to “held-for-future-use” under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144.  We performed a discounted cash flow analysis
of the Fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the
fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique
for the asset.  The discounted cash flow
analysis confirmed the carrying value of the Fab 3 asset at March 31, 2005 was
not in excess of its fair value.  We
began to depreciate the Fab 3 asset in April 2005.

PowerSmart In-Process Research and Development
Charge

On
June 5, 2002, we completed the acquisition of PowerSmart, Inc. in which we
acquired all of PowerSmart’s outstanding capital stock and assumed certain
stock options for consideration of $54.0 million in cash plus other
acquisition-related costs of $1.2 million. 
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”

,

and accordingly, the results of PowerSmart’s operations are included in our
consolidated results from the date of the acquisition.  The acquisition was not considered
significant under the rules and regulations of the SEC (Rule 3-05 of Regulation
S-X).

The
purchase price was allocated among PowerSmart’s tangible and intangible assets,
in-process research and development and goodwill.  Management determined the value assigned to
the assets acquired through various methods including assistance from a
third-party appraisal.  An allocation of
$9.3 million of the purchase price was assigned to in-process research and
development and was written off at the date of the acquisition.  The amount paid in excess of the fair value
of the net tangible assets was allocated to separately identifiable intangible
assets based upon an independent valuation analysis.


An
allocation of $5.6 million of the purchase price was made to core technology
and other identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over an
estimated useful life of seven years.  An
allocation of approximately $32.3 million of the purchase price was made to
goodwill.  None of the goodwill is
deductible for tax purposes.  The
goodwill related to the PowerSmart acquisition was reduced by $0.4 million to $31.9
million in the year ended March 31, 2005 due to a favorable settlement of a
liability that was recorded as of the original acquisition date.

Introduction

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that
appear elsewhere in this document, as well as with other sections of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1 –

Business”;
“Item 6 –

Selected Financial Data”; and “Item 8 –

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

We begin our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) with a summary of
Microchip’s overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the
goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and
products.  This is followed by a
discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe
are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in
our reported financial results.  In the
next section, beginning at page 27, we discuss our Results of Operations for
fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, and for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal
2004.  We then provide an analysis of
changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial
commitments in sections titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Contractual
Obligations” and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.”

Strategy

Our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing
specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control
applications.  Our strategic focus is on
embedded control products, which include microcontrollers, high-performance
linear and mixed signal devices, power management and thermal management devices,
and complementary microperipheral products including interface devices, Serial
EEPROMs, and our patented KEELOQ security devices.  We provide highly cost-effective embedded
control products that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance,
low voltage/power operation and ease of development, enabling timely and
cost-effective embedded control product integration by our customers.

Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and
assembly and test.  The ownership of our
manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy,
enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us
being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning our wafer fabrication facilities
and much of our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical
process control techniques, we have been able to achieve and maintain high
production yields.  Direct control over
manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production
cycles.  This control also allows us to
capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit
margin.

We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in
developing our embedded control products. 
We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in
existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product
designs.  While many of our competitors
develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product
lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and
non-volatile memory products.  This
allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and
to deliver new products to market more rapidly. 
Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and
software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house
photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design
techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently.

We are committed to continuing our investment in new
and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and
manufacturing process technologies.  We
believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our
competitive position.  Our current
research and development activities focus on the design of new
microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, ASSPs, memory and mixed-signal
products, new development systems, software and application-specific software
libraries.  We are also developing new
design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and
performance improvements in existing products.

We market our products
worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and
distributors.  Our distributors focus
primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a
broad base of diverse customers.  We
believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide
an effective means of reaching this broad


and diverse customer
base.  Our direct sales force focuses
primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the
Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently
maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in North
America, Europe and Asia.  We believe
that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued
development of the embedded control market. 
Many of our field sales engineers (FSEs), field application engineers
(FAEs), and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously
employed in an engineering environment. 
We believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key
competitive advantage in the sale of our products.  The primary mission of our FAE team is to
provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic
training sessions for FSEs and distributor sales teams.  FAEs also frequently conduct technical
seminars in major cities around the world, and work closely with our
distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and
analysis of Microchip’s financial condition and results of operations is based
upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  We review the accounting
policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.  The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories,
income taxes, property plant and equipment, impairment of property, plant and
equipment and assets held for sale and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources.  Results may differ from
these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we
based our assumptions.  We review these
estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.  We also have other
policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy regarding
revenue recognition to OEMs; however, we do not believe these policies require
us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our
policies described below.

Revenue Recognition —
Distributors

Our distributors
worldwide have broad rights to return products and price protection rights, so
we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their
customers.  We reduce product pricing
through price protection based on market conditions, competitive considerations
and other factors.  Price protection is
granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the
price protection is offered.  When we
reduce the price of our products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit
against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of
the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue impact from the price
protections.  We also grant certain
credits to our distributors.  The credits
are granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the
distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the
sale of our products to their end customers. 
The credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor
until they provide documentation of the sale to their end customer.  The effect of granting these credits
establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the product
and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the
distributors to their end customers.  Upon
shipment, amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable,
inventory is relieved, and the sale and the gross margin are deferred and are
reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor
to their customers.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at
the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method.  We write down our inventory for estimated
obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference
between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be
required.  Inventory impairment charges
establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently
reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying
amounts are recoverable.  In estimating
our reserves for obsolescence, we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a
12-month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the
estimated 12-month demand.


Income Taxes

As part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate
our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  This process involves estimating our actual current
tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from
differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance
sheet.  We must then assess the
likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that
recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.  We have not provided for a valuation
allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred
tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income.  Should we determine that we would not be able
to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period
such determination was made.  At
March 31, 2006, our gross deferred tax asset was $78.5 million.

Various taxing authorities in the United States and
other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of
various tax structures employed by businesses. 
Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing
authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant
operations.  We are currently under audit
by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for our fiscal years
ended March 31, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. 
As part of this ongoing audit, the IRS has proposed certain adjustments
related to positions reflected on these returns.  The IRS has issued formal assessments for
these adjustments.  We do not agree with
these adjustments and are appealing these assessments.  We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are
probable.  We believe that we maintain
adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise
upon final resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the
appeals process with the IRS.  The IRS is
currently auditing our fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  We believe that we maintain adequate tax
reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and
other audits in the United States and other countries in which we do
business.  If such amounts ultimately
prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result
in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
necessary.  If such amounts ultimately
prove to be less than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would
be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined.

Property, Plant & Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost.  Major
renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are
expensed when incurred.  At March 31,
2006, the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled $660.0 million,
which represents 28.1% of our total assets. 
This carrying value reflects the application of our property and
equipment accounting policies, which incorporate estimates, assumptions and
judgments relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from
five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30 years on
buildings.

We began production activities at Fab 4 on October 31,
2003.  We began to depreciate the Fab 4
assets as they were placed in service for production purposes.  As of March 31, 2006, all of the buildings
and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the manufacturing
equipment that had been placed in service. 
All manufacturing equipment that was not being used in production
activities was maintained in projects in process and is not being depreciated
until it is placed into service since management believes there will be no
change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into productive
service.  The lives to be used for
depreciating this equipment at Fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the
assets are placed in service.  We do not
believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated
life or carrying values of the underlying assets.

On March 31, 2005, we changed the classification of
Fab 3 from an asset held-for-sale to an asset held-for-future-use.  Fab 3 had been on the market for over two
years, and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility.  Over that period of time, our business had
increased significantly and over the next several years we will need to begin
planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of Fab
4’s clean room capacity is utilized.  We
determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing
the Fab 3 facility and hold it for our future use.  As a result of this change in classification,
we had to assess the fair value of the Fab 3 asset to determine if any
additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification
from “held-for-sale” to “held-for-future-use” under SFAS No. 144.  We performed a discounted cash flow analysis
of the Fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the
fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique
for the asset.  The discounted cash flow
analysis confirmed the carrying value of the Fab 3 asset at March 31, 2005 was
not in excess of its fair value.  If
indicators of impairment for the Fab 3 assets arise in the future, we will
determine if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to
the assets in question are less than their carrying value.  If less, we would recognize an impairment
loss on the


excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair
values.  We began to depreciate the Fab 3
asset in April 2005.

The estimates,
assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and
equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations
regarding future industry conditions and operations.  The use of different estimates, assumptions
and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and
expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations, could result
in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations.

We do not currently hold title to the land on which
our Thailand facility resides.  The land
is subject to a bankruptcy relating to the seller of the land.  We have provided reserves that we estimate
will be adequate to obtain full title. 
Such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land.  However, timing of the resolution is
difficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change.

Impairment of Property, Plant and
Equipment

We
assess whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present.  If such indicators are present, we determine
whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the
assets in question is less than their carrying value.  If less, we recognize an impairment loss
based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective
fair values.  Fair value is determined by
discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods.  If the assets determined to be impaired are
to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our
operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows
attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value, which we
depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may incur
impairment losses, or additional losses on already impaired assets, in future
periods if factors influencing our estimates change.

Litigation

Our current estimated
range of liability related to pending litigation is based on the probable loss
of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss.  Recorded reserves were not significant at
March 31, 2006.

Because of the
uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range
of loss on the pending litigation, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate
of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  As additional information becomes available,
we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and
revise our estimates.  Revisions in our
estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of
operation and financial position.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain operational
data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated:

Net Sales

We
operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products.  We sell our products to distributors and
original equipment manufacturers, referred to as OEMs, in a broad range of
market segments, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and
generally require no collateral.

Our net sales of $927.9 million in fiscal 2006
increased by $81.0 million, or 9.6%, over fiscal 2005, and net sales of $846.9
million in fiscal 2005 increased by $147.6 million, or 21.1%, over fiscal
2004.  The increases in net sales in
fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004
resulted primarily from increased demand,


predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller and analog products.  Average selling prices for our products were
down approximately 4% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 and approximately 4% in
fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004.  The number
of units of our products sold was up approximately 14% in fiscal 2006 over
fiscal 2005 and approximately 26% in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004.  The average selling prices and the unit
volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall
semiconductor market conditions.  We
believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the
embedded control market over the last three fiscal years.  Key factors in achieving the amount of net
sales during the last three fiscal years include:

•

continued market
share gains

•

increasing
semiconductor content in our customers’ products

•

customers’
increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions

•

our new product
offerings that have increased our served available market

•

increasing
demand for our products

We recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment
to OEMs.  Under our shipping terms, legal
title passes to the customer upon shipment from Microchip.  We have no post shipment obligations.  Distributors worldwide generally have broad
rights to return products and price protection rights, so we defer revenue
recognition until the distributors sell the product to their customers.  Upon shipment, amounts billed to distributors
are included in accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, the sale is
deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the
product is sold by the distributors to their customers.

Sales by product line for the fiscal years ended March
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Microcontrollers

Our
microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net
sales.  Microcontrollers and associated
application development systems accounted for approximately 79.3% of our total
net sales in fiscal 2006, approximately 79.7% of our total net sales in fiscal
2005 and approximately 79.6% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004.

Net
sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 9.1% in fiscal
2006 compared to fiscal 2005, and increased approximately 21.2% in fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004.  The increases
in net sales were primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller
products in end markets, driven principally by market share gains and those
factors described above under “

Net Sales

” at
page 27.  The end markets that we serve
include the automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial
control markets.

Historically,
average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of
any particular product.  The overall
average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively
constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products.  We have experienced, and expect to continue
to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines,
primarily due to competitive conditions. 
We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able
to, moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product
lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices.  We may be unable to maintain average selling
prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing
pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Memory
Products

Sales
of our memory products accounted for approximately 13.5% of our total net sales
in fiscal 2006, approximately 13.6% of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 and
approximately 13.1% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004.


Net
sales of our memory products increased approximately 8.9% in fiscal 2006
compared to fiscal 2005, and increased approximately 25.6% in fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004, driven primarily by customer demand conditions within
the Serial EEPROM market, which products comprise substantially all of our
memory product net sales.

Serial
EEPROM product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature, with steep
price declines followed by periods of relative price stability, driven by
changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle.  We have experienced, and expect to continue
to experience, varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our Serial
EEPROM products.  We may be unable to
maintain the average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM products as a result
of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our
operating results.

Analog
and Interface Products

Sales
of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 7.2% of our
total net sales in fiscal 2006, 6.7% of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 and
approximately 7.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004.

Net
sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 16.6% in
fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and increased approximately 11.9% in fiscal
2005 compared to fiscal 2004.  The
increase in net sales of our analog and interface products in these periods
were driven primarily by new proprietary design wins, supply and demand
conditions within the market and our ability to gain market share.

Analog
and interface products can be proprietary or non-proprietary in nature.  Currently, we consider more than half of our
analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature, where prices are
relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our
microcontroller products.  The
non-proprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience
price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those
products.  We may be unable to maintain
the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of
increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our
operating results.  We anticipate the
proprietary portion of our analog and interface products will increase over
time.

Distribution

Distributors
accounted for 65% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, and 64% of
our net sales in fiscal 2004.

Our
largest distributor accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal
2006, and approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal
2004.  Our two largest distributors
together accounted for 25% of our net sales in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and
fiscal 2004.

Generally,
we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our
distributors, may terminate their relationships with us with little or no
advanced notice.  The loss of, or the
disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce
our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in
inventory returns.

At
March 31, 2006, distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 2.0
months of inventory of our products. 
Over the past three fiscal years, the months of inventory maintained by
our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 2.0 months and 2.5
months.  Thus, inventory levels at our
distributors are at the low end of the range we have experienced over the last
three years.  We do not believe that
inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net
sales, due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sell through for all
of our distributors.

Distributors
generally have broad-based rights to return product to us.  As revenue on distributor shipments is not
recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end customers,
distributor returns have no impact on revenue recognition.

We
also grant certain credits to our distributors and also offer these
distributors price protection.  The
credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of
the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on
the sale of our products to their end customers.  The credits are on a per unit basis and are
not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale
to their end customer.  The effect of
granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our
distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us
when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers.

We
reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions,
competitive considerations and other factors. 
Price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they
have on hand at the date the price protection is


offered.  When we reduce the selling price of our
products, it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding
accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on
hand as of the date of the price reduction. 
There is no revenue recognition impact from the price protection.

We
do not offer material incentive programs to our distributors.

Sales by Geography

Sales
by geography for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as
follows (dollars in thousands):

Our
sales to foreign customers have been predominately in Asia and Europe, which we
attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive,
communications, computing, consumer and industrial control products.  Americas sales include sales to customers in
the United States, Canada, Central America and South America.  Sales to customers in Asia have increased
during the last three fiscal years due to many of our customers transitioning
their manufacturing operations to Asia and growth in demand from the emerging
Asian market.

Sales
to foreign customers accounted for approximately 74% of our net sales in fiscal
2006, 73% of our net sales in fiscal 2005, and 71% of our net sales in fiscal
2004.  Substantially all of our foreign
sales are U.S. dollar denominated.

Sales
to customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 17% of
our net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and approximately 14% of our net
sales in fiscal 2004.  Sales to customers
in Taiwan accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and
fiscal 2005.  We did not have sales into
any other countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during the last three
fiscal years.

Gross Profit

Our gross profit was $550.9 million in fiscal 2006, $484.0
million in fiscal 2005 and $350.0 million in fiscal 2004.  Gross profit as a percent of sales was 59.4%
in fiscal 2006, 57.1% in fiscal 2005 and 50.0% in fiscal 2004.

The most significant factors affecting gross profit
percentage over the past three fiscal years were:

•

Improvements
in capacity utilization and product absorption, which positively affected gross
margin by $23.0 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, and by
$11.8 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.

•

$31.8
million in accelerated depreciation and other costs associated with the closure
of Fab 1, which negatively affected gross margin in fiscal 2004.

•

Changes
in period cost of sales in Fab 3 and Fab 4, our non-operational facilities at
certain times during the last three fiscal years, which impact gross
margin.  Period cost of sales amounted to
$5.6 million in fiscal 2006, $3.3 million

in fiscal 2005
and $18.1 million in fiscal 2004.

•

A
one-week unpaid shutdown negatively affecting gross profit by $1.7 million in
fiscal 2004.  The shutdown occurred in
the three months ended September 30, 2003 and had a negative impact on gross
profit due to the fact that certain fixed costs including depreciation,
utilities, property taxes and other ongoing costs continued when the factory
was shut down.  There were no shutdowns
in fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005.

Other factors that impacted gross profit percentage in
the periods covered by this report include:

•

continued
cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such
as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques

•

factors
impacting the average selling prices of our products


•

fluctuations
in the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and analog products and
related Serial EEPROM products, and

•

inventory
write-offs and the sale of inventory that was previously written off.

During
fiscal 2006, we operated at approximately 98% of our Fab 2 capacity, which
favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal 2005.  During fiscal 2005, we operated at
approximately 96% of our Fab 2 capacity, which favorably impacted gross margins
compared to fiscal 2004.  Our utilization
of Fab 4’s total capacity is at relatively low levels although we are utilizing
all of the installed equipment base.  We
expect to maintain the current level of capacity utilization at Fab 2 and Fab 4
during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

The
process technologies utilized impact our gross margins.  Fab 2 currently utilizes various
manufacturing process technologies, but predominantly utilizes our 0.5 to 1.0
micron processes.  At March 31, 2006, Fab
4 predominantly utilized our 0.5 micron process technology.  We continue to transition products to more
advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.  Since the closure of Fab 1 in June 2003, all
of our production has been on 8-inch wafers. 
The first quarter of fiscal 2004, approximately 80% of our production
was on 8-inch wafers.

Our
overall inventory levels were $115.0 million at March 31, 2006, compared to
$103.7 million at March 31, 2005 and $94.5 million at March 31, 2004.  We maintained 106 days of inventory on our
balance sheet at March 31, 2006 compared to 107 days of inventory at March 31,
2005 and 101 days at March 31, 2004.

We
anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by
the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog and interface and memory
products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a
particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption, capacity
utilization levels, particularly those at Fab 4, and competitive and
economic conditions.

At March 31, 2006, approximately 66% of our assembly
requirements were performed in our Thailand facility, compared to approximately
70% as of March 31, 2005 and approximately 71% at March 31, 2004.  Contractors located in Asia perform the
balance of our assembly operations. 
Substantially all of our test requirements were performed in our
Thailand facility over the last three fiscal years.  We believe that the assembly and test
operations performed at our Thailand facility provide us with significant cost
savings when compared to contractor assembly and test costs, as well as
increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process.

We
rely on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication
requirements.

Research and Development
(R&D)

R&D
expenses for fiscal 2006 were $94.9 million, or 10.2% of sales, compared to
$93.0 million, or 11.0% of sales, for fiscal 2005 and $85.4 million, or 12.2%
of sales, for fiscal 2004.  We are
committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development
systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are significant
factors in maintaining our competitive position.  We expense all R&D costs as
incurred.  R&D expenses include
expenditures for labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for
the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support
new products and design environments.

R&D
expenses increased $1.9 million, or 2.0%, for fiscal 2006 over fiscal
2005.  The primary reasons for the dollar
increase in R&D costs in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was higher
labor and recruitment costs as a result of expanding our technical resources
and increases in bonuses.  R&D
expenses increased $7.6 million, or 9.0%, for fiscal 2005 over fiscal
2004.  The primary reasons for the dollar
increase in R&D costs in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was higher
labor costs as a result of expanding our technical resources and increasing
bonuses.

Selling,
General and Administrative

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 were $129.6

million, or 14.0% of sales, compared to $111.2 million, or
13.1% of sales, for fiscal 2005, and $92.4 million, or 13.2% of sales, for
fiscal 2004.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales,
marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional
expenditures and legal expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related
to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales
offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection
and use of our products.


Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased $18.4

million,
or 16.5%, for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005. 
The primary reasons for the dollar increases in selling, general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 were higher labor costs
as a result of expanding our internal resources, increases in bonuses and
increases in travel expenses.  Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased $18.8 million, or 20.3%, for
fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004.  The
primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 were higher labor costs as a result of
expanding our internal resources, increases in bonuses, increases in travel
expenses and increases in audit and legal services.

Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate
over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Special Charges

The following table presents a summary of special
charges for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in
thousands).

There were no special charges in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2005

Settlement with U.S.
Philips Corporation

In fiscal 2005, we reached an agreement with U.S.
Philips Corporation and Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together
“Philips”) regarding patent license litigation between Philips and
ourselves.  The agreement included
dismissal of the then pending litigation and the cross-license of certain
patents between Philips and Microchip. 
We recorded a special charge of $21.1 million in the quarter ended June
30, 2004 associated with this matter.  As
part of the settlement, we licensed certain of our patents related to 8-pin
microcontrollers to Philips, and Philips licensed its patents related to I


C serial communications to us, each on fully-paid up,
non-royalty bearing worldwide licenses. 
The definitive agreement related to this matter was finalized and
executed, and we made a cash payment to Philips during our fiscal quarter
ending September 30, 2004.

Fiscal 2004

Fab 1 Closure and Special
Charges

On April 7, 2003, we announced our intention to close
our Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1) wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain
Fab 1 personnel and processes into our Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) wafer fabrication
facility.  We completed this integration
process during the three-month period ended June 30, 2003.  The closure of Fab 1 and the integration of
certain Fab 1 personnel into Fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force
of 207 employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing
operations or provided support to Fab 1. 
The detail of the charges incurred related to the closure of Fab 1 that
were included in cost of sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003
is as follows (amounts in thousands):


For the quarter ended June 30, 2003, operating expense
included $1,612,000 of special charges recorded principally for contract
cancellation, severance and other costs related to the closure of Fab 1 and
other actions.  We incurred $865,000 of
such expenditures during fiscal 2004.  We
reversed $747,000 of the special charges recorded in the quarter ended June 30,
2003 in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 as a result of a favorable outcome
in the settlement of a contract cancellation.

The facility where Fab 1 is located is an integral
part of our overall campus in Chandler, Arizona.  Within this same facility resides our wafer
probe, mask making and other manufacturing related activities.  The accelerated depreciation that was taken
only related to assets used in the wafer fabrication operations at the
facility.  The property, plant and
equipment that was subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the
gross and accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property, plant and
equipment section of our balance sheet and related footnote disclosures.

Other
Income (Expense)

Interest income in fiscal
2006 increased from interest income in fiscal 2005 as our average invested
balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, and we
earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances.  Interest income in fiscal 2005 increased from
interest income in fiscal 2004 as our average invested balances were at higher
levels in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, and we extended the average
maturity term of our invested balances and thus earned a higher interest rate
on our invested balances.

Provision
for Income Taxes

Provisions for income
taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our U.S.
earnings.  Our effective tax rate was
32.5% in fiscal 2006, 22.9% in fiscal 2005 and 22.8% in fiscal 2004, and is
lower than statutory rates in the United States due primarily to lower tax
rates at our foreign locations, R&D tax credits and export sales
incentives.  Our effective tax rate in
fiscal 2006 reflects a $30.6 million tax expense related to the repatriation of
$500 million of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (the
“Jobs Act”) that was effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 which
increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 by 8.5%.

Various taxing authorities in the United States and
other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of
various tax structures employed by businesses. 
Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing
authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant
operations.  We are currently under audit
by the IRS for our fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.  As part of this ongoing audit, the IRS has
proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these
returns.  The IRS has issued formal
assessments for these adjustments.  We do
not agree with these adjustments and are appealing these assessments.  We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are
probable.  We believe that we maintain
adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise
upon final resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the
appeals process with the IRS.  The IRS
recently began an audit of our fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  We believe that we maintain adequate tax
reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and
other audits in the United States and other countries in which we do business.  If such amounts ultimately prove to be
unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax
benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
necessary.  If such amounts ultimately
prove to be less than any final assessment, a future charge to expense would be
recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined.

Our Thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit
from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the Thailand
government based on our investments in property, plant and equipment in
Thailand.  Our tax holiday periods in
Thailand expire at various times beginning in September 2006.  We do not expect the future expiration of any
of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our overall
tax expense due to other tax holidays and an increase in income in other taxing
jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.


Liquidity and Capital
Resources

We had $1,285.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term and long-term investments at March 31, 2006, an increase of $550.5
million from the March 31, 2005 balance. The increase in cash, cash equivalents
and short-term and long-term investments over this time period is primarily
attributable to our cash flows generated from operations and, to a lesser
extent, from increases in short-term borrowings.

Net cash provided
from operating activities was $437.3 million for fiscal 2006, $352.7 million
for fiscal 2005 and $343.1 million for fiscal 2004. The increase in cash flow
from operations was primarily due to increases in net income and changes in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $136.6
million for fiscal 2006, $370.7 million for fiscal 2005 and
$267.6 million in fiscal 2004.  The
decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005
was primarily due to changes in our net purchases, sales and maturities of
investments.  The increase in cash used
in investing activities in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was due to changes in
our net purchases, sales and maturities of investments.

Our level of capital
expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated
business conditions.  Capital
expenditures were $76.3

million in
fiscal 2006, $63.2 million in fiscal 2005 and $63.5 million in fiscal
2004.  The primary reasons for the dollar
increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was to fund
capital expansion activities in our manufacturing operations.  We currently intend to spend approximately
$80 million during the next 12 months to invest in equipment and facilities to
maintain, and selectively increase, capacity to meet our currently anticipated
needs.

We expect to finance
capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from
operations.  We believe that the capital
expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide
sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs.

Net cash provided by financing
activities was $195.8 million for fiscal 2006. 
Net cash used in financing activities was $18.6

million
for fiscal 2005 and $24.0 million for fiscal 2004.  Proceeds from the sale of stock, the exercise
of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan
were $95.8 million for fiscal 2006, $47.2 million for fiscal 2005 and $53.2
million for fiscal 2004.  Cash expended
for the repurchase of our common stock was $3.3 million in fiscal 2006, $68.3
million in fiscal 2005 and $53.9 million in fiscal 2004.  We had short-term borrowings of $269.0
million at March 31, 2006 and $45.5 million at March 31, 2005.  The short-term borrowings of $269.0 million
at March 31, 2006 relate to transactions associated with the repatriation of
foreign earnings under the Jobs Act. 
During fiscal 2006, we paid down $45.5 million in short-term borrowings
and initiated new borrowings of $269.0 million. 
To complete the repatriation of $500 million, we initiated the $269.0
million in borrowings, which were collateralized against investments that are
held in the foreign locations, allowing the investments to reach their normal
maturity date.  We presently intend to
pay down the short-term borrowings as those investments mature and new cash is
generated in the foreign locations.  The
short-term debt is a result of repurchase agreements that are in place with two
investment firms.

On March 11, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions.  As of
March 31, 2006, we had repurchased the entire 2,500,000 common shares under
this authorization for a total of $66.1 million.  On April 22, 2004, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2,500,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As of March 31, 2006, we had repurchased
1,004,834 common shares under this authorization for a total of $26.6
million.  As of March 31, 2006, all of the
purchased shares under both authorizations had been reissued to fund stock
option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.  The timing and amount of any future
repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations.

On October 28, 2002, we announced that our Board of
Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common
stock.  The initial quarterly dividend of
$0.02 per share was paid on December 6, 2003 in the amount of $4.0 million.  We have continued to pay quarterly dividends
and have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular basis.  During fiscal 2004, we paid dividends in the
amount of $0.113

per share for a total dividend
payment of $23.3 million.  During fiscal
2005, we paid dividends in the amount of $0.208 per share for a total dividend
payment of $43.0 million.  During fiscal
2006, we paid dividends in the amount of $0.57 per share for a total dividend
payment of $120.1 million.  On April 25,
2006, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.215 per share, which was paid
on May 23, 2006, to stockholders of record on May 9, 2006 and the total amount
of such dividend was $46.0 million. 
Our Board is free to change its dividend practices at any time and to
decrease or increase the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend, on our common
stock on the


basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash
requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our
Board.  Our current intent is to provide
for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our
results of operations.

We enter into hedging transactions from time to time
in an attempt to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations.  Although none of the countries in which we
conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy
in the last five years, there is no assurance that inflation rates or
fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations
will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.  The hedging transactions outstanding at March
31, 2006 were immaterial.

We believe that our existing sources of liquidity
combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our
currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  However, the semiconductor industry is
capital intensive.  In order to remain
competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant
investments in capital equipment for both production and research and
development.  We may seek additional
equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer
fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, or for other
purposes.  The timing and amount of any
such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including
demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, and
competitive factors.  There can be no
assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, and any
additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to
our existing stockholders.

Contractual Obligations

The following table
summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March 31, 2006, and the
effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in
future periods.  This table excludes
amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at March
31, 2006 (dollars in thousands):

Purchase orders or
contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are
not included in the table above.  We are
not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that
represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent
authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  For the purpose of this table, contractual
obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that
are enforceable and legally binding on Microchip and that specify all
significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased;
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the
transaction.  Our purchase orders are
based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with
short time horizons.  We do not have
significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods
specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected
requirements for three months.  We also
enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under
these


contracts were not significant and the contracts
generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant
penalty.

The expected timing of
payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current
information.  Timing of payments and
actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods
or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of March 31,
2006, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 3(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements

During December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised
2004) (“SFAS No. 123R”),

Share-Based Payment,

a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and its
related implementation guidance.  The
Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity
obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123R requires a public entity
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions).  That cost will be
recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide
service in exchange for the award.  On
March 29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
(“SAB No. 107”), which provides the Staff’s views regarding interactions
between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides
interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies.

SFAS No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods:

(1) A “modified prospective” method in which compensation
cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after
the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS
No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective date.

(2) A “modified retrospective” method which includes the
requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also
permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under
SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior
periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption.

This statement is effective for the beginning of the
first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005.  Therefore, we will adopt the standard
effective April 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method.  As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we
currently account for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic
value method prescribed in APB No. 25 and, as such, generally recognize no
compensation cost for employee stock options. 
Although we have not completed our assessment, we believe the impact on
our consolidated financial position or results or operations will be material
given the current number of outstanding stock options.  The effect on our results of operations of
expensing stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton method is presented in
the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1. SFAS
No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather
than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature.  The standard also requires that tax benefits
must be realized through a reduction of income taxes that would otherwise have
been paid before the benefit can be recorded. 
This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and may increase
net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. We cannot estimate what
those amounts will be in the future because they depend on, among other things,
the form of equity compensation, the number of grants and when employees
exercise stock options.

Item 7A.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our investment
portfolio, consisting of fixed income securities and money market funds that we
hold on an available-for-sale basis, was $1,285.1 million as of March 31,
2006, and $728.7 million as of March 31, 2005. 
These securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest
rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase.  We have the ability to hold our fixed income
investments until maturity and, therefore, we would not expect to recognize any
material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates
increase.  The following table provides
information about our available-for-sale securities that are sensitive to
changes in interest rates.  We have
aggregated our available-for-sale securities for presentation purposes since
they are all very similar in nature (dollars in thousands):


We have
international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate
fluctuations.  To date, our exposure
related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant.  Approximately 99% of our sales are
denominated in U.S. dollars.  We maintain
hedges related to our foreign currency exposure of our net investment in a
foreign operation as needed.  There were

no hedges outstanding as
of March 31, 2005.  The amounts of the
hedges outstanding as of March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2004 were
immaterial.  If foreign currency rates
fluctuate by 15% from the rates at March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, the
effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be
material.

During the normal course of business we are routinely
subjected to a variety of market risks, examples of which include, but are not
limited to, interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations, as we
discuss in this Item 7A, and collectability of accounts receivable.  We continuously assess these risks and have
established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of
these and other potential exposures. 
Although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas,
no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these
areas in the future.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, as required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we evaluated under the
supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management. Our disclosure controls and procedures include
components of our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
but not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection


of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management assessed our internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, the end of our fiscal year.  Management based its assessment on criteria
established in Internal Control

—

Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.  Management’s assessment
included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness
of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting
policies, and our overall control environment. 
This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our
finance organization.

Based on our assessment, management has concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of
the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  We reviewed the results of
management’s assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst & Young LLP, who also audited the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, audited management’s assessment and independently assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  Ernst & Young LLP has issued their
attestation report, which is included in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

During the three months
ended March 31, 2006, there was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by
paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Attestation Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Microchip Technology Incorporated and
subsidiaries

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Microchip Technology
Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Microchip
Technology Incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that Microchip Technology Incorporated maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, Microchip Technology Incorporated maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2006, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the March 31, 2006 consolidated financial
statements of Microchip Technology Incorporated and our report dated May 17,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Microchip Technology Incorporated and
subsidiaries

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microchip Technology
Incorporated and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Microchip Technology
Incorporated and subsidiaries at March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Microchip Technology
Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated May 17, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of
Business

Microchip
develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products used by its
customers for a wide variety of embedded control applications. Microchip’s
product portfolio comprises 8- and 16-bit PIC® microcontrollers and 16-bit
dsPIC® digital signal controllers, which feature on-board Flash
(reprogrammable) memory technology. In addition, Microchip offers a broad
spectrum of high-performance linear, mixed-signal, power management, thermal
management, battery management and interface devices. Microchip also makes serial
EEPROMs and complementary microperipheral products. Microchip’s synergistic
product portfolio targets thousands of applications and a growing demand for
high-performance designs in the automotive, communications, computing, consumer
and industrial control markets.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microchip Technology Incorporated and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (“Microchip” or the “Company”). The Company does not have any
subsidiaries in which it does not own 100% of the outstanding stock. All of the
Company’s subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Revenue
Recognition

The Company recognizes
revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement
with the customer, transfer of title as well as fixed pricing and probable
collectability. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales to OEMs upon
shipment and records reserves for estimated customer returns. Distributors
worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights, so
the Company defers revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product
to their customer. The Company reduces product pricing through price protection
based on market conditions, competitive considerations and other factors. Price
protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand
at the date the price protection is offered. When the Company reduces the price
of its products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its
outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the
inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction. There is no
revenue impact from the price protections. The Company also grants certain
credits to its distributors. The credits are granted to the distributors on
specially identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn
a competitive gross margin on the sale of the Company’s products to their end
customers. The credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the
distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end
customer. The effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling
price from the Company to its distributors for the product and results in the
net revenue recognized by the Company when the product is sold by the
distributors to their end customers. Upon shipment, amounts billed to
distributors are included as accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, the
sale and the gross margin are deferred and reflected as a current liability
until the product is sold by the distributor to its customers. Shipping charges
billed to customers are included in net sales, and the related shipping costs
are included in cost of sales.

Product Warranty

The Company generally
sells products with a limited warranty related to product quality and a limited
indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims
related to the Company’s products. Due to comprehensive product testing, the
short time between product shipment and the detection and correction of product
failures, and a low historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the
accrual based on historical activity and the related expense were not
significant as of and for the fiscal years presented.

Advertising
Costs

The Company expenses all
advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were not material in the years
ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

F-6

Research
and Development

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include
expenditures for labor, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for development
of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and
design environments.

Foreign
Currency Translation and Forward Contracts

The
Company’s foreign subsidiaries are considered to be extensions of the U.S.
Company and any translation gains and losses related to these subsidiaries are
included in other income and expense. As the U.S. dollar is utilized as the
functional currency, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the
subsidiaries’ functional currency) are also included in income. Gains and
losses associated with currency rate changes on forward contracts are recorded
currently in income. These gains and losses are immaterial to the Company’s
financial statements.

Income
Taxes

As part of the process of
preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to
estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This
process involves estimating the Company’s actual current tax exposure together
with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of
items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are included within the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet. The Company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred
tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it
believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance. The
Company has not provided for a valuation allowance because management currently
believes that it is “more likely than not” that its deferred tax assets will be
recovered from future taxable income.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

All
highly liquid investments, including marketable securities purchased with a
remaining maturity of three months or less when acquired are considered to be
cash equivalents.

Short-term and Long-term Investments

The Company’s investments
are classified as available-for-sale. These investments consist of government
agency bonds, municipal bonds, state student loan bonds and floating rate
securities. The Company defines short-term investments as income yielding
securities which can be readily converted to cash and defines long-term investments
as income yielding securities with maturities of over one year that have
unrealized losses attributable to them. The Company has the ability to hold its
long-term investments until such time as these assets are no longer impaired. Such
recovery is not expected to occur within the next year. The Company’s
investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported
in stockholders’ equity. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over
the life of the related available-for-sale security. Dividend and interest
income are recognized when earned. The cost of securities sold is calculated
using the specific identification method.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments, which is included in bad
debt expense. The Company determines the adequacy of this allowance by
regularly reviewing the composition of its accounts receivable aging and evaluating
individual customer receivables, considering such customer’s financial
condition, credit history and current economic conditions.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at
the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. The Company
writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory
in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the
estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market
conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
by the Company, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventory
impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not
subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that
increased carrying amounts are recoverable. In estimating reserves for
obsolescence, the Company primarily evaluates estimates of demand over a
12-month period and provides reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the
estimated 12-month demand.

F-7

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are
capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. The
Company’s property and equipment accounting policies incorporate estimates,
assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of its property and
equipment. Depreciation is provided for assets placed in service on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relative assets,
which range from 3 to 30 years. The Company evaluates the carrying value of its
property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of such assets may be impaired. Asset impairment evaluations
are, by nature, highly subjective.

Litigation

The Company’s estimated
range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which
management believes a loss is probable and it can estimate the amount or range
of loss. Because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of
the loss on the pending litigation, the Company is unable to make a reasonable
estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome. As
additional information becomes available, the Company will assess the potential
liability related to its pending litigation and revise its estimates, if
necessary.

Goodwill

Goodwill is
recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated
fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. The
Company is required to perform an annual impairment review, and more frequently
under certain circumstances. The goodwill is subjected to this test during the
fourth quarter of the Company’s fiscal year. The Company engages primarily in
the design, development, manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products
and, as a result, the Company concluded there is one reporting unit. The
impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its
carrying value. If the Company determines through the impairment process that
goodwill has been impaired, the Company will record the impairment charge in
the statement of income. As of March 31, 2006, there was no impairment charge
related to goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The
Company assesses whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are
present. If such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum
of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question
is less than their carrying value. If less, the Company recognizes an
impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over
their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future
cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined to be
impaired are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss
through a charge to operating results to the extent the present value of
anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s
carrying value. The Company would depreciate the remaining value over the
remaining estimated useful life of the asset.

Share-Based
Compensation

The
Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to certain employees
and directors with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
shares at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB No. 25”), “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees” and related Interpretations, and, accordingly,
recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants.

The
Company has granted a limited number of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to its
employees. The intrinsic value of the RSUs is being recorded as compensation
expense over the vesting period of the RSUs. There is $5.7 million of deferred share-based
compensation on the Company’s balance sheet at March 31, 2006 representing the
future stock compensation expense to be recorded over the remaining vesting
period of the outstanding RSUs. The Company has decided to use RSUs as its
primary long-term equity incentive compensation instrument in the future.

The
following table represents the effect on net income and earnings per share
(shown in thousands, except for per share amounts) if the Company had applied
the fair value based method and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” to share-based employee and director
compensation. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the
options is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and
amortized ratably to expense over the options’ vesting periods. Because the
estimated value is determined as of the date of grant, the actual value
ultimately realized by the employee may be significantly different.

F-8

See Note 15 for further
discussion of the Company’s equity incentive plans.

At a meeting held on
February 17, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and the
Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of the vesting of
certain Company stock options with an option price of $27.153 per share or
greater. The purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to
avoid recognizing in its income statement compensation expense associated with
these options in future periods, upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment”  in April 2006. The pre-tax
charge that was avoided amounted to approximately $13.7 million and represented
the fair value of the unvested awards as of the date of the acceleration as
determined under SFAS No. 123. This amount would otherwise have been required
to be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period upon adoption
of SFAS No. 123R. As a result of the accelerated vesting, approximately 2.3
million option shares or 25.4% of the total number of the outstanding unvested
option shares as of the date of the acceleration with varying remaining vesting
schedules became immediately exercisable. In connection with the vesting
acceleration, the Company required that any shares received through the
exercise of the accelerated options not be sold by the option holder until the
first to occur of the original vesting date of the accelerated option or the
termination of the employment of the option holder. On April 25, 2006, in order
to alleviate administrative burdens, the Company waived this requirement as to
approximately 1.0 million option shares held by those employees who are not
executive officers, appointed officers or director-level employees of the
Company. As of the date of the acceleration, the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock was below the option price of the accelerated options in
all material respects, so no APB No. 25 charges were incurred and future
potential charges are immaterial.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of investments in debt securities and trade receivables. The Company
generally places its investments with high-credit quality counterparties. Investments
in debt securities with original maturities of greater than six months consist
primarily of AAA rated financial instruments and counterparties. The Company’s
investments are primarily in direct obligations of the United States government
or its agencies.

Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally not significant due to
the diversity of the Company’s customers and geographic sales areas. The
Company had two distributors that accounted for more than 10% of its net sales
in the year ended March 31, 2006. The Company sells its products primarily to
OEMs and distributors in the Americas, Europe and Asia. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and requires
collateral, primarily letters of credit, as deemed necessary. No single end
customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales or accounts
receivable balances during the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. See
Note 17, Geographic Information, for additional information on the Company’s
largest distributors.

Use of
Estimates

The Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated
financial

F-


statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 123 (Revised
2004) (“SFAS No. 123R”), “Share-Based Paymen

t

,” is a revision of SFAS No. 123
and supersedes APB No. 25 and its related implementation guidance. The
Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity
obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS
No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in
exchange for the award. On March 29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”), which provides the Staff’s views
regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and
regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based
payments for public companies.

SFAS No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods:

(1) A “modified prospective” method in which compensation
cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after
the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS
No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective date.

(2) A “modified retrospective” method which includes the
requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also
permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under
SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all
prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of
adoption.

This statement is effective for the beginning of the first
annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. Therefore, the
Company will adopt the standard effective April 1, 2006 using the modified
prospective method. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company currently
accounts for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in APB No. 25 and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation
cost for employee stock options. Although the Company has not completed its assessment,
it believes the impact on its consolidated financial position or results or
operations will be material given the current number of outstanding stock
options. The effect on the Company’s results of operations of expensing stock
options using the Black-Scholes-Merton method is presented in the disclosure of
pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1. SFAS No. 123R also
requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash
flow as required under current literature. The standard also requires that tax
benefits must be realized through a reduction of income taxes that would
otherwise have been paid before the benefit can be recorded. This requirement
will reduce net operating cash flows and may increase net financing cash flows
in periods after adoption.

SPECIAL
CHARGES

Special charges consist

Fiscal 2005

Settlement with U.S. Philips
Corporation

In
fiscal 2005, the Company reached an agreement with U.S. Philips Corporation and
Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together “Philips”) regarding patent
license litigation. The agreement included dismissal of the then pending
litigation and the cross-license of certain patents between Philips and the
Company. The Company recorded a special charge of $21.1 million in the quarter
that ended June 30, 2004 associated with this matter. Pursuant to this
cross-license, the Company licensed certain of its patents related to 8-pin
microcontrollers to Philips, and Philips licensed its patents related to I


C serial communications to the
Company, each on fully-paid up, non-royalty bearing worldwide licenses. The
Company finalized and executed the definitive settlement agreement related to
this matter and made the cash payment to Philips during the fiscal quarter
ending September 30, 2004.

Fiscal 2004

Closure of Fab 1

On
April 7, 2003, the Company announced its intention to close its Chandler,
Arizona (Fab 1) wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain Fab 1
personnel and processes into its Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) wafer fabrication
facility. The Company completed this integration process during the three-month
period ended June 30, 2003. The closure of Fab 1 and the integration of certain
Fab 1 personnel into Fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of 207
employees who were either directly involved in the Company’s manufacturing
operations or provided support functions to Fab 1. The detail of the charges
incurred related to the closure of Fab 1 that were included in cost of
sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003 is as follows (amounts in
thousands):

Accelerated
  depreciation for Fab 1

$

30,608

Fab 1 related
  charges including severance, material and other costs

1,147

Total charges in cost of sales

$

31,755

The
facility where Fab 1 was located is an integral part of the Company’s overall
campus in Chandler, Arizona. Within this same facility resides the Company’s
wafer probe, mask making and other manufacturing related activities. Consequently
it is not possible to abandon or otherwise dispose of this facility. The
accelerated depreciation that was taken only related to assets used in the
wafer fabrication operations at the facility. The Company has no specific plans
for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations, and
intends to leave it in an idle state. The property, plant and equipment that
was subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and
accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property, plant and equipment
section of the Company’s balance sheet and related footnote disclosures.

The
Company incurred $865,000 of special charges recorded principally for contract
cancellation, severance and other costs related to the closure of Fab 1 and
other actions.

INVESTMENTS

The Company’s
investments are intended to establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal,
meets liquidity needs, avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an
appropriate yield in relationship to the Company’s investment guidelines and
market conditions. The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities
at March 31, 2006 (amounts in thousands):

F-11

In November 2005, the
FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,” (“FSP 115-1”) which
provided guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity
securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary,
and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115-1 was adopted by the Company on
January 1, 2006 and at March 31, 2006, the Company evaluated its investment
portfolio, and noted unrealized losses of $16.7 million were due to
fluctuations in interest rates. Management does not believe any of the
unrealized losses represented an other-than-temporary impairment based on its
evaluation of available evidence as of March 31, 2006. The Company’s intent is to
hold these investments to such time as these assets are no longer impaired. For
those investments not scheduled to mature until after March 31, 2007, such
recovery is not anticipated to occur in the next year and these investments
have been classified as long-term investments. At March 31, 2006, short-term
investments consist of $199,491 and long-term investments consist of $520,360.

The amortized cost and
estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2006, by
maturity, are shown below (amounts in thousands). Expected maturities can
differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may
have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties, and the
Company views its available-for-sale securities as available for current
operations.

The following is a
summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2005 (amounts in thousands):

All the investments at
March 31, 2005 were classified as short-term.

During the year ended
March 31, 2006, the Company had gross realized losses on available-for-sale
securities of eight thousand dollars. During the year ended March 31, 2005, the
Company did not have any gross realized gains or losses on sales of
available-for-sale securities.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist of the
following (amounts in thousands):

The Company amortizes intangible
assets over their expected useful lives, which range between 1 and 10 years. The
weighted average total amortization period for the Company’s intangible assets
at March 31, 2006 was 7 years, consisting of 6 years for developed technology
and 10 years for distribution rights. The following is an expected amortization
schedule for the intangible assets for the fiscal years March 31, 2007 through
March 31, 2011, absent any future acquisitions or impairment charges (amounts

The Company has not recorded any
impairment losses associated with the intangible assets acquired.

9.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

The Company had
short-term debt of $269.0 million and $45.5 million at March 31, 2006 and March
31, 2005, respectively. The short-term debt is a result of repurchase
agreements that are in place with two investment brokerages. The short-term
debt was collateralized with $277.6 million and $47.5 million of
available-for-sale investments at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
short-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 4.83% and 2.71% as of
March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2006, the borrowings were made
to complete a $500 million repatriation of foreign earnings under the American
Jobs Creation Act. The borrowings were collateralized against investments that
are held by the Company’s offshore subsidiaries. The Company presently intends
to pay down the short-term borrowings as the investments mature and also from
future offshore cash generation. In fiscal 2005, the Company used these
borrowings to fund the activity under its stock repurchase programs beginning
in the second quarter of the year ended March 31, 2005. There are no covenants
associated with the repurchase agreements.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES

Accrued
liabilities consist of the following (amounts in thousands):

INCOME TAXES

The
provision for income taxes consists of the following (amounts in thousands):

The tax
benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes
currently payable by $29.4 million, $15.3 million and $37.6 million
for the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts
were credited to additional paid-in capital in each of the three fiscal years.

The provision for income taxes
differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal tax rate to
income before income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences in
the total income tax provision are as follows (amounts in thousands):

F-15

Pretax income from foreign
operations was $257.8 million, $199.0 million and $136.3 million for the
years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Unremitted
foreign earnings that are considered to be permanently invested outside the
United States, and on which no deferred taxes have been provided, amounted to
approximately $483.9 million at March 31, 2006. Should the Company elect
in the future to repatriate a portion of the foreign earnings so invested, the
Company would incur income tax expense on such repatriation, net of any
available deductions and foreign tax credits. This would result in additional
income tax expense beyond the computed expected provision in such periods.

The American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “Jobs Act”) created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to
repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85%
dividends-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled non-U.S.
corporations. During fiscal 2006, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
approved a domestic reinvestment plan, under which the Company repatriated
$500 million in earnings outside the U.S. pursuant to the Jobs Act. The
Company recorded additional tax expense in fiscal 2006 of approximately
$30.6 million ($0.14 per diluted common share) related to this decision to
repatriate non-U.S. earnings. This repatriation increased the Company’s effective
rate for fiscal 2006 by approximately 8.5 percentage points, to 32.5%. This
increase is reflected as a separate line item in the rate reconciliation table
above.

The tax effects of temporary
differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Management
believes that the Company’s results of future operations will generate
sufficient taxable income such that it is “more likely than not” that the deferred
tax assets will be realized.

At
March 31, 2006, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for federal
income tax purposes of approximately $12.8 million, which begins to expire
in varying amounts in the years 2020

through 2022. The
net operating loss carryforward is attributable to the acquisition of
PowerSmart in fiscal 2003. An analysis of the annual limitation on the utilization
of the PowerSmart net operating losses was performed in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 382. It was determined that Section 382 will not
limit the use of the PowerSmart net

F-16

operating
losses in full over the carryover period.

At
March 31, 2006, the Company had recorded credit carryforwards of approximately
$12.9 million for foreign tax credits and $18.8 million for research
and development credits. The foreign tax credits begin to expire in varying
amounts in the years ending March 31, 2014 through March 31, 2016, and the
research and development credits begin to expire in varying amounts in the
years ending March 31, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The Company believes that
all of its credit carryforwards will be utilized in future periods.

The Company’s Thailand manufacturing operations currently
benefit from numerous tax holidays granted to the Company based on its
investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand. The Company’s tax
holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times beginning in September 2006.
The Company does not expect the future expiration of any of its tax holiday
periods in Thailand to have a material impact on its effective tax rate. The
aggregate dollar benefits derived from these tax holidays approximated
$7.9 million, $11.5 million and $45.3 million for the years ended
March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The benefit the tax holiday had on
net income per share approximated $0.04, $0.05 and $0.21 for the years ended
March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The reduction in the benefits
derived from the Company’s tax holiday in Thailand in the years ended March 31,
2005 and March 31, 2006 compared to the year ended March 31, 2004 was a result
of changes in the Company’s overall international tax structure. These changes
did not have a material impact on the Company’s overall effective tax rate.

The Company is
currently under audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for
its fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. As part of this
ongoing audit, the IRS has proposed certain adjustments related to positions
reflected on these returns. The IRS has issued formal assessments for these
adjustments. The Company does not agree with these adjustments and is appealing
these assessments. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate
of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. The
Company believes that it maintains adequate tax reserves to offset any
potential tax liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of the pending
audit through either settlement or the appeals process with the IRS. The IRS
recently began an audit of the Company’s fiscal years ended March 31, 2002,
2003 and 2004. The Company believes that it maintains adequate tax reserves to
offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other audits
in the United States and other countries in which it does business. If such
amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such
reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves
are no longer deemed necessary. If such amounts ultimately prove to be less
than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would be recorded in
the period in which the assessment is determined.

12.

CONTINGENCIES

The
Company’s assembly and test facility in Thailand is located in Alphatechnopolis
Industrial Park near Bangkok on land to which the Company expects to acquire
title in accordance with its agreement with the landowner. Progress towards
obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due to a bankruptcy relating
to the seller of the land. At this time it is not possible to estimate when, or
if, transfer of full title will be completed. The Company has provided reserves
that it estimates will be adequate to obtain full title. Such reserves are set
at the estimated fair value of the land.

In
the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in a limited
number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur
uninsured liability in any one or more of them. Litigation relating to the
semiconductor industry is not uncommon, and the Company is, and from time to
time has been, subject to such litigation. In the Company’s opinion, based on
consultation with legal counsel, as of March 31, 2006, the effect of such
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

13.

STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

Stockholder
Rights Plan.

Effective October 11, 1999, the Company adopted
an Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement (the “Amended Rights
Agreement”). The Amended Rights Agreement amends and restates the Preferred
Share Rights Agreement adopted by the Company as of February 13, 1995 (the “Prior
Rights Agreement”). Under the Prior Rights Agreement, on February 13, 1995, the
Company’s Board of Directors

F-17

declared a dividend of
one right (a “Right”) to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of the Company’s
Series A Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) for each
outstanding share of common stock, $.001 par value, of the Company. The
dividend was payable on February 24, 1995 to stockholders of record as of the
close of business on that date. The Amended Rights Agreement supersedes the
Prior Rights Agreement as originally executed. Under the Amended Rights
Agreement, each Right enables the holder to purchase from the Company one
one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred at a purchase price of seventy
four dollars and seven cents ($74.07) (the “Purchase Price”), subject to
adjustment. Under the Amended Rights Agreement, the rights will become
exercisable upon the earlier of (i) 10 days following a public announcement
that a person or a group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or
obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
Company’s outstanding common shares, or (ii) 10 days (or such later date as may
be determined by action of the Company’s Board of Directors) following the
commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or
exchange offer the consummation of which would result in a beneficial ownership
by a person or group of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common shares.

Stock
Repurchase Activity.

On August 7, 2002, the Company’s Board
of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 2,500,000 shares of its
common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of
March 31, 2006, the Company had repurchased the entire 2,500,000 common share
authorization for $59.3 million. On March 11, 2004, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of its
common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of
March 31, 2006, the Company had repurchased the entire 2,500,000 common share
authorization for $66.1 million. On April 22, 2004, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of its
common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of
March 31, 2006, the Company had repurchased 1,004,834 shares under this
authorization for $26.6 million. As of March 31, 2006, all of the purchased
shares under the authorizations had been reissued to fund stock option
exercises and purchases under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. During
the year ended March 31, 2006, the Company purchased 119,934 shares of its
common stock for $3.3 million. During the year ended March 31, 2005, the
Company purchased 2,184,800 shares of its common stock for $57.7

million. During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Company
purchased 2,435,400 shares of its common stock for $63.9 million, of which
$10.6 million was not paid until April 2004 and is reflected in the March 31,
2004 accounts payable balance.

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

The Company maintains a
contributory profit-sharing plan for its domestic employees meeting certain
eligibility and service requirements. The plan qualifies under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and allows employees to
contribute up to 60% of their base salary, subject to maximum annual
limitations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company shall make
a matching contribution of up to 25% of the first 4% of the participant’s
eligible compensation and may award up to an additional 25% under the
discretionary match. All matches are provided on a quarterly basis and require
the participant to be an active employee at the end of each quarter. For the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company contributions to
the plan totaled $1.5

million, $1.4
million and $1.1 million, respectively.

The Company’s 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2001
Purchase Plan”) became effective on March 1, 2002. The Board of Directors
approved the 2001 Purchase Plan in May 2001 and the stockholders approved it in
August 2001. Under the 2001 Purchase Plan, eligible employees of the Company
may purchase shares of common stock at semi-annual intervals through periodic
payroll deductions. The purchase price in general will be 85% of the lower of
the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the participant’s
entry date into the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the
semi-annual purchase date. Depending upon a participant’s entry date into the
2001 Purchase Plan, purchase periods under the 2001 Purchase Plan consist of
overlapping periods of either 24, 18, 12 or 6 months in duration. 2,450,000
shares of common stock have been previously reserved for issuance under the
2001 Purchase Plan. In May 2003, the Board of Directors reserved an additional
975,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2001 Purchase Plan, which
was approved by the stockholders in August 2003. In May 2003 and August 2003,
the Company’s Board and stockholders, respectively, each approved an annual
automatic increase in the number of shares reserved under the 2001 Purchase
Plan. The automatic increase took effect on January 1, 2005, and on each
January 1 thereafter during the term of the plan, and is equal to the lesser of
(i) 1,500,000 shares, (ii) one half of one percent (0.5%) of the then
outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, or (iii) such lesser amount
as is approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. On

January 1, 2006, 1,058,541 additional shares were reserved
under the 2001 Purchase Plan based on the automatic increase. On January 1,
2005, 1,035,863

additional
shares were reserved under the 2001 Purchase Plan based on the automatic
increase. Since the inception of the 2001 Purchase Plan, 5,519,404 shares of
common stock have been reserved for issuance and 1,814,452 shares have been
issued under this purchase plan.

During fiscal 1995, a purchase plan was adopted for
employees in non-U.S. locations. Such plan allows for the purchase price per
share to be 100% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the
beginning or end of the semi-annual purchase plan period. Effective May 1,
2006, the Company’s Board approved a purchase price per share equal to
eighty-five percent (85%) of the lower of the fair market value of the common
stock at the beginning or end of the semi-annual purchase plan period. Since
the inception of this purchase plan, 348,593 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance and 245,311 shares have been issued under this purchase
plan.

Effective
January 1, 1997, the Company adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation
arrangement. This plan is unfunded and is maintained primarily for the purpose
of providing deferred compensation for a select group of highly compensated
employees as defined in ERISA Sections 201, 301 and 401. There are no Company
matching contributions made under this plan.

The Company has a management incentive compensation plan
which provides for bonus payments, based on a percentage of base salary, from
an incentive pool created from operating profits of the Company, at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. During the years ended March 31, 2006,
March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, $14.1 million, $10.2 million and $1.8
million were charged against operations for this plan, respectively.

The
Company also has a plan that, at the discretion of the Board of Directors,
provides a cash bonus to all employees of the Company based on the operating
profits of the Company. During the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
$9.4 million, $4.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, were charged against
operations for this plan.

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

Under
the Company’s equity incentive plans (the “Plans”), eligible participants may
be granted different types of equity incentive awards. Officers, key employees,
non-employee directors and consultants may be granted non-statutory stock options
to purchase shares of common stock at a price not less than 100% of the fair
value of the option shares on the grant date. Options granted under the Plans
vest over the period determined by the Board of Directors at the date of grant,
at periods ranging from one year to five years. The maximum term of options
granted under the Plans is 10 years.  Historically the Company has gone through its
equity compensation grant process during the first two weeks of April each
year.  At March 31, 2006, there were 13,277,078 shares
available for grant under the Plans. The per share weighted average fair value
of stock options granted under the Plans for the years ended March 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 was $9.89, $15.82 and $12.06, respectively, based on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions:

In light of recent
regulatory guidance, the Company refined the assumptions used to estimate the
value of employee stock options granted in the first quarter of fiscal 2006,
and management determined that a blend of implied volatility and historical
volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of
expected volatility than using purely historical volatility. Management
continued to use this volatility assumption throughout fiscal 2006.

Under
the Plans, 105,281,645 shares of common stock had been reserved for issuance
since the inception of the Plans.

The stock option activity
is as follows:

The following table
summarizes information about the stock options outstanding at March 31, 2006:

F-20

At
March 31, 2006 and 2005, the number of option shares exercisable was 12,762,774
and 16,014,070, respectively, and the weighted-average exercise price of those
options was $19.39 and $18.09, respectively.

The
Company received a tax benefit of $29.4 million, $15.3 million and $37.6
million for the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from
the exercise of non-qualified stock options and the disposition of stock
acquired with incentive stock options or through the Company’s employee stock
purchase plan. For financial reporting purposes, the tax effect of this
deduction is accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather
than as a reduction of income tax expense.

During the year ended
March 31, 2006, the Company began issuing Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under
its equity incentive plan. RSUs entitle the holder to receive shares of the
Company’s common stock as the RSU vests. As of March 31, 2006, the total amount
of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards
was approximately $5.7 million, and the related weighted-average period over
which it is expected to be recognized is approximately 2.2 years. A summary of
restricted stock units activity for the year ended March 31, 2006 is as
follows:

The share-based
compensation expensed on the Company’s income statement in fiscal 2006 was $0.6
million.

operations
and other functions performed, and certain foreign sales offices receive
compensation for sales within their territory. Accordingly, for financial
statement purposes, it is not meaningful to segregate sales or operating
profits for the assembly and test and foreign sales office operations. Identifiable
long-lived assets (consisting of property, plant and equipment and goodwill) by
geographic area are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Sales
to unaffiliated customers located outside the United States, primarily in Asia

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair
value because their maturity is less than three months. The carrying amount of
short-term and long-term investments approximates fair value as the securities
are marked to market as of each balance sheet date with any unrealized gains
and losses reported in stockholders’ equity. The carrying amount of accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value
due to the short-term maturity of the amounts. The fair value of short-term
debt and lines of credit approximates their carrying value as they are
estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates currently offered to
the Company for similar debt instruments.

The
Company has entered into certain financial instruments in the normal course of
business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These
financial instruments include standby letters of credit and foreign currency
forward contracts. When engaging in forward contracts, risks arise from the
possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and
from movements in securities values, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
At March 31, 2006, the Company held contracts with nominal amounts totaling
$1.6 million, which were entered into and hedged the Company’s foreign
currency risk. The value of the contracts is based on quoted market prices. The
contracts matured in April 2006. At March 31, 2005, there were no foreign
currency forward contracts outstanding. Unrealized gains and losses as of the
balance sheet dates and realized gains and losses for the years ending
March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not material.
