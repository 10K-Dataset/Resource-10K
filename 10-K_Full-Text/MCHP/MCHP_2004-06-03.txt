Industry Background

Competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of

products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while

maintaining or reducing cost.  To

address these requirements, manufacturers often use integrated circuit-based embedded

control systems that enable them to:

•

differentiate their products

•

replace less efficient

electromechanical control devices

•

reduce the number of components in

their system

•

add product functionality

•

decrease time to market for their

products, and

•

significantly reduce product cost.


Embedded control systems also facilitate the emergence of complete new

classes of products.  Embedded control

systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in

a wide variety of markets worldwide, including:

Embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the

principal active, and sometimes sole, component.  A microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip

consisting of a central processing unit, non-volatile program memory, random

access memory for data storage and various input/output peripheral

capabilities.  In addition to the

microcontroller, a complete embedded control system incorporates

application-specific software and may include specialized peripheral device

controllers and internal or external non-volatile memory components, such as

EEPROMs, to store additional program software, and various analog and interface

products.

The increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for

microcontrollers one of the largest segments of the semiconductor market.  Microcontrollers are currently available in

4-bit through 32-bit architectures. 

Although 4-bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive, they

generally lack the minimum performance and features required for product

differentiation and are typically used only to produce basic functionality in

products.  While traditional 16 and

32-bit architectures provide very high performance, they are generally more

expensive for most high-volume embedded control applications, typically costing

significantly more than the cost of an 8-bit microcontroller.  As a result, manufacturers of competitive,

high-volume products have found 8-bit microcontrollers to be the most

cost-effective embedded control solution.

Most microcontrollers shipped today are ROM-based and must be

programmed by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing, resulting in 10

to 12-week lead times, based on current market conditions, for delivery of such

microcontrollers.  In addition to delayed product introduction,

these long lead times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and

temporary factory shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required. To

address these issues, some suppliers offer programmable microcontrollers that

can be configured by the customer in the customer’s manufacturing line, thus

minimizing lead-time and inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes

occur.  While these microcontrollers

were initially expensive relative to ROM-based microcontrollers, manufacturing

technology has evolved over the last several years to the point where

reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over

ROM-based microcontrollers, thus providing significant value to microcontroller

customers.  As a result, reprogrammable

microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the 8-bit microcontroller

market.

Our Products

Our strategic focus is on embedded control products, including:

•

microcontrollers

•

high-performance

linear and mixed-signal devices

•

power management

and thermal management devices

•

smart battery

management devices, and

•

complementary

microperipheral products including interface devices, Serial EEPROMs, and our

patented KEELOQ

®

security devices.

We provide highly cost-effective embedded control products that also

offer the advantages of small size, high performance, low voltage/power

operation and ease of development, enabling timely and cost-effective embedded

control product integration by our customers.


Microcontrollers

We offer a broad family of microcontroller products featuring a unique,

proprietary architecture marketed under the PIC

®

brand name.  We believe that our PIC

®

product

family is a price/performance leader in the worldwide microcontroller

market.  We have shipped over 3 billion

PIC

®

microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their

introduction in 1990.  Our PIC

®

products are designed for applications requiring field-programmability, high

performance, low power and cost effectiveness. 

They feature a variety of memory technology configurations, low voltage

and power, small footprint and ease of use. 

Over the last three years, all of our new microcontroller product

development has been focused on reprogrammable (Flash) based PIC

microcontrollers.  Our performance

results from an exclusive product architecture which features dual data and

instruction pathways, referred to as a Harvard dual-bus architecture; a reduced

instruction set, referred to as RISC; and variable length instructions; all of

which provide significant speed advantages over alternative single-bus, CISC

architectures.  With over 210 microcontrollers in our product portfolio, we target the

entire performance range of 8-bit microcontrollers.  Additionally, our scalable product architecture allows us to

successfully target both the entry-level of the 16-bit microcontroller market,

as well as the higher end of the 4-bit microcontroller marketplace,

significantly enlarging our addressable market.

We have used our manufacturing experience and design and process

technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to

the development and production of our PIC

®

family of microcontroller

products.  Our extensive experience base

has enabled us to develop our advanced, low cost user programmability feature

by incorporating non-volatile memory, such as Flash, EEPROM and EPROM Memory, into

the microcontroller, and to be a leader in reprogrammable (Flash)

microcontroller product offerings.

Digital Signal Controllers

We recently began production shipments of our Digital Signal Controller

product line.  Our family of dsPIC

ä

microcontrollers is a series of high-performance 16-bit microcontrollers,

combining the many features and capabilities of our PIC

®

family of

8-bit microcontrollers with the high-performance capabilities of a digital

signal processor (DSP).  During the last

three fiscal years, all of our Digital Signal Controller product development

has been focused on reprogrammable (Flash) products.

Our dsPIC

ä

product family

will offer a broad development tool suite of hardware and software to ease the

effort of the designer, high-performance Harvard dual-bus architecture and a

proliferation of integrated peripherals to monitor and control many aspects of

the embedded control product.  With its

field-re-programmability, program memory, low power, small footprint and ease

of use, we believe that our dsPIC

ä

microcontrollers will significantly enlarge our

addressable market.

Development Systems

We offer a comprehensive set of low cost and easy-to-learn application

development tools.  These tools enable

system designers to quickly and easily program a PIC

®

microcontroller for specific applications and are a key factor for obtaining

design wins.

Our family of development tools operates in the standard Windows

®

environment on standard PC hardware. 

Entry-level systems, which include an assembler and programmer or

in-circuit debugging hardware are priced at less than $200.  Fully configured systems that provide

in-circuit emulation hardware are priced between $2,000 and $3,500.  Customers moving from entry-level designs to

those requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve their investment in

learning and tools as they migrate to future PIC

®

devices since all

systems share the same integrated development environment.

Many independent companies also develop and market application development

tools and systems that support our standard microcontroller product

architecture.  Currently, there are more

than 150 third-party tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our

proprietary microcontroller architecture.

We believe that familiarity with and adoption of our, and third-party,

development systems by an increasing number of product designers will be an

important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products.  These development tools allow design

engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our

standard microcontrollers.  To date, we

have shipped more than 300,000 development systems.


ASSPs

Our application-specific standard products, referred to as ASSPs, are

specialized products designed to perform specific end-user applications,

compared to our other products that are more general purpose in nature.  Our ASSP device families currently include,

among others, the KEELOQ

®

family of secure data transmission

products and smart battery management products.

Analog and Interface Products

Our analog and interface products now consist of several families with

over 380 power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management and

interface products.  At the end of

fiscal 2004, our mixed-signal analog and interface products were being shipped

to more than 8,900 end customers.

We continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products

into our existing microcontroller customer base, which we refer to as our

analog “attach” strategy, as well as to new customers.  In addition to our “attach” strategy, we

market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional PIC

®

microcontroller and memory products customer base.  We market these, and all of our products, based on a “functions”

approach, targeted to solve different problems in development of our customers’

products.

Memory Products

Our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable

programmable read only memory, referred to as EEPROMs.  We sell these devices primarily into the

embedded control market, and we are one of the largest suppliers of such

devices worldwide.  EEPROM products are

used for non-volatile program and data storage in systems where such data must

be either modified frequently or retained for long periods.  Serial EEPROMs have a very low I/O pin

requirement, permitting production of very small devices.

We address customer requirements by offering products with extremely

small package sizes and very low operating voltages for both read and write

functions.  High performance circuitry

and microcode are also available to reduce power consumption when a device is

not in use, while permitting immediate operating capability when required.  Our memory products also feature long data

retention and high erase/write endurance.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations include wafer

fabrication and assembly and test.  The

ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our

business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing

control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded

control industry.  By owning our wafer

fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations, and by

employing proprietary statistical process control techniques, we have been able

to achieve and maintain high production yields.  Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten

our design and production cycles.  This

control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the

assembly and testing profit margin.

Our manufacturing facilities are located in:

•

Chandler,

Arizona (probe operations)

•

Tempe, Arizona

(Fab 2)

•

Puyallup,

Washington (Fab 3) (non-operational-held for sale)

•

Gresham, Oregon

(Fab 4), and

•

Bangkok,

Thailand (assembly and test).

Wafer Fabrication

On April 7, 2003, we announced our

intention to close our Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1) wafer fabrication facility and

integrate certain Fab 1 personnel and processes into our Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2)

wafer fabrication facility.  We

completed this integration process during the three-month period ended

June 30, 2003.  The closure of Fab

1 and the integration of certain Fab 1 personnel into our Fab 2 operations

resulted in a reduction in force of 207 employees who were either directly

involved in our manufacturing operations or provided support functions to Fab

1.


The facility where Fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall

campus in Chandler, Arizona.  Within

this same facility resides our wafer probe, mask making and other manufacturing

related activities.  We have no specific

plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication

operations, and intend to leave it in an idle status.

Fab 2 currently produces 8-inch wafers and supports manufacturing

processes between 0.35 and 5.0 microns. 

During fiscal 2004, Fab 2 operated at approximately 91% of its capacity

compared to approximately 88% during fiscal 2003.  Operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive impact

on operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in our

wafer fabrication manufacturing.

Fab 3 is non-operational and is currently classified as an asset

held-for-sale.  See “

Item 7 -

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations – Special Charges – Fab 3 Impairment Charge

,” below at

page 33, for a discussion of the

status of Fab 3.

Fab 4 was acquired in August 2002 and began production on

October 31, 2003.  Fab 4 produces

8-inch wafers using 0.5 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of

supporting technologies below 0.18 microns. 

We are in the early states of ramping our production activities at Fab

4.  Fab 4 has an installed equipment

base that will allow us to produce an additional $600 to $800 million in annual

product sales.  We believe the combined

capacity of Fab 2 and Fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to

respond to increases in future demand.

We continue to transition products to more advanced process

technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.  We believe that our successful transition to more advanced

process technologies is important for us to remain competitive.  Our future operating results could be

adversely affected if any such transition is substantially delayed or

inefficiently implemented.

We also contract with third-party wafer foundries to fabricate less

than 5% of our total production, primarily in our analog and smart battery

management product families.  We have

transitioned many of these products to our own wafer fabrication facilities and

plan to continue to do so over time.  On

a strategic basis, we will continue to use third-party foundries to shorten our

product design cycle on certain key technologies and products.

Assembly and Test

We perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near

Bangkok, Thailand.  At March 31,

2004, approximately 71% of our assembly requirements were being performed in

our Thailand facility.  As of

March 31, 2004, our Thailand facility was testing substantially all of our

wafer production.  As of April 30,

2004, we had substantially completed a 67,000 square foot expansion at our

Thailand facility that, once placed in service, will increase the facility’s

test capacity by approximately 80%.  The

expansion area is expected to be placed in service in fiscal 2005.  We also use third-party assembly and test

contractors in several Asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test

requirements.

General Matters

Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations

We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing

our microcontroller and memory products. 

We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in

existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product

designs.  While many of our competitors

develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product

lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and

non-volatile memory products.  This

allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and

to deliver new products to market more rapidly.  Our engineers utilize advanced CAD tools and software to perform

circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer

fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by

processing test wafers quickly and efficiently.

Due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing,

consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our

gross profit and overall operating results. 

During fiscal 2004, our focus on manufacturing productivity allowed us

to maintain average wafer fab line yields at our facilities in excess of

95%.  Our manufacturing yields are

primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process

control, extensive employee training and selective upgrading of our

manufacturing facilities and equipment. 

Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important

factors in the achievement of our operating results.  The manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits, particularly

non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices, such as those that we

produce, are complex processes.  These

processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of

contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used

and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment.  As is


typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time

experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.  Our operating results will suffer if we are

unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels.

Our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and

equipment that must meet exacting standards. 

We generally have more than one source for these supplies, but there are

only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials

and equipment that meet our standards. 

In addition, the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business

could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in

product applications increases.  We have

experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion our

suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our

orders.  An interruption of any raw

materials or equipment sources could harm our business.

Our reliance on third parties for a portion of wafer fabrication and

assembly and testing involves some reduction in our level of control over the

portions of our business that we subcontract. 

While we review the quality, delivery and cost performance of these third-party

contractors, our future operating results could suffer if any third-party

contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields

and costs at approximately their current levels.

The foregoing statements related to the equipment base at Fab 4

allowing us to produce an additional $600 to $800 million in annual

product sales, the combined capacity of Fab 2 and Fab 4 providing sufficient

capacity to allow us to respond to future increases in demand and the

transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing

costs are forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially

because of the following factors, among others: changes in utilization of our

current manufacturing capacity; unanticipated costs in continuing to ramp

production at Fab 4; our ability to increase production at Fab 2; the ability

to attract and retain qualified personnel in the Portland, Oregon area; changes

in demand for products and the products of our customers; changes in demand for

our analog and battery management products; supply disruption; absorption of

fixed costs, labor and other direct manufacturing costs; fluctuations in

production yields; production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization;

changes in product mix; competitive pressures on prices; labor unrest;

political instability and expropriation; and other general economic conditions.

Research and

Development (R&D)

We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced

products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing

process technologies.  We believe these

investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive

position.  Our current R&D

activities focus on the design of new 8-bit microcontrollers, 16-bit digital

signal controllers, memory and mixed-signal products, ASSPs, new development

systems, and software and application-specific software libraries.  We are also developing new design and

process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance

improvements in existing products.

In fiscal 2004, our R&D expenses were $85.4 million, compared to

$88.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $81.7 million in fiscal 2002.

Sales and

Distribution

General

We market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct

sales personnel and distributors.

Our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in

three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently maintain sales and support

centers in major metropolitan areas in North America, Europe and Asia.  We believe that a strong technical service

presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control

market.  The majority of our field sales

engineers (FSEs), field application engineers (FAEs), and sales management have

technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering

environment.  We believe that the

technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the

sale of our products.  The primary

mission of our FAE team is to provide technical assistance to strategic

accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for FSEs and distributor

sales teams.  FAEs also frequently

conduct technical seminars in major cities around the world, and work closely

with our distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.


Distribution

Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical

support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors provide an

effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.

In fiscal 2004, we derived 64% of our net sales from sales through

distributors and 36% of our net sales from direct sales to original equipment

manufacturers, referred to as OEM customers. 

Distributors accounted for 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and 62%

of our net sales in fiscal 2002.  Our

two largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 25%

of

our net sales for fiscal 2004 and 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.

In fiscal 2004, our two largest

distributors accounted for 13% and 12%, respectively, of our net sales.  In fiscal 2003 and 2002, one distributor

accounted for 12% and 13%, respectively, of our net sales.  No other distributor or end customer

accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or

our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little

or no advanced notice.  The loss of, or

the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could

reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase

in inventory returns.

Distributors generally have broad-based rights to return product to

us.  As revenue on distributor shipments

is not recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end

customers, distributor returns have no impact on our revenue.

We also grant certain credits to our third-party distributors and also

offer these distributors price protection. 

The credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified

pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross

margin on the sale of our products to their end customers.  The credits are on a per unit basis and are

not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale

to their end customer.  The effect of

granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our

distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us

when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers.

We reduce product pricing through price protection based on market

conditions, competitive considerations and other factors.  Price protection is granted to third-party

distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price

protection is offered.  When we reduce

the selling price of our products, it allows the distributors to claim a credit

against its outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of

the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue recognition impact from

the price protections.

We do not offer material incentive programs to our third-party

distributors.

Sales by Geography

Sales by geography for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were

as follows (dollars in thousands):

Our sales to foreign customers have been predominately

in Asia and Europe, which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those

areas for automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial

control products.  Americas sales

include sales to customers in the United States, Canada, Central America and

South America.

Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately

71% of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and approximately 69% of

our net sales in fiscal 2002.


Sales to customers in China, including Hong Kong,

accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and

approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.  We did not have sales into any other foreign countries that

exceeded 10% of our net sales during the periods covered by this report.

Our international sales are predominately U.S. Dollar

denominated.  Although foreign sales are

subject to certain government export restrictions, we have not experienced any material

difficulties as a result of export restrictions to date.

Our foreign operations are subject to a number of

risks as described under the heading,

“We are highly dependent on foreign sales and

operations, which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks

,”

on page 15.

Backlog

As of April 23, 2004, our backlog was approximately $209.9

million, compared to $106.6 million as of April 25, 2003.  Our backlog includes all purchase orders

scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months.

We primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from

inventory within a short time after we receive an order.  Our business and, to a large extent, that of

the entire semiconductor industry, is characterized by short-term orders and

shipment schedules.  Orders constituting

our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules, or to

cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty.  Thus, while backlog is useful for scheduling

production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of

sales for any future period.   During

the last two quarters of fiscal 2004, our product lead times extended and

resulted in customers providing us with additional backlog leading to improved

visibility.

Competition

The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been

characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change.  We compete with major domestic and

international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market

recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other

resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing,

marketing and distribution of their products. 

Emerging companies may also increase their participation in the market

for embedded control applications. 

Furthermore, capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally

increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product

availability could adversely affect our competitive position.

We currently compete principally on the basis of the technical

innovation and performance of our embedded control products, including the

following product characteristics:

We believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded

control market include:

•

ease of use

•

functionality of

application development systems

•

dependable

delivery and quality, and

•

technical

service and support.

We believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of

these factors, but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future,

which could harm our business.

Patents, Licenses and

Trademarks

We maintain a portfolio of United States and foreign patents, expiring

on various dates between 2005 and 2022. 

We also have numerous additional United States and foreign patent

applications pending.  While we intend

to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes, we

believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological


skills and innovative abilities of our personnel and our ability to

rapidly commercialize product developments, rather than on our patents.  Our existing patents and any new patents

that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide

meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us.  In addition, the laws of certain foreign

countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as

the laws of the United States.

We have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and

cross-licenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and

manufacturing processes.  As is typical

in the semiconductor industry, we and our customers have from time to time

received, and may in the future receive, communications from third parties

asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our

products or technologies.  We

investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate.  Based on industry practice, we believe that

in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on

commercially reasonable terms, but we cannot assure that licenses would be on

acceptable terms, that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past

infringement would not be assessed. 

Litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and divert

management effort, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual

property rights, or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of

others.  The failure to obtain necessary

licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of infringement claims,

could harm our business.  See “

Item 3 –

Legal Proceedings

,” beginning below at page 18.

Environmental Regulation

We must comply with many different federal, state and local

governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of

certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes.  Our facilities have been designed to comply

with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in

compliance with such regulations.  Any

changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire

costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with

environmental regulations.  Any failure

by us to control adequately the storage, use and disposal of regulated

substances could result in future liabilities.

Increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental

impact of electronic manufacturing operations. 

While we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our

operations from environmental regulations, our business and results of

operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of, or to

restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or

future environmental regulations.

Employees

Additional Factors

That May Affect Our Results of Operations

When evaluating Microchip and its business, you should give careful

consideration to the factors listed below, in addition to the information

provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with

the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Our quarterly

operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our net sales

and profitability

.

Our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of

factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability, many of which are

beyond our control.  Some of the factors

that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

changes in demand or market

acceptance of our products and products of our customers

•

unanticipated costs or delays in

continuing to ramp production at Fab 4

•

the mix of inventory we hold and our

ability to satisfy orders from our inventory

•

levels of inventories at our

customers

•

changes in utilization of our

manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields

•

our ability to secure sufficient

assembly and testing capacity

•

competitive developments including

pricing pressures

•

the level of orders that are received

and can be shipped in a quarter

•

the level of sell-through of our

products through distribution

•

changes or fluctuations in customer

order patterns and seasonality

•

constrained availability from other

electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability to ship their products,

which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers

•

costs and outcomes of any tax audits

or any litigation involving intellectual property, customers or other issues


•

disruptions in our business or our

customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, worldwide

oil prices and supply, public health concerns or disruptions in the

transportation system

•

property damage or other losses which

are not covered by insurance, and

•

general economic, industry or

political conditions in the United States or internationally.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results

are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such

comparisons as indications of future performance.  In future periods our operating results may fall below our public

guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which

would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.

Our operating

results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or

fail to maintain manufacturing yields.

The manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits, particularly

non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices such as those that we

produce, are complex processes.  These

processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of

contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used

and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry,

we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing

yields.  Our operating results will

suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels.

Our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at

less than optimal capacity.  Lower

capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense

and lower gross margins.

If we do not ramp

our production activities at our Fab 4 (Gresham, Oregon) wafer fabrication

facility in a timely manner, our anticipated revenues and gross margins may be

adversely impacted.

We acquired Fab 4, located in Gresham, Oregon, in

August 2002.  Fab 4 commenced

production on October 31, 2003. 

Bringing Fab 4 to higher levels of production involves significant

risks, including:

•

successful implementation of our manufacturing

processes at Fab 4

•

potential shortages of materials and skilled labor

•

unforeseen environmental or engineering problems;

and

•

unanticipated costs.

Any of these risks could delay the ramp-up of Fab 4, and could result

in significant additional costs or reduce our anticipated revenues.

As a result of these and other factors, Fab 4 may not increase

production when anticipated or within budget. 

Also, we may be unable to achieve adequate manufacturing yields in Fab 4

in a timely manner and our revenues may not increase in proportion to the

anticipated increase in manufacturing capacity associated with Fab 4 which

would harm our operating results.

We are dependent on

orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore limited

in our visibility of future product shipments.

Our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of

shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that

quarter, which we refer to as turns orders. 

We emphasize our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part

of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with

relatively short delivery schedules. 

Shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of

our business is relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our

visibility on future product shipments. 

The percentage of turns orders in any given quarter fluctuates and

depends on overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times.

During fiscal 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, our

turns orders were at the high end of the range that we have experienced over

the last several years.  During the last

two quarters of fiscal 2004, our product lead times began to extend and

resulted in customers providing us with additional backlog leading to improved

visibility.  Because turns orders are

difficult to predict, varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more

difficult to forecast.  If we do not

achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to

our revenue targets, our revenue and operating results will suffer.


Intense competition

in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures, reduced sales of our

products or reduced market share.

The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been

characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change.  We compete with major domestic and

international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition

and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and

other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing,

marketing and distribution of their products. 

Emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market

for embedded control applications.  We

may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our

business.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both

within and outside our control, including:

•

the quality, performance, reliability,

features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of our products

•

our success in designing and

manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies

•

the rate at which customers

incorporate our products into their own products

•

product introductions by our

competitors

•

the number, nature and success of our

competitors in a given market

•

our ability to obtain adequate

supplies of raw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices

•

our ability to protect our products

and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights

•

the quality of our customer service

and our ability to address the needs of our customers, and

•

general market and economic

conditions.

Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry

decrease over the life of any particular product.  The overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and

proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant,

while average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM and non-proprietary analog

and interface products have declined, over time.  We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,

pricing pressure in certain of our proprietary product lines, due primarily to

competitive conditions.  We have been

able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary

product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and

higher prices.  We have experienced in

the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of

competitive pricing pressures in our Serial EEPROM products.

We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as

a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely

impact our operating results.

We must attract and

retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition for qualified

personnel is intense in our market.

Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior

management, engineering and other personnel. 

The competition for qualified engineering and management personnel is

intense.  We may be unsuccessful in

retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional

key personnel that we require.  The loss

of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key

personnel could harm our business.  We

have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team.

Our success depends

on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis.

Our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and

introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the

basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements.  The success of our new product introductions

depends on various factors, including:


•

proper new product selection

•

timely completion and introduction of

new product designs

•

development of support tools and

collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to

understand and use, and

•

market acceptance of our customers’

end products.

Because our products are complex, we have experienced delays from time

to time in completing development of new products.  In addition, our new products may not receive or maintain

substantial market acceptance.  We may

be unable to design, develop and introduce competitive products on a timely

basis, which could adversely impact our future operating results.

Our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new

design and process technologies. 

Semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid

technological change and require significant R&D expenditures.  We and other companies in the industry have,

from time to time, experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to

advanced process technologies and, consequently, have suffered reduced

manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries.  Our future operating results could be adversely affected if any

transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or

inefficiently implemented.

We are dependent on

several third-party contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us.

We use several third-party contractors located throughout Asia for a

portion of the assembly and testing of our products.  We also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of the

wafer fabrication of our analog and smart battery management products.  Although we have reduced our dependence on

third-party contractors over time, the disruption or termination of any of

these sources could harm our business and operating results.  Our use of third parties involves some

reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we

subcontract.  Our future operating results

could suffer if any third-party contractor were to experience financial,

operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds

capacity, or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and

test yields and costs at approximately their current levels.  In such case, we may not be able to qualify

additional manufacturing sources for our products on a timely manner or at all,

and such arrangements, if any, may not be on favorable terms to us.

We may lose sales if

our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs.

Our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and

equipment that must meet exacting standards. 

We generally have more than one source for these supplies, but there are

only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials

and equipment that meet our standards. 

The raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become

more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product

applications increases.  We have

experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion our

suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or

that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and

replacements parts.  An interruption of

any raw materials or equipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a

particular piece of equipment, could harm our business.

Our business is

highly dependent on selling through distributors.

Sales through distributors accounted for 64% of our net sales in fiscal

2004 and 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2003. 

Our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 25% of

our net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal

2003.  We do not have long-term

agreements with our distributors and our distributors may terminate their

relationship with us with little or no advanced notice.

The loss of, or a disruption in the operations of, one or more of our

distributors could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in

an increase in inventory returns.

Our operating

results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the

semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by wide fluctuations of

supply and demand.  The industry has

experienced significant economic downturns, characterized by diminished product

demand and production over-capacity.  We

have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling

proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly


replaced, to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad

range of market segments.  However, we

have experienced substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results

and may, in the future, experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating

results due to general industry or economic conditions.

We are exposed to

various risks related to legal proceedings or claims.

We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in legal

proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property

rights, contracts and other matters.  In

particular, as discussed in

Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K

, we are

presently involved in patent infringement litigation with Philips

Corporation.  In addition, as is typical

in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications from customers who

believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement

claims made against the customers by third parties.  These legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without

merit, could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources.  If we are not able to resolve a claim,

negotiate a settlement of a matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially

reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our

business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.

Failure to

adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or

market opportunities.

Our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property

rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our

success.  To that end, we have acquired

certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on

our inventions and manufacturing processes. 

The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and

patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications.  In addition, our existing patents and any

new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to

provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us.  We may be subject to or may initiate

interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which can

require significant financial and management resources.  In addition, the laws of certain foreign

countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as

the laws of the United States.  Infringement

of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in

uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us.

We do not have

long-term contracts with our customers

.

We do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our customers

and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers.  When we do enter into customer contracts,

the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer.  In the event of any early termination of a

contract by one of our major customers, it is unlikely that we would be able to

rapidly replace that revenue source which would harm our financial results.

Business

interruptions could harm our business.

Operations at any of our manufacturing facilities, or at any of our

wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors, may be disrupted for

reasons beyond our control, including work stoppages, power loss, incidents of

terrorism, political instability, public health issues, telecommunications

failure, fire, earthquake, floods, or other natural disasters.  If operations at any of our, or our

subcontractors’, facilities are interrupted, we may not be able to shift

production to other facilities on a timely basis.  If this occurs, we may experience delays in shipments of products

to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on

acceptable terms.  This could result in

reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of

customers.  In addition, business

interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any

losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of

business interruptions could significantly harm our business.

We are highly

dependent on foreign sales and operations, which exposes us to foreign

political and economic risks.

Sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net

sales.  During fiscal 2004 and fiscal

2003, approximately 71% of our net sales were made to foreign customers.  We purchase a substantial portion of our raw

materials and equipment from foreign suppliers.  In addition, we own product assembly and testing facilities

located near Bangkok, Thailand.  We also

use various foreign third-party contractors for a portion of our assembly and

testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements for our analog

and smart battery management products. 

Substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in

Thailand.


Our reliance on foreign operations, foreign suppliers, maintenance of

substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and

significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks,

including:

•

political, social and economic

instability

•

trade restrictions and changes in

tariffs

•

import and export license

requirements and restrictions

•

difficulties in staffing and managing

international operations

•

employment regulations

•

disruptions in international

transport or delivery

•

fluctuations in currency exchange

rates

•

difficulties in collecting

receivables

•

economic slowdown in the worldwide

markets served by us, and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

If any of these risks materialize, our sales could decrease and our

operating results could suffer.

We are subject to

stringent environmental regulation, which may force us to incur significant

expenses.

We must comply with many different federal, state and local

governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of

toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing

process.  Although we believe that our

activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations, our

failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the

imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of

operations.  Any such environmental

regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other

significant expenses to comply with such regulations.  Any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict

the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future

liabilities.  Environmental problems may

occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities.

Recently

enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related regulations could

result in increased costs to us.

Recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations

affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

of 2002 and recent rules enacted and proposed by the SEC, Nasdaq and the NYSE,

are resulting in increased costs to us as we respond to their

requirements.  In particular, complying

with the internal control audit requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404

will result in increased internal efforts and higher fees from our independent

accounting firm.  The new rules could

make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including

director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept

reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to

obtain the same or similar coverage. 

The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to

attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, on

committees of our Board of Directors, or as executive officers.  We cannot predict or estimate the amount of

the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs that we may incur

as we implement these new and proposed rules.

Recent and proposed

regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability

to attract and retain key personnel.

Since our inception, we have used stock options and other long-term

equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation

packages.  We believe that stock options

and other long-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to

maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage

employees to remain with Microchip.  The

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed changes to US GAAP

that, if implemented, would require us to record a charge to earnings for the

fair value of employee stock option grants, based on vesting beginning in

fiscal 2006.  This pending regulation would

negatively impact our earnings.  For

example, recording a charge for employee stock options under SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” would have decreased net income by

$36.8 million, $36.2 million and $29.4 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,

respectively.  See also Note 1 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements – Significant Accounting Policies:  Stock Based Compensation.  In addition, new regulations implemented by

The Nasdaq Stock Market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option

plans as well as new regulations implemented by the New York Stock Exchange

prohibiting NYSE member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on

equity-compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given

voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant options to

employees in the future.  To the extent

that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to

employees, we may incur compensation costs, change our equity compensation


strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate

employees, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

The future trading

price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to

a variety of factors.

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in

the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future.  The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to

wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond

our control, including:

•

quarterly variations in our operating

results and the operating results of other technology companies

•

actual or anticipated announcements

of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors

•

changes in analysts’ estimates of our

financial performance or buy/sell recommendations

•

changes in our financial guidance or

our failure to meet such guidance

•

general conditions in the

semiconductor industry, and

•

worldwide economic and financial

conditions.

In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and

volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many

high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating

performance of such companies.  These

broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our

common stock.

Item 2.

PROPERTIES

At March 31, 2004, we owned the facilities described below:

(1)

On April 7, 2003, we announced that we

would close Fab 1 on our Chandler campus, and integrate certain of the personnel

and processes from Fab 1 into Fab 2.

(2)

Currently classified as an asset

held-for-sale.  We have retained a

third-party broker who is actively marketing Fab 3 on our behalf.  See “

Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Special Charges –Fab 3

Impairment Charge,”

below at page 33 for a discussion of the status

of Fab 3.

(3)

Acquired in August 2002.  Product and customer qualifications

continue.  Production commenced on

October 31, 2003.

(4)

Located in the Alphatechnopolis Industrial

Park near Bangkok on land to which we expect to acquire title in accordance

with our agreement with the landowner. 

Progress towards obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due

to a complex financial restructuring situation relating to the seller of the

land.  At this time it is not possible

to estimate when, or if, full title transfer will be completed.  We have provided reserves that we estimate

will be adequate to obtain full title. 

Such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land.

(5)

Includes an additional 67,000 square feet of

test and incremental assembly capacity on which construction started during

fiscal 2003 and was completed in April 2004.

At the end of fiscal 2004, we owned long-lived assets in the United

States amounting to $620.4 million and $117.8 million in other countries,

including $111.8 million in Thailand. 

At the end of fiscal 2003, we owned long-lived assets in the United

States amounting to $715.6 million and $103.5 million in other countries,

including $96.4 million in Thailand.


In addition to the facilities we own, we lease several research and

development facilities and sales offices in North America, Europe and

Asia.  Our aggregate monthly rental

payment for our leased facilities is approximately $0.3 million.

We currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to

meet our requirements for the next 12 months.

As conditions in the insurance market have become more difficult over

the last two fiscal years, our property insurance costs have increased, our

coverage levels have decreased and our retained risk exposure from uninsured

losses has increased.  We have not made

any material change to our operations as a result of the increased costs and

reduced coverage.  Availability and cost

of coverage have generally fluctuated over time as the insurance industry

reacts to various market forces and we will consider modifying our coverage

levels in the future based on availability and pricing.

The foregoing statements related to the acquisition of title to the

land on which the Thailand facility is situated, the adequacy of existing

facilities for the next 12 months and changes in insurance coverage are

forward-looking statements.  Actual

results could differ materially because of the following factors, among others:

developments in the financial restructuring of the seller of the land where the

Thailand facility is situated; demand for our products; fluctuations in

production yields, production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization;

competitive pressures on prices; political instability and expropriation; cost

and availability of insurance; and other economic conditions.  See also the factors set forth under “Item 1

– Business – Additional Factors That May Affect Results of Operations,”

beginning at page 11 of this report.

Item 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Microchip Technology Incorporated v. U.S. Philips Corporation, et al

.

(

District

of Arizona, 01-CV-2090-PGR).

As

previously reported, on October 26, 2001, we filed an action in federal

district court in Arizona for declaratory relief against U.S. Philips

Corporation and Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together “Philips”)

requesting that the Court declare, among other matters, that we do not infringe

Philips’ U.S. Patent Nos. 4,689,740 and 5,559,502.  We initiated legal action so that a determination could be made

relating to the validity, enforceability and alleged infringement of, and our

license to, the Philips’ patents.  In

response to our filing the declaratory judgment action in Arizona, Philips

filed an action against us in federal district court in New York, alleging

infringement of the ‘740 patent and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive

relief.  The Arizona court has agreed to

retain jurisdiction, and the New York case has been transferred to

Arizona.  In response to this

development, on December 16, 2002, Philips filed a demand for arbitration

in Amsterdam with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  We submitted to the ICC Court of Arbitration

a jurisdictional objection to proceeding with arbitration pending the outcome

of the Arizona litigation.  On May 16,

2003, the ICC declined to address whether arbitration is inappropriate for jurisdictional

reasons and instead left the issue as one, which can be brought before the ICC

arbitration panel.  On June 13,

2003, the Arizona court granted Microchip’s motion to stay the ICC arbitration

and proceed with the action in Arizona. 

Philips has filed a motion to appeal the Arizona court order staying the

ICC arbitration.  On March 2, 2004,

the motion to appeal was argued by Philips’ and the Company’s counsel in the

U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 

At this time the ICC arbitration, the appeal of the Arizona court order

staying arbitration, and the Arizona declaratory judgment action are all

pending.  We intend to continue to

litigate this matter vigorously.  We

currently believe that the outcome of this matter will not have a material

adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of

operations.  However, the final outcome

of this matter is inherently uncertain, and should the outcome be adverse to

us, we may be required to pay damages and other expenses and may be subjected

to injunctive relief.  The litigation,

even if resolved in our favor, may also result in diversion of management

attention and significant legal fees.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited

number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur

uninsured liability in any one or more of them.  Although the outcome of these actions is not presently

determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not

harm our business.  Litigation relating

to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon, and we are, and from time to

time have been, subject to such litigation. 

No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any

such litigation in the future.

SELECTED

FINANCIAL DATA

You should read the following selected consolidated financial data for

the five-year period ended March 31, 2004 in conjunction with our

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and “Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

included in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Our consolidated statements of income data for each of the years in the

three-year period ended March 31, 2004, and the balance sheet data as of

March 31, 2004 and 2003, are derived from our audited consolidated

financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.


(1)

On January 16,

2001, we merged with TelCom Semiconductor, Inc. and accounted for the merger as

a pooling-of-interests.  Accordingly,

the selected financial data has been restated to include the operations of

TelCom for all periods presented. 

TelCom had a December 31 fiscal year end, thus the selected

financial data presented for March 31, 2000 has been combined with the

operations of TelCom as of and for the years ended December 31, 1999.  We have conformed the TelCom financial data

to a March 31 year end for the March 31, 2001 fiscal year.

There were no

special charges during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002.  Detailed discussions of the special charges

for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 are contained in Note 4

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Detailed explanations of the special charges, net loss in equity

investment, and gain on sale of investment for the fiscal years ended

March 31, 2001 and 2000 are provided below.  The following table presents a summary of special charges for the

five-year period ended March 31, 2004:

We changed our revenue recognition

policy as it relates to Asia regional distributors during fiscal 2003.  See “Item 7 –

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Change in Accounting Principle,

”

beginning at page 36 below, for

a discussion of this change.

Fiscal 2001

During the March 2001 quarter, we implemented capacity and cost

reduction actions necessitated by adverse business conditions in the semiconductor

industry.  We reduced cumulative wafer

fab capacity at Fabs 1 and 2 by approximately 24%, compared to our

December 31, 2000 levels.  We also

decided to close our Hong Kong test facility, acquired as part of the TelCom

transaction, and migrate these test requirements to our Thailand test

facility.  The capacity reduction at

Fabs 1 and 2 was completed by the end of the March 2001 quarter.  The closure of the Hong Kong facility was

completed by June 30, 2001.  These

actions resulted in a restructuring charge of $6.4 million in the

March 2001 quarter.  These actions

were undertaken to reduce both manufacturing capacity and manufacturing

costs.  The reduction in wafer fab

capacity was required due to reduced customer demand.  The closure of the Hong Kong facility was undertaken to

rationalize our test manufacturing capacity and migrate the test requirements

to our more cost-effective test facility in Thailand.

Included in the restructuring charges resulting from these actions

were:

•

$4.0 million

related to equipment that was written off

•

$2.1 million

related to employee severance costs, and

•

$0.3 million

related to other restructuring costs.

On January 16, 2001, we completed our merger with TelCom.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, we

exchanged each share of TelCom common stock for 0.795 of a share of our common

stock.  We issued 14,702,184 shares of

our common stock and assumed all outstanding TelCom stock options.  The transaction was structured as a tax-free

reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.


During the March 2001 quarter, we recognized a special charge of

$10.9 million for costs associated with the TelCom transaction.  These costs included:

•

$7.3 million

associated with investment banking fees

•

$1.6 million

associated with legal and accounting fees

•

$0.9 million of

severance costs, and

•

$1.1 million

related to other costs.

All reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal 2001

actions have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously

provided amounts.

Fiscal 2000

TelCom recorded restructuring charges in its quarter ended

March 31, 1999 of $0.3 million, primarily for employee severance

costs.  These charges have been reflected

in our fiscal 2000 operating results. 

All restructuring reserves relating to these charges have been fully

utilized.

Legal Settlement with Lucent Technologies Inc.

On January 13, 1998, we finalized a settlement of patent

litigation with Lucent Technologies Inc. 

Under the terms of the settlement, we made a one-time cash payment to

Lucent and issued to Lucent a warrant to acquire 1,012,500 shares of our common

stock at $7.48 per share.  We originally

assigned a value of $3.3 million to the warrant and recorded the amount in

accrued liabilities.  The warrant was

exercised by the holder in fiscal 2002, and the $3.3 million was reclassified

to additional paid-in capital and is now reflected in our Statement of Stockholders’

Equity and Other Comprehensive Income. 

The terms of the settlement also provided for a contingent payment to

Lucent if our earnings per share performance for the three and one-half year

period ended June 30, 2001 did not meet certain targeted levels.  Based on the estimate of earnings per share

for the measurement period as of March 31, 1999, we provided appropriate

reserves of approximately $3.6 million to meet this liability.  Due to the sale of the warrant by the holder

to a third party, the associated reserve became unnecessary and the $3.6

million special charge was reversed in the quarter ended September 30,

1999.

We also recorded a special charge related to other legal issues in the

amount of $1.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 1999.

All reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal 2000

actions have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously

provided amounts.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS

Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations contains certain forward-looking statements that involve

risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our strategy, financial

performance and revenue sources.  We use

words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “future,” “intend” and

similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.  Our actual results could differ materially

from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of

certain factors including those set forth in this Item 7, and under “Item 1 –

Business – Additional Factors That May Affect Our Results of Operations,”

beginning at page 11, above, and

elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Although

we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements

are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity,

performance or achievements.  You should

not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  We disclaim any obligation to update

information contained in any forward-looking statement.


We

begin our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations (MD&A) with a summary of Microchip’s overall business

strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the

overall direction of our business and products.  This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting

Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the

assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.  In the next section, beginning at page 26,

we discuss our Results of Operations for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003,

and for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. 

We then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash

flows, and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “Liquidity and

Capital Resources,” “Contractual Obligations” and “Off-Balance Sheet

Arrangements.”

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with other sections of this

Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1. Business”; “Item 6. Selected

Financial Data”; and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Strategy

Our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized

semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control

applications.  Our strategic focus is on

embedded control products, which include microcontrollers, high-performance

linear and mixed signal devices, power management and thermal management devices,

and complementary microperipheral products including interface devices, Serial

EEPROMs, and our patented KEELOQ

®

security devices.  We provide highly cost-effective embedded

control products that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance,

low voltage/power operation and ease of development, enabling timely and

cost-effective embedded control product integration by our customers.

Our manufacturing operations include wafer

fabrication and assembly and test.  The

ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our

business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing

control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded

control industry.  By owning our wafer

fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations, and by

employing proprietary statistical process control techniques, we have been able

to achieve and maintain high production yields.  Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten

our design and production cycles.  This

control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the

assembly and test profit margin.

We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in

developing our embedded control products. 

We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in

existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product

designs.  While many of our competitors

develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines,

we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile

memory products.  This allows us to more

fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new

products to market more rapidly.  Our

engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and software to

perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and

wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by

processing test wafers quickly and efficiently.

We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced

products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing

process technologies.  We believe these

investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive

position.  Our current research and

development activities focus on the design of new 8-bit microcontrollers,

16-bit digital signal controllers, memory and mixed-signal products, ASSPs, new

development systems, and software and application-specific software

libraries.  We are also developing new

design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and

performance improvements in existing products.

We market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct

sales personnel and distributors.  Our

distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support

requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors provide an effective means of

reaching this broad and diverse customer base. 

Our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in

three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently maintain sales and support

centers in major metropolitan areas in North America, Europe and Asia.  We believe that a strong technical service

presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control

market.  Many of our field sales

engineers (FSEs), field application engineers (FAEs), and sales management have

technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering

environment.  We believe that the

technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the

sale of our products.  The primary mission

of our FAE team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to

conduct periodic training sessions for FSEs and distributor sales teams.  FAEs also frequently conduct technical

seminars in major cities around the world, and work closely with our

distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and analysis of Microchip’s financial condition and

results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements,

which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally

accepted in the United States of America. 

We review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial

results on a regular basis.  The

preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and

judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and

expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,

including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes,

property plant and equipment, impairment of property, plant and equipment and

assets held for sale and litigation.  We

base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions

that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of

which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets

and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Results may differ from these estimates due

to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our

assumptions.  We review these estimates

and judgments on an ongoing basis.  We

believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant

judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial

statements.

Revenue

Recognition

We recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to OEMs.  We record reserves to cover the estimated

returns from OEM customers, which have historically been less than 1.5% of the

sales to these customers.  To the extent

rates of return change, our estimates for the reserves necessary to cover such

returns would also change.  Our

distributors worldwide have broad rights to return products and price

protection rights, so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells

the product to their customers.  We

reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions,

competitive considerations and other factors. 

Price protection is granted to third-party distributors on the inventory

that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered.  When we reduce the price of our products, it

allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts

receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as

of the date of the price reduction. 

There is no revenue impact from the price protections.  We also grant certain credits to our

third-party distributors.  The credits

are granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the

distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the

sale of our products to their end customers. 

The credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor

until they provide documentation of the sale to their end customer.  The effect of granting these credits

establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the product

and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the

distributors to their end customers.  Upon

shipment, amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable,

inventory is relieved, the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected

as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their

customers.  We changed our revenue

recognition policy as it relates to sales to Asia regional distributors during

fiscal 2003 as described below at page 36

and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements to conform with our

revenue recognition policies for our distribution channels in the Americas and

Europe.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the

first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  We

write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory

in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the

estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market

conditions.  If actual market conditions

are less favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs

may be required.  Inventory impairment

charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not

subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that

increased carrying amounts are recoverable. 

In estimating our reserves for obsolescence, we primarily evaluate

estimates of demand over a 12-month period and provide reserves for inventory

on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month demand.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial

statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the

jurisdictions in which we operate.  This

process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with

assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for

tax and accounting purposes.  These

differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included

within our consolidated balance sheet. 

We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be

recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to

the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a

valuation allowance.  We have not


provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is “more

likely than not” that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future

taxable income.  Should we determine

that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset

in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to

income in the period such determination was made.  At March 31, 2004, our gross deferred tax asset was $126.0

million.

Numerous taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business

are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by

businesses.  We believe that we maintain

adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise

upon audit in these countries.  If such

amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such

reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves

are no longer deemed necessary.  If such

amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment, a future

charge to expense would result.

The foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred

tax asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forward-looking

statements.  Actual results could differ

materially because of the following factors, among others: results of any audit

conducted by the various taxing authorities in the countries in which we do

business; the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will

be sufficient to realize the benefits available from our deferred tax assets;

current and future tax laws and regulations; and taxation rates in geographic

regions where we have significant operations.

Property, Plant

& Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are

capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.  At March 31, 2004, the carrying value

of our property and equipment totaled $689.2 million, which represents 42.5% of

our total assets.  This carrying value reflects

the application of our property and equipment accounting policies, which incorporate

estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of our

property and equipment.  Depreciation is

provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the

related assets, which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment

and approximately 30 years on buildings.

In April 2003, we announced our intention to close Fab 1 and

integrate certain Fab 1 personnel and processes into Fab 2.  We completed the integration process during

the quarter ended June 30, 2003, after which Fab 1 ceased to operate as a

wafer fabrication facility.  The closure

of Fab 1 and the integration of certain Fab 1 personnel into Fab 2 operations

resulted in a reduction in force of 207 employees.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we incurred accelerated

depreciation charges on the underlying assets and other expenses related to the

shut down of Fab 1 of approximately $30.6 million based upon a change in the

estimated life and recoverable value of the equipment used at Fab 1 that changed

based upon our decision to cease fabrication operations at this plant.

We began production activities at Fab 4 on October 31, 2003.  We began to depreciate the Fab 4 assets as

the assets were placed in service for production purposes.  As of March 31, 2004, all of the

buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the

manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service.  All manufacturing equipment that was not

being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and

is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management

believes there is no change to its utility from the present time until it is

placed into productive service.  The

lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at Fab 4 will be evaluated at

such time as the assets are placed in service. 

We do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired

the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets.

The estimates, assumptions and judgments we use in the application of

our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and

expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations.  The use of different estimates, assumptions

and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and

expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations, would likely

result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of

operations.

We do not currently hold title to the land on which our Thailand

facility resides.  The land is subject

to a complex restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land.  We have provided reserves that we estimate

will be adequate to obtain full title. 

Such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land.  However, timing of the resolution is

difficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change.


Impairment of

Property, Plant and Equipment and Assets Held for Sale

We assess whether indicators of impairment of

long-lived assets are present.  If such

indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated

undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their

carrying value.  If less, we recognize

an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets

over their respective fair values.  Fair

value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other

methods.  If the assets determined to be

impaired are to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a

charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated

net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying

value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the

asset. We may incur impairment losses, or additional losses on already impaired

assets, in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change.

Litigation

Our current estimated range of liability related to certain pending

litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate

the amount and range of loss.  Recorded

reserves were not significant at March 31, 2004.

Because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss

and the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation, we are

unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an

unfavorable outcome.  As additional

information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related

to our pending litigation and revise our estimates.  Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could

materially impact our results of operation and financial position.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage

of net sales for the years indicated:

Net Sales

We operate in one industry segment and engage

primarily in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of

semiconductor products.  We sell our

products to distributors and OEMs in a broad range of market segments, perform

on-going credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no

collateral.

Our net sales of $699.3 million in fiscal 2004

increased by $47.8 million, or 7.3%, over fiscal 2003, and net sales of $651.5

million in fiscal 2003 increased by $80.2 million, or 14.0%, over fiscal

2002.  The increases in net sales in

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002

resulted primarily from increased demand, predominantly for our proprietary

microcontroller products. Average selling prices for our products were down

approximately 9% in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 and 4% in fiscal 2003 over

fiscal 2002.  The number of units of our

products sold was up approximately 17% in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 and 18%

in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002.  The

average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the

mix of our products sold.  We believe

that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded

control market over the last three fiscal years.  Key factors in achieving the amount of net sales during the last

three fiscal years include:


•

continued market

share gains

•

increasing

semiconductor content in our customers’ products

•

our new product

offerings that have increased our served available market, and

•

increasing

demand for our products.

We recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to OEMs.  Under our shipping terms, legal title passes

to the customer upon shipment from Microchip. 

We have no post shipment obligations. 

Distributors worldwide generally have broad rights to return products

and price protection rights, so we defer revenue recognition until the

distributors sell the product to their customers.  Upon shipment, amounts billed to distributors are included in

accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, the sale is deferred and the gross margin

is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the

distributors to their customers.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, we changed our

accounting policy relating to amounts billed to customers for shipping and

handling costs to be consistent with EITF 00-10.  With this change, we have reclassified amounts billed to

customers for shipping and handling costs from a reduction of cost of sales to

revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004.  This reclassification had no impact on net income and an

immaterial impact on revenues and cost of sales.  Prior year amounts have not been reclassified, as these amounts

were immaterial.

Sales by product line for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004,

2003 and 2002 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform

the prior period amounts to the current period presentation.

Microcontrollers

Our microcontroller product line represents the

largest component of our total net sales. 

Microcontrollers and associated application development systems

accounted for approximately 79.6% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004,

approximately 79.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 and approximately

77.6% of our total net sales in fiscal 2002.

Net sales of our microcontroller products increased

approximately 8% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003, and increased approximately

17% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. 

The increases in net sales were primarily due to increased demand for

our microcontroller products in end markets, driven principally by market share

gains and those factors described above under “

Net Sales

” at page 26. 

The end markets that we serve include the automotive, communications,

computing, consumer and industrial control markets.

Historically, average selling prices in the

semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product.  The overall average selling prices of our

microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the

proprietary nature of these products. 

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate

pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines, primarily due to

competitive conditions.  We have been

able to in the past, and expect to be able to in the future, moderate average

selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new

products with more features at higher prices. 

We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our

microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the

future, which would adversely affect our operating results.


Memory Products

Sales of our memory products accounted for

approximately 13.1% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004, approximately 13.4%

of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 and approximately 15.0% of our total net

sales in fiscal 2002.

Net sales of our memory products increased

approximately 5% in fiscal 2004, compared to fiscal 2003, and increased

approximately 2% in fiscal 2003, compared to fiscal 2002, driven primarily by

customer demand conditions within the Serial EEPROM market, which products

comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales.

Serial EEPROM product pricing has historically been

cyclical in nature, with steep price declines followed by periods of relative

price stability, driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of

the business cycle.  During the past

three fiscal years, we have experienced several Serial EEPROM product pricing

trends due to market conditions.  We

experienced significant competitive downward pricing pressures in our Serial

EEPROM product lines during the first half of fiscal 2002, returning to modest

pricing declines in the second half of fiscal 2002.  We experienced modest pricing declines in our Serial EEPROM

product lines during fiscal 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal

2004.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal

2004 pricing for our Serial EEPROM product lines were approximately flat.  We have experienced, and expect to continue

to experience, varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our Serial

EEPROM products.  We may be unable to

maintain the average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM products as a result

of increased pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our

operating results.

Analog and Interface Products

Sales of our analog and interface products accounted

for approximately 7.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004, approximately

7.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 and approximately 7.4% of our total

net sales in fiscal 2002.

Net sales of our analog and interface products

increased approximately 6% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and increased

approximately 13% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002.  The increase in net sales of our analog and

interface products in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was driven primarily

by new proprietary design wins, supply and demand conditions within the market

and our ability to gain market share. 

Our net sales of analog and interface products within the telecommunications

sector, primarily in the cell phone market, were down approximately 31% in

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.  In

fiscal 2004, telecommunications represented approximately 16% of our sales of

analog and interface products compared to approximately 27% in fiscal 2003 and

32% in fiscal 2002.  Our net sales of

non-telecommunications analog and interface products were up approximately 31%

in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and up approximately 32% in fiscal 2003

compared to fiscal 2002.

Analog and interface products can be proprietary or non-proprietary

in nature.  Currently, we consider more

than half of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature,

where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability

experienced in our microcontroller products. 

The non-proprietary portion of our analog and interface business will

experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and

demand for those products.  During

fiscal 2004, our pricing of our non-proprietary analog and interface products

moderately increased compared to fiscal 2003. 

During fiscal 2003, pricing of our non-proprietary analog and interface

products was approximately flat compared to fiscal 2002.  We may be unable to maintain the average

selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased

pricing pressure in the future, which would adversely affect our operating

results.  We anticipate the proprietary

portion of our analog and interface products to increase over time.

Turns Orders

Our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a

combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for

shipment in that quarter, which we refer to as turns orders.  We measure turns orders at the beginning of

a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the revenue target that we set

entering the quarter.  We have

emphasized our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our

competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with short delivery

schedules.  Shorter lead times generally

mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in

any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product

shipments.  Turns orders correlate to

product lead times, which have extended during the December 2003 and

March 2004 quarters for many of our products.  With current lead times extending from their levels of the past

several years for many of our products, customers are beginning to place orders

with us extending beyond their immediate requirements.


The percentage of turns orders in any given quarter is dependent on

overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times.  As such, our percentage of turns orders

required in any particular quarter has fluctuated significantly over time.  During fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 and the

first three quarters of fiscal 2004, our turns orders were at the high end of

what we have experienced.  However, as

product lead times began to extend during the last two quarters of fiscal 2004,

we began to have improved visibility and a reduction in the percentage of turns

orders required.

Even with improved visibility, turns orders are

difficult to predict, and we may not experience the combination of turns orders

and shipments from backlog in a quarter that would be sufficient to achieve

anticipated net sales.  If we do not

achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter, our net

sales and operating results will suffer.

The foregoing statements regarding competitive pricing

pressure in our microcontroller, Serial EEPROM and analog and interface product

lines, our ability to moderate future average selling price declines in our

microcontroller product lines and the proprietary portion of our analog and

interface product lines increasing over time are forward-looking

statements.  Actual results could differ

materially because of the following factors, among others: the level of orders

that are received and can be shipped in a quarter; changes in demand for our

products and the products of our customers; the level and timing at which

previous design wins become actual orders and sales; inventory mix and timing

of customer orders; customers’ inventory levels, order patterns and

seasonality; level of sell-through of our products through distribution in any

particular fiscal period; our ability to ramp products into volume production;

competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability;

disruptions in commercial activities, or international transport or delivery

occasioned by terrorist activity, armed conflict, war or an unexpected increase

in the price of, or decrease in the supply of, oil resulting in reduced

end-user purchases relative to expectations; impact of events outside the United

States, such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or

political instability; the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry

and the markets addressed by our products; market acceptance of our new

products and those of our customers; the financial condition of our customers;

fluctuations in production yields, production efficiencies and overall capacity

utilization; changes in product mix; absorption of fixed costs, labor and other

fixed manufacturing costs; and general industry, economic and political

conditions.

Distribution

Distributors accounted for 64% of our net sales in

fiscal 2004, 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and 62% of our net sales in

fiscal 2002.

Our largest distributor accounted for approximately

13% of our net sales in fiscal 2004, 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and

14% of our net sales in fiscal 2002. 

Our two largest distributors accounted for 25% of our net sales in

fiscal 2004.

Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with

our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate their relationships

with us with little or no advanced notice. 

The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our

distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could

result in an increase in inventory returns.

At March 31, 2004, distributors were maintaining

an average of approximately 2.4 months of inventory of our products.  Over the past three fiscal years, the months

of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between

approximately 2.0 and 3.1 months.  Thus,

inventory levels at our distributors are at the low to moderate end of the

range we have experienced over the last three years.  With conditions in the semiconductor industry moving to extending

of current lead times we would expect distributors to increase current

inventory levels.  As we recognize

revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors, we do not believe

that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our

net sales.

Distributors generally have broad-based rights to

return product to us.  As revenue on

distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product

on to their end customers, distributor returns have no impact on revenue

recognition.

We also grant certain credits to our third-party

distributors and also offer these distributors price protection.  The credits are granted to the distributors

on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them

to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end

customers.  The credits are on a per

unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information

regarding the sale to their end customer. 

The effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price

from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue

recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end

customers.


We reduce product pricing through price protection

based on market conditions, competitive considerations and other factors.  Price protection is granted to third-party

distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection

is offered.  When we reduce the selling

price of our products, it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its

outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the

inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue recognition impact from

the price protections.

We do not offer material incentive programs to our

third-party distributors.

The foregoing statements regarding our expectation that

distributors will increase their current inventory levels and our belief that

inventory holding patterns at our distributors will not materially impact our

net sales are forward-looking statements. 

Actual results could differ materially because of the following factors,

among others: the rate of recovery in the overall economy and the uncertainty

of current economic and political conditions; changes in demand for our

products and the products of our customers; the level and timing at which

previous design wins become actual orders and sales; inventory mix and timing

of customer orders; customers’ inventory levels, order patterns and

seasonality; the impact on our business and customer order patterns due to

major public health concerns, such as the SARS virus; level of sell-through of

our products through distribution in any particular fiscal period; disruptions

in commercial activities, or international transport or delivery occasioned by

terrorist activity, armed conflict, war or an unexpected increase in the price

of, or decrease in the supply of, oil resulting in reduced end-user purchases

relative to expectations; impact of events outside the United States, such as

the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political

instability; the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the

markets addressed by our products; market acceptance of our new products and

those of our customers; and the financial condition of our customers.

Sales by Geography

Sales by geography for the fiscal years ended

March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Our sales to foreign customers have been predominately

in Asia and Europe, which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those

areas for automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial

control products.  Americas sales

include sales to customers in the United States, Canada, Central America and

South America.  Sales to customers in

Asia have increased during the last three fiscal years due to lower

manufacturing costs and developing markets in Asia, particularly China.

Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately

71% of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and approximately 69% of

our net sales in fiscal 2002.  The

majority of our foreign sales are U.S. Dollar denominated.

Sales to customers in China, including Hong Kong,

accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and

approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.  We did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10%

of our net sales during the periods covered by this report.

Gross Profit

Our

gross profit was $350.0 million in fiscal 2004, $352.2 million in fiscal 2003

and $286.7 million in fiscal 2002. 

Gross profit as a percent of sales was 50.0% in fiscal 2004, 54.1% in

fiscal 2003 and 50.2% in fiscal 2002.

The most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage over the

past three fiscal years were:

•

Improvements in

capacity utilization and product absorption, which positively affected gross

margin by $10.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003, and by

$27.1 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002.


•

$31.8 million in

accelerated depreciation and other costs associated with the closure of Fab 1,

which negatively affected gross margin, in fiscal 2004.

•

Increases in

non-capitalized expenses in Fab 3 and Fab 4, our non-operational facilities,

for portions of the periods covered by this report, which negatively affected

gross margin.  Non-capitalized expenses

amounted to $18.1 million

in fiscal 2004, $13.1 million in fiscal

2003 and $6.4 million in fiscal 2002.

•

A one-week

unpaid shutdown negatively affecting gross profit by $1.7 million in fiscal

2004.  The shutdown occurred in the

three months ended September 30, 2003 and had a negative impact on gross

profit due to the fact that certain fixed costs including depreciation,

utilities, property taxes and other ongoing costs continued when the factory

was shut down.  There were no shutdowns

in fiscal 2003.  There were three

shutdowns in fiscal 2002, that negatively affected gross profit by a total of

$5.0

million.  Two of the fiscal 2002 shutdowns were unpaid

which lessened the unfavorable impact on gross profit.

Other factors that impacted gross profit percentage in the periods

covered by this report include:

•

continued cost

reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such as new

manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques

•

varying factors

impacting the average selling prices of our products

•

fluctuations in

the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and analog products and related

Serial EEPROM products, and

•

inventory

write-offs and the sale of inventory that was previously written off.

During fiscal 2002, we operated at approximately 70%

of our cumulative total Fab 1 and Fab 2 capacity due to capacity reductions

implemented in the March 2001 quarter and one-week plant shutdowns in each

quarter of fiscal 2002.  Our overall

gross margins in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by these actions due to

the relatively high fixed costs inherent in our wafer fabrication

manufacturing.  During fiscal 2003, we operated

at approximately 85% of our cumulative total Fab 1 and Fab 2 capacity, which

favorably impacted gross margins, compared to fiscal 2002.  During fiscal 2004, we operated at

approximately 91% of our Fab 2

capacity, which favorably impacted gross margins, compared to fiscal 2003.  We are in the early stages of ramping our

production activities at Fab 4.

The process technologies utilized impact our gross

margins.  Fab 2 currently utilizes

various manufacturing process technologies, but predominantly utilizes our 0.5

to 1.0 micron processes.  Fab 4

currently utilizes our 0.5 micron process technology.  We continue to transition products to more advanced process

technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.  Since the closure of Fab 1 in June 2003, all of our

production has been on 8-inch wafers. 

In fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, approximately 80% of our production was

on 8-inch wafers.

Our overall inventory levels were $94.5 million at

March 31, 2004, compared to $102.3 million at March 31, 2003 and $88.6

million at March 31, 2002.  We had

101 days of inventory on our balance sheet at March 31, 2004, compared to

128 days at March 31, 2003 and 110 days at March 31, 2002.

We anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate

over time, driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller,

analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of

each of these products in a particular quarter, as well as manufacturing

yields, fixed cost absorption, wafer fab loading levels and competitive and

economic conditions.

The foregoing statements relating to our transition to more

advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs and the

fluctuation of gross margins over time are forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially

because of the following factors, among others: changes in demand for our

products and the products of our customers; fluctuations in production yields,

production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization; changes in capacity

utilization; absorption of fixed costs, labor and other direct manufacturing

costs; competition and competitive pressure on pricing; disruptions in

commercial activities, or international transport or delivery occasioned by

terrorist activity, armed conflict, war or an unexpected increase in the price

of, or decrease in the supply of, oil resulting in reduced end-user purchases

relative to expectations; impact of events outside the United States, such as

the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political

instability; our ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed; cost and

availability of raw materials; changes in product mix; and other general

industry, economic and political conditions.


At March 31, 2004, approximately 71% of our assembly requirements

were being performed in our Thailand facility, compared to approximately 77% as

of March 31, 2003 and approximately 53% at March 31, 2002.  Third-party contractors located throughout

Asia perform the balance of our assembly operations.  Substantially all of our test requirements were being performed

in our Thailand facility over the last three fiscal years.  As of April 30, 2004, we had

substantially completed a 67,000 square foot expansion area at our Thailand

facility that, once placed in service, will increase the facility’s test

capacity by approximately 80%.  The

expansion area is expected to be placed in service in fiscal 2005.  We believe that the assembly and test operations

performed at our Thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings

when compared to third-party contractor assembly and test costs, as well as

increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process.

Our use of third parties involves some reduction in

our level of control over the portions of our business that we

subcontract.  While we review the

quality, delivery and cost performance of our third-party contractors, our

future operating results could suffer if any third-party contractor is unable

to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at

approximately their current levels.

Research and Development (R&D)

R&D expenses for fiscal 2004 were $85.4 million,

or 12.2% of sales, compared to $88 million, or 13.5% of sales, for fiscal 2003,

and $81.7 million, or 14.3% of sales, for fiscal 2002.  We are committed to investing in new and

enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design

and manufacturing process technologies. 

We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our

competitive position.  We expense all

R&D costs as incurred.  R&D

expenses include expenditures for labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers,

and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and

software to support new products and design environments.

R&D expenses decreased $2.6 million, or 3.0%, for

fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003.  The

primary reasons for the dollar decrease in R&D costs in fiscal 2004

compared to fiscal 2003 were reductions in professional services and lower

costs associated with product prototyping which were partially offset by

increases in labor costs.

R&D

expenses increased $6.3 million, or 7.7%, for fiscal 2003 over fiscal

2002.  The primary reason for the dollar

increase in R&D costs in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was increased labor

and professional service costs associated with expanding our technical

resources and the ongoing R&D expenses acquired as part of the acquisition

of PowerSmart, Inc. described at “

Special Charges – Fiscal 2003 – PowerSmart In-Process

Research and Development Charge

,” below at page 34. 

R&D expenses would have been higher in fiscal 2002 if we had not

implemented unpaid one-week shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of

fiscal 2002.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses for

fiscal 2004 were $92.4 million, or 13.2% of sales, compared to

$89.4 million, or 13.7% of sales, for fiscal 2003 and $82.6 million, or

14.5% of sales, for fiscal 2002. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses

related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and

promotional expenditures and legal expenses. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related

to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales

offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection

and use of our products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased

$3.1 million, or 3.4%, for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003.  The primary reasons for the dollar increase

in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003

were increases in labor costs and travel expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.7

million, or 8.2%, for fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002.  The primary reason for the dollar increase in selling, general

and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 relate to increased

labor costs due to increases in headcount, salaries and bonuses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time,

primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Special Charges

The following table presents a summary of special charges for the

fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003.  There were no special charges incurred during fiscal 2002:


Fiscal 2004

Fab 1 Closure and Special Charges

On April 7, 2003, we announced our intention to close our

Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1) wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain Fab

1 personnel and processes into our Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) wafer fabrication

facility.  We completed this integration

process during the three-month period ended June 30, 2003.  The closure of Fab 1 and the integration of

certain Fab 1 personnel into Fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force

of 207 employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing operations

or provided support to Fab 1.  The

detail of the charges incurred related to the closure of Fab 1 that were

included in cost of sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003

is as follows (amounts in thousands):

For the quarter ended June 30, 2003, operating expense included

$1,612,000 of special charges recorded principally for contract cancellation,

severance and other costs related to the closure of Fab 1 and other

actions.  We incurred $865,000 of such

expenditures during fiscal 2004.  We reversed

$747,000 of the special charges recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2003

in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 as a result of a favorable outcome

in the settlement of a contract cancellation.

The facility where Fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall

campus in Chandler, Arizona.  Within

this same facility resides our wafer probe, mask making and other manufacturing

related activities.  The accelerated

depreciation that was taken only related to assets used in the wafer

fabrication operations at the facility. 

We have no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the

wafer fabrication operations, and intend to leave it in an idle status.  The property, plant and equipment that was

subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and accumulated

depreciation carrying values in the property, plant and equipment

section of our balance sheet and related footnote disclosures.

Fiscal 2003

Fab 3 Impairment Charge

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)

issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS 144”), “

Accounting

for the

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,”

which is applicable to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after

December 15, 2001.  SFAS 144

provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of and

significantly changes the criteria that must be met to classify an asset as

held-for-sale.  Classification as

held-for-sale is an important distinction because assets held-for-sale are not

depreciated and are stated at the lower of book value or fair value less cost

to sell.  SFAS 144 is effective for all

of our financial statements issued subsequent to April 1, 2002.  In accordance with SFAS 144, we recorded a

$41.5 million asset impairment charge during the quarter ended

September 30, 2002, as described below.


We acquired Fab 3, a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Puyallup,

Washington, in July 2000.  The

original purchase consisted of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real

property.  It was our intention to bring

Fab 3 to productive readiness and commence volume production of 8-inch wafers

using our 0.7 and 0.5 micron process technologies by August 2001.  We delayed our production start up at Fab 3

due to deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor industry during

fiscal 2002.  Fab 3 has never been

brought to productive readiness.

On August 23, 2002, we acquired Fab 4, a semiconductor

manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon. 

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page F-10, below.  We decided to purchase Fab 4 instead of bringing Fab 3 to

productive readiness because, among other things, the cost of the manufacturing

equipment needed to ramp production at Fab 3 over the next several years

was significantly higher than the total purchase price of Fab 4, and the time

to bring Fab 4 to productive readiness was significantly less than the time

required to bring Fab 3 to productive readiness.

After the acquisition of Fab 4 was completed, we undertook an analysis

of the potential production capacity at Fab 4. 

The results of the production capacity analysis led us to determine that

Fab 3’s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the

September 2002 quarter we committed to a plan to sell Fab 3.  We have retained a third-party broker to

market Fab 3 on our behalf. 

Accordingly, Fab 3 was classified as an asset held-for-sale as of

September 30, 2002 and maintained that classification at March 31,

2004 given management’s continued intent to sell the facility within the next

twelve months.

Management determined the value assigned to the assets through various

methods including assistance from a third-party appraisal.  The independent third party used the market

approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair

value of Fab 3.  The comparable sales

included eight properties, including our purchases of Fab 3 in July 2000

and Fab 4 in August 2002.  Based on

the results of this appraisal, we recorded an asset impairment charge on

Fab 3 of $36.9 million, including estimated costs to sell.  The remaining value of $60.2 million is

classified as an asset held-for-sale and is included as a component of other

current assets at March 31, 2004.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we also recorded an

asset impairment charge of $4.6 million to write-down certain excess

manufacturing equipment located at Fab 3 to its net realizable value of $0.2

million.  This manufacturing equipment

became “excess” as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of

Fab 4.  The net realizable value for the

excess manufacturing equipment was determined based on management

estimates.  Substantially all of the

other manufacturing equipment located at Fab 3 has been transferred to and will

be used in our other wafer fabrication facilities located in Tempe, Arizona

(Fab 2) and Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).

If actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated in

the appraisal, or if future market conditions deteriorate, the net proceeds

from the assets held-for-sale could be less than the amount estimated in the

financial statements and additional charges could result prior to or at the

time of the sale of Fab 3.  However, as

of March 31, 2004 management did not believe that Fab 3 was recorded in

excess of its recoverable value based on an assessment of existing market

conditions.

PowerSmart In-Process Research and

Development Charge

During the quarter ended June 30, 2002, purchased in-process

research and development of $9.3 million associated with our acquisition of

PowerSmart, Inc. was written off at the date of the acquisition (June 5,

2002) in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “

Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2,

Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method”

(FIN

4).  PowerSmart delivered a battery

management whole product solution that improves system runtimes with a lower

system cost for the user.  Included in

the whole product solution is an application tools suite designed to speed up

implementation during the user’s development and production.  The acquisition was intended to strengthen

our position in battery management applications such as laptop computers,

personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras and

camcorders.

The assets acquired included in-process research and development for

which there is no alternative future uses. 

Management determined the value assigned to this asset through various

methods including assistance from third party appraisal firms in valuing the

PowerSmart business.  As of the

valuation date, there were 15 projects that were considered to be in

process.  The values of the projects

were determined based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by

the products that are expected to result from the in-process projects.  These cash flows were estimated by

forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting

appropriate operating expenses, cash flow adjustments and contributory asset

returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the in-process

technology.  These net returns were

substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the

risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving

commercial readiness.  The


above analysis resulted in $9.3 million of value assigned to acquired

in-process research and development, which was expensed on the acquisition date

in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement

No. 2 Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method.”  We believe the assumptions used in valuing

in-process research and development are reasonable, but are inherently

uncertain.  Since the date of the

purchase, we incurred development costs of approximately $4.1 million related

to the acquired in-process research and development, and should the projects

continue to move toward commercialization, we estimate that future expenditures

could approximate $0.6 million over the next fiscal year.  As of March 31, 2004, four

of

the in-process research and development projects had been completed, six had

been postponed and five projects continue to be in-process.  We expect the six in-process projects to be

completed in fiscal 2005 or before.

The foregoing statements relating to our estimated future expenditures

on the acquired in-process R&D projects and expected completion dates for

R&D projects are forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially because of the following

factors, among others: delays in completion of a particular project; changes in

our prioritization of projects; changes in the specifications of a particular

project; unforeseen engineering problems; and unanticipated costs.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest income in fiscal 2004 increased from interest income in fiscal

2003 as our average invested cash balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2004

compared to fiscal 2003.  Interest

income in fiscal 2003 decreased from interest income in fiscal 2002 as our

average invested cash balances and the interest rates applicable to our

invested cash balances were lower in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and

federal and state tax on our U.S. earnings. 

Our effective tax rate was 22.8% in fiscal 2004, 22.3% in fiscal 2003

and 25.5% in fiscal 2002, and is lower than statutory rates in the United

States due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations and R&D

tax credits.  The decreases in our

effective tax rates in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 were

due to the impairment portion of the special charges in fiscal 2003 and the

accelerated depreciation and other charges associated with the closure of Fab 1

in fiscal 2004, which provided an income tax benefit at a greater rate than our

historic effective rate given the 40% tax jurisdiction in which the charges

occurred.  These charges impacted our

effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 by approximately 270 basis points and our

effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 by approximately 300 basis points.

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial

statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the

jurisdictions in which we operate.  This

process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, together with

assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for

tax and accounting purposes.  These

differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included

within our consolidated balance sheet. 

We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be

recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and, to

the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a

valuation allowance.  We have not

provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that our deferred tax

asset will be recovered from future taxable income.  Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or

part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred

tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was

made.  At March 31, 2004 our gross

deferred tax asset was $126.0 million.

Various taxing authorities in the United States and other countries in

which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures

employed by businesses.  Companies of

our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the

jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations.  We are currently under audit by the United

States Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years ended March 31, 1998,

1999, 2000 and 2001.  We believe that we

maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may

arise upon audit in the United States and other countries in which we do

business.  If such amounts ultimately

prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result

in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed

necessary.  If such amounts ultimately

prove to be less than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would

be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined.


Our Thailand manufacturing operations

currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by

the Thailand government based on our investments in property, plant and

equipment in Thailand.  Although our tax

holidays in Thailand partially expired in October 2003, our manufacturing

operations in Thailand are being predominantly conducted using equipment that

was invested pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until

September 2006.  The expiration of

a portion of our tax holiday in Thailand did not have a material impact on our

effective tax rate in fiscal 2004.

The foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred

tax asset from our future taxable income, and the adequacy of our tax reserves

to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit are

forward-looking statements.  Actual

results could differ materially because of the following factors, among others:

current and future tax laws and regulations; taxation rates in geographic

regions where we have significant operations; results of any current or future

audit conducted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing

authorities in the countries in which we do business; and the level of our

taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize our

deferred tax asset.

Change in Accounting Principle

We had historically recognized revenue from sales to our

Americas, European and multinational Asian distributors at Point of Sale (POS),

or when those distributors sell our products to their customers, and, prior to

fiscal 2003, we recognized revenue on sales to regional Asian distributors at

Point of Purchase (POP), or when we shipped product to these distributors.   Upon shipment, amounts billed to

distributors at POS are included as accounts receivable, inventory is relieved,

the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability

until the product is sold by the distributor to its customers.

On March 18, 2003, we announced that we would change

our revenue recognition policy relating to regional Asian distributors from POP

to POS.   We believe that revenue

recognition at POS for sales to distributors as our sole revenue recognition

policy worldwide is a more reflective measure of end customer demand for our

products.  To implement the change in

revenue recognition, we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in

accounting principle of $11.4 million (net of income taxes of $6.6 million) as

of April 1, 2002, the beginning of fiscal 2003.  The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was

calculated by multiplying the quantity of our inventory that the regional Asia

distributors maintained as of April 1, 2002 by the gross margin we would

realize on those sales, net of related income tax.  We restated our quarterly results for fiscal 2003 to conform to

the change in accounting principle and have included the restated amounts at

Note 23 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We had $474.5 million in cash, cash

equivalents and short-term investments at March 31, 2004, an increase of

$258.0 million from the March 31, 2003 balance. The increase in cash,

cash equivalents and short-term investments over this time period is primarily

attributable to our cash flows generated from operations.

During fiscal 2004, we maintained an unsecured short-term line of

credit with various financial institutions in Asia, which at March 31,

2004 totaled $5 million (U.S. Dollar equivalent).  There were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of

March 31, 2004, but an allocation of approximately $0.6 million of the

available line was made, relating to import guarantees associated with our

business in Thailand.  There are no

covenants related to the foreign line of credit.

Net cash provided from operating activities was $343.1 million for

fiscal 2004, $260.2 million for fiscal 2003 and $178.8 million for fiscal 2002.

The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to our results of

operations after consideration of non-cash special charges, increases in

accounts payable and accrued liabilities and decreases in inventory.

Net cash used in investing activities was $267.6 million for fiscal

2004, $376.8 million for fiscal 2003 and $138.7 million in fiscal 2002.  The decrease in cash used in investing

activities in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the purchases

of Fab 4 and PowerSmart that occurred in fiscal 2003.

We enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to

minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations.  Although none of the countries in which we conduct significant

foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five

years, there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign

currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely

affect our operating results in the future. 

There were no hedges outstanding as of March 31, 2004.


Our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result

of actual and anticipated business conditions. 

Capital expenditures were $63.5 million in fiscal 2004, $265.1 million

in fiscal 2003 and $44.7 million in fiscal 2002.  The primary reason for the dollar decrease in capital

expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was a reduced need for

additional capital equipment as a result of our purchase of Fab 4 during fiscal

2003.  The primary reasons for the

dollar increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002

were the purchase of Fab 4, other selective investments to increase our

manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and our continued

investment in R&D equipment.  We

currently intend to spend approximately $75 million during the next 12 months

to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain, and selectively increase,

capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs.

We expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash

balances and cash flows from operations. 

We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over

the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our

currently anticipated needs.

Net cash used in financing activities was $24.1

million for fiscal 2004 and $3.1 million for fiscal 2003.  Net cash provided by financing activities

was $16.1 million in fiscal 2002. 

Proceeds from the sale of stock, the exercise of stock options and

employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were $53.2 million

for fiscal 2004, $31.5 million for fiscal 2003 and $43.8 million for fiscal

2002.  Cash expended for the repurchase

of our common stock was $53.9 million in fiscal 2004, $26.5 million in fiscal

2003 and $27.8 million in fiscal 2002.

On August 7, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the

repurchase of up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or

in privately negotiated transactions. 

As of March 31, 2004, we had repurchased the entire 2,500,000

common share authorization for a total of $59.3 million.  On March 11, 2004, our Board of

Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of our

common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As of March 31, 2004, we had

repurchased 1,200,100 common shares under this authorization for a total of

$31.2 million.  As of March 31,

2004, all but 1,967,508 of the purchased shares under both authorizations had

been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee

stock purchase plan.  The timing and

amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and

corporate considerations.  On

April 22, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

an additional 2,500,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in

privately negotiated transactions.

On October 28, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had

approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.  The initial quarterly dividend of $0.02 per

share was paid on December 6, 2003 in the amount of

$4.0 million.  We have continued to

pay quarterly dividends and have increased the amount of such dividends on a

regular basis.  During fiscal 2004, we

paid dividends in the amount of $0.113

per share for a total dividend payment of

$23.3 million.

We maintained a net shares settled forward contract during the year

ended March 31, 2002.  During

fiscal 2002, we made a net delivery of 572,645 shares of our common stock.  We also received approximately $14.1 million

in connection with an early termination covering 1,650,000 of the shares

outstanding under the net shares settled forward contract.  We closed out the net shares settled forward

contract in its entirety on January 15, 2002 and made a cash payment of

$27.8 million to purchase the remaining 1,610,606 shares outstanding under the

contract.  The purchased shares were

held as treasury shares and were used to fund stock option exercises and

purchases under our employee stock purchase plan through April 9, 2002.

We believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash

generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated

cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  However, the semiconductor industry is capital intensive.  In order to remain competitive, we must

constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital

equipment for both production and research and development.  We may seek additional equity or debt

financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and

product assembly and test facilities, or for other purposes.  The timing and amount of any such financing

requirements will depend on a number of factors, including demand for our

products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, and competitive

factors.  There can be no assurance that

such financing will be available on acceptable terms, and any additional equity

financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing

stockholders.

The foregoing statements regarding our

anticipated level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months, the nature

of such expenditures, the financing and sufficiency of our capital expenditures

and our belief that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet

our requirements are forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially because of the following

factors, among others: changes in demand for our products and those of our

customers; changes in utilization of current manufacturing capacity;

unanticipated costs in continuing to ramp production at Fab 4;our ability to

increase


production at Fab 2; market acceptance of

our products and of our customers’ products; the cyclical nature of the

semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products; the

availability and cost of raw materials, equipment and other supplies; actual

levels of capital expenditures; the costs and outcome of any litigation

involving intellectual property, customer or other issues; the financial

condition of our customers and vendors; uninsured losses; and the economic,

political and other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us.

Contractual

Obligations

The following table

summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March 31, 2004, and

the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash

flows in future periods.  This table

excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities

at March 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Capital

purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchase or

property, plant and equipment.  They are

not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2004, as

we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.

(2)

Other

purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types

of licenses.

(3)

Total

contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on the

balance sheet as current liabilities, or certain purchase obligations as

discussed below.

Purchase orders or

contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are

not included in the table above.  We are

not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that

represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent

authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  For the purpose of this table, contractual

obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that

are enforceable and legally binding on Microchip and that specify all

significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased;

fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the

transaction.  Our purchase orders are

based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with

short time horizons.  We do not have

significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods

specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected

requirements for three months.  We also

enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under

these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain

clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.

The expected

timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on

current information.  Timing of payments

and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of

goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet

Arrangements

We do not have any transactions, arrangements and other relationships

with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity

or capital resources.  We have no special

purpose or limited purpose entities that provided off-balance sheet financing,

liquidity or market or credit risk support, engage in leasing, hedging,

research and development services, or other relationships that expose us to

liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements.  See Note 18 of the financial statements

regarding our lease commitments.


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN

46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB

No. 51,” which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable

interest entities (“VIEs”) either:  (1)

that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to

finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or

(2) in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a

controlling financial interest.  In

December 2003, the FASB completed deliberations of proposed modifications

to FIN 46 (“Revised Interpretations”) resulting in multiple effective dates

based on the nature as well as the creation date of the VIE.  VIEs created after January 31, 2003,

but prior to January 1, 2004, may be accounted for either based on the

original interpretation or the Revised Interpretations.  For VIEs created or acquired prior to

February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first

interim or annual period ending after December 15, 2003.  Certain disclosures are effective

immediately.  VIEs created after

January 1, 2004 must be accounted for under the Revised Interpretations.  We currently have no contractual

relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and

therefore the adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have an effect on the consolidated

financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)

issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 149, “Amendment

of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which is

generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30,

2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003.  SFAS No. 149 clarifies under what

circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the

characteristic of a derivative as discussed in SFAS No. 133, clarifies when a

derivative contains a financing component, amends the definition of an “underlying”

to conform it to the language used in FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect

Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” and amends certain other existing

pronouncements.  We do not have any

derivative financial instruments.  The

adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have any impact on our consolidated balance

sheets or statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain

Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and

Equity.”  This Statement requires that

certain instruments that were previously classified as equity on a company’s

statement of financial position now be classified as liabilities.  The Statement is effective for financial

instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and to all other

instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial

reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003.  We have no instruments impacted by the adoption of this statement

and therefore the adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have an effect on our

consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our investment portfolio, consisting of fixed income securities that we

hold on an available-for-sale basis, was $462.9 million as of March 31,

2004, and $208.7 million as of March 31, 2003.  These securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject

to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates

increase.  We have the ability to hold

our fixed income investments until maturity and, therefore, we would not expect

to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market

interest rates increase.  The following

table provides information about our available-for-sale securities that are

sensitive to changes in interest rates. 

We have aggregated our available-for-sale securities for presentation

purposes since they are all very similar in nature (dollars in thousands):

We have international operations and are thus subject to foreign

currency rate fluctuations.  To date,

our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant.  Approximately 99% of our sales are

denominated in U.S. dollars.  At times

we maintain hedges of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a

foreign operation.  The amounts of the

hedges outstanding as of March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003 were

immaterial.  If foreign currency rates

fluctuate by 15% from the rates at March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003,

the effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be

material.


During the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a

variety of market risks, examples of which include, but are not limited to,

interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations, as we discuss in

this Item 7A, and collectability of accounts receivable.  We continuously assess these risks and have

established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of

these and other potential exposures. 

Although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas,

no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these

areas in the future.

REPORT OF ERNST
& YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and

Stockholders of Microchip Technology Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Microchip Technology Incorporated and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2004
and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity and other comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended March 31, 2004. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Microchip Technology Incorporated and subsidiaries at March 31, 2004 and
2003 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2004, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for sales to Asian regional
distributors effective April 1, 2002.

SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature
of Business

Microchip develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products
used by its customers for a wide variety of embedded control applications.  Microchip’s product portfolio comprises the PICmicro

®

field–programmable
RISC microcontrollers, which serve 8 and 16-bit embedded control applications,
and a broad spectrum of high-performance linear and mixed-signal, power
management and thermal management devices. 
Microchip also offers complementary microperipheral products including
interface devices, Serial EEPROMs, and application-specific standard products
(ASSPs).  This synergistic product
portfolio targets thousands of applications and a growing demand for
high-performance designs in the automotive, communications, computing, consumer
and industrial control markets.

Principles
of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Microchip Technology Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Microchip”
or the “Company”).  The Company does not
have any subsidiaries in which it does not own 100% of the outstanding
stock.  All of the Company’s
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Change
in Accounting Principle

On March 18, 2003, the Company announced that it would
change its revenue recognition policy relating to regional Asian distributors
from Point of Purchase (POP), or when the Company ships product to these
distributors, to Point of Sale (POS), or when those distributors sell the
Company’s products to their customers. 
The change in accounting principle is preferable because: (i) it better
reflects the substance of end customer demand for the Company’s products, and
will better focus the Company on, and allow investors to better understand, end
user demand trends for its products; (ii) it provides uniformity in the revenue
recognition policy of the Company; and (iii) the new accounting method is
consistent with other companies in the semiconductor industry and, therefore,
provides greater comparability in the presentation of financial results among
the Company and its peers.  To implement
the change in revenue recognition, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle charge of $11.4 million (net of income taxes of
$6.6 million) as of April 1, 2002.

Revenue
Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to
OEMs.  For sales recorded upon shipment,
the Company records reserves for estimated customer returns.  Distributors worldwide generally have broad
rights to return products and price protection rights, so the Company defers
revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their
customer.  The Company reduces product
pricing through price protection based on market conditions, competitive
considerations and other factors.  Price
protection is granted to third-party distributors on the inventory that they
have on hand at the date the price protection is offered.  When the Company reduces the price of its
products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding
accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on
hand as of the date of the price reduction. 
There is no revenue impact from the price protections.  The Company also grants certain credits to
its third-party distributors.  The
credits are granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the
distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the
sale of the Company’s products to their end customers.  The credits are on a per unit basis and are
not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale
to their end customer.  The effect of
granting these credits establishes the net selling price from the Company to
its distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by
the Company when the product is sold by the distributors to their end
customers.  Upon shipment, amounts
billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable, inventory is
relieved, the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current
liability until the product is sold by the distributor to its customers or
returned.

Product Warranty

The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty of product
quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual
property infringement claims related to the Company’s products.  The accrual and the related expense for known
issues were not significant as of and for the fiscal years presented.  Due to product

F-6

testing, the short time between product shipment and the detection and
correction of product failures, and a low historical rate of payments on
indemnification claims, the accrual based on historical activity and the
related expense were not significant as of and for the fiscal years presented.

Research
and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Research and development expenses include
expenditures for labor, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for development
of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and
design environments.

Advertising
Costs

The Company expenses all advertising costs as
incurred.  Advertising costs were not
material in the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Foreign
Currency Translation and Forward Contracts

The Company’s foreign subsidiaries are considered to be
extensions of the U.S. Company and any translation gains and losses related to
these subsidiaries are included in other income and expense.  As the U.S. Dollar is utilized as the functional
currency, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
(transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional
currency) are also included in income. 
Gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on forward
contracts are recorded currently in income. 
These gains and losses have historically been immaterial to the
Company’s financial statements.

Income
Taxes

As part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial
statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the
jurisdictions in which it operates. 
This process involves estimating the Company’s actual current tax
exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
which are included within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.  The Company must then assess the likelihood
that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and
to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a
valuation allowance.  The Company has
not provided for a valuation allowance because management currently believes
that it is “more likely than not” that its deferred tax assets will be recovered
from future taxable income.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments, including marketable
securities purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less when
acquired are considered to be cash equivalents.

Short-Term Investments

The Company accounts for investments under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities.”  The Company’s
investments are classified as available-for-sale. The Company defines
short-term investments as income yielding securities, which can be readily
converted to cash. Short-term investments consist of state student loan bonds,
fixed rate annuity contracts, corporate preferred stock and bank certificates
of deposits. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair
value. Realized gains and losses are included in interest income. The cost of
securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments,
which is included in bad debt expense. 
The Company determines the adequacy of this allowance by regularly
reviewing the composition of its accounts receivable aging and evaluating
individual customer receivables, considering such customer’s financial
condition, credit history and current economic conditions.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  The
Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable
inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and
market conditions.  If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional
inventory write-downs may be required. 
Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory
and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later
suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable.  In estimating reserves for obsolescence, the
Company primarily evaluates estimates of demand over a 12-month period and
provides reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month
demand.

F-7

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized,
while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.  The Company’s property and equipment
accounting policies incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments relative
to the useful lives of its property and equipment.  Depreciation is provided for assets placed in service on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relative assets,
which range from 3 to 30 years.  The
Company evaluates the carrying value of its property and equipment when events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may
be impaired.  Asset impairment
evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective.

Litigation

The Company’s estimated range of liability related to certain pending
litigation is based on claims for which management believes a loss is probable
and it can estimate the amount or range of loss.  Because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range
of the loss on the remaining pending litigation, the Company is unable to make
a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable
outcome.  As additional information
becomes available, the Company will assess the potential liability related to
its pending litigation and revise its estimates.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” the Company does not amortize goodwill.  In lieu of amortization, the Company is required to perform an
annual impairment review, and more frequently under certain circumstances.  The goodwill is subjected to this test
during the fourth quarter of the Company’s fiscal year.  The Company engages primarily in the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products and, as a
result, the Company concluded there is one reporting unit.  If the Company determines through the
impairment process that goodwill has been impaired, the Company will record the
impairment charge in the statement of income. 
As of March 31, 2004, there was no impairment charge related to
goodwill.  There can be no assurance
that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to
earnings.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses whether indicators of
impairment of long-lived assets are present. 
If such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum
of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question
is less than their carrying value.  If
less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the
carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values.  Fair value is determined by discounted
future cash flows, appraisals or other methods.  If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used,
the Company recognizes an impairment loss through a charge to operating results
to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to
the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value, which the Company
depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.

Equity
Derivative Instruments

The Company has utilized a net share settled forward contract for the
sale and repurchase of common stock. 
Amounts paid and proceeds received from this instrument are recorded as
components of additional paid-in capital. 
The Company closed out the net shares settled forward contract in its
entirety on January 15, 2002.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Prior to April 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock option
plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”

and related
interpretations.  As such, compensation
expense would be recorded for grants to employees and directors only if, on the
date of grant, the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
exercise price and such expense would be recorded on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period.  On April 1,
1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

(“SFAS
No. 123”) which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting
period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant.  Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows
entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide
pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee
stock option grants made in fiscal 1996 and subsequent years as if the
fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.  The Company has elected to continue to apply
the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and to provide the pro forma disclosure

F-8

provisions of SFAS No. 123.  The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
to employee stock benefits, including shares issued under the stock option
plans and under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (amounts in
thousands, except per share data):

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of
stock-based compensation plans and other options is amortized to expense
primarily over the vesting period.  See
Note 17 for further discussion of the Company’s stock-based employee
compensation.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in debt
securities and trade receivables.  The
Company generally places its investments with high-credit quality
counterparties and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
counterparty based on the Company’s analysis of that counterparty’s relative
credit standing.  Investments in debt
securities with original maturities of greater than six months consist
primarily of AAA rated financial instruments and counterparties.  The Company’s investments are primarily in
direct obligations of the United States government or its agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are
generally not significant due to the diversity of the Company’s customers and
geographic sales areas.  The Company
sells its products primarily to OEMs and distributors in the Americas, Europe
and Asia.  The company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and requires
collateral, primarily letters of credit, as deemed necessary.  No single end customer accounted for 10% or
more of the Company’s net sales or accounts receivable balances during the
years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  The Company had two distributors that accounted for more than 10%
of its net sales in the year ended March 31, 2004.  See Note 19, Geographic Information, for
additional information on the Company’s largest distributors.

Use
of Estimates

The Company has made a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” which addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (“VIEs”)
either:  (1) that do not have sufficient
equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) in which the equity
investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial
interest.  In December 2003, the
FASB completed deliberations of proposed modifications to FIN 46 (“Revised
Interpretations”) resulting in multiple effective dates based on the

F-9

nature as well as the creation date
of the VIE.  VIEs created after
January 31, 2003, but prior to January 1, 2004, may be accounted for
either based on the original interpretation or the Revised Interpretations.  For VIEs created or acquired prior to
February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first
interim or annual period ending after December 15, 2003.  Certain disclosures are effective
immediately.  VIEs created after
January 1, 2004 must be accounted for under the Revised Interpretations.  The Company currently has no contractual
relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and
therefore the adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have any effect on the
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” which is generally effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003.  SFAS No. 149
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment
meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in SFAS No. 133,
clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component, amends the
definition of an “underlying” to conform it to the language used in FASB
Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” and amends
certain other existing pronouncements. 
The Company does not have any derivative financial instruments.  The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have any
impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity and cash flows.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity.”  This Statement requires that
certain instruments that were previously classified as equity on a company’s
statement of financial position now be classified as liabilities. The Statement
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31,
2003, and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first
interim financial reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003.  The Company has no instruments impacted by
the adoption of this statement and therefore the adoption of SFAS No. 150 did
not have any effect on the consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
current period presentation.

ACQUISITION
OF GRESHAM, OREGON WAFER FABRICIATION FACILITY

On August 23, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of a
semiconductor manufacturing complex in Gresham, Oregon.  The Company acquired the facility for $183.5
million in cash plus direct acquisition costs of approximately $1.2 million.  The facility is situated on an approximately
140-acre campus east of Portland and comprises approximately 826,500 square
feet.  The facility came equipped with
approximately 350 process tools and 170 support tools.  The Company is currently producing 8-inch
wafers on its 0.5 micron process technology at the Gresham facility.  The facility also houses offices, meeting
rooms and support functions.  The
Company began production activities on October 31, 2003 at this
facility.  As of March 31, 2004,
all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well
as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service.  All manufacturing equipment that was not
being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process.  The lives to be used for depreciating this
equipment at this facility will be evaluated at such time as the assets are
placed in service.

ACQUISITION
OF POWERSMART, INC.

On June 5, 2002, the
Company completed the acquisition of PowerSmart, Inc. in which the Company
acquired all of PowerSmart’s outstanding capital stock and assumed certain
stock options for consideration of $54.0 million in cash plus other
acquisition-related costs of $1.2 million. 
The purchase price was allocated among PowerSmart’s tangible and
intangible assets, in-process research and development and goodwill.  Management determined the value assigned to
the assets acquired through various methods including assistance from a
third-party appraisal.

PowerSmart delivers a battery management whole product solution that
improves system runtimes with a lower system cost for the user.  Included in the whole product solution is an
application tools suite designed to speed up

F-10

implementation during the user’s development and production.  The acquisition was intended to strengthen
the Company’s position in battery management applications such as laptop
computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras
and camcorders.

The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

, and accordingly,
the results of PowerSmart’s operations are included in the Company’s
consolidated results from the date of the acquisition.  The acquisition was not considered
significant under the rules and regulations of the SEC (Rule 3-05 of Regulation
S-X).  Proforma financial information is
not presented since the historical operating results of PowerSmart were not
significant when compared to those of the Company.

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition (amounts in
thousands):

The amount paid in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets
has been allocated to separately identifiable intangible assets based upon an
independent valuation analysis.  An
allocation of $9.3 million of the purchase price was assigned to in-process
research and development and was written off at the date of the acquisition in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement No.
2,

Business
Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method

.”

An allocation of approximately $32.3 million of the purchase price was
made to goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

.  PowerSmart was in its early stages of
operation and did not have the Company’s capabilities in manufacturing,
marketing, sales and distribution, thereby resulting in the Company paying a
premium over fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired.  The Company expects to be able to utilize
the acquired technologies in its other products separate from those acquired
from PowerSmart.  Goodwill related to
the PowerSmart acquisition will not be amortized but will be subject to
periodic impairment tests.  None of the
goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

An allocation of $5.6 million of the purchase price was made to core
technology and other identifiable intangible assets and will be amortized over
their estimated useful lives of seven years.

The Company records acquisition-related purchase consideration as
unearned stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation.”  During the year ended March 31, 2003,
the Company recorded unearned stock-based compensation of $130,000.  The unearned stock-based compensation
includes the intrinsic value of stock options assumed in connection with the
acquisition of PowerSmart that is earned as the employees provide future
services.  The compensation is being
recognized over the period earned, and the expense is included in the
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs.  Amortization of unearned stock compensation
was $46,000 in fiscal 2004 and $59,000 in fiscal 2003.

SPECIAL
CHARGES

The components of special charges are (in thousands):

Fiscal 2004

Closure of Fab 1

On April 7, 2003,
the Company announced its intention to close its Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1)
wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain Fab 1 personnel and processes
into its Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) wafer fabrication facility.  The Company completed this integration
process during the three-month period ended June 30, 2003.  The closure of Fab 1 and the integration of
certain Fab 1 personnel into Fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force
of 207 employees who were either directly involved in the Company’s
manufacturing operations or provided support functions to Fab 1.  The detail of the charges incurred related
to the closure of Fab 1 that were included in cost of sales for the
three-month period ended June 30, 2003 is as follows (amounts in
thousands):

Accelerated depreciation for Fab 1

$

30,608

Fab 1 related charges including severance,
  material and other costs

1,147

Total charges in cost of sales

$

31,755

The facility where Fab 1 was located is an integral part of
the Company’s overall campus in Chandler, Arizona.  Within this same facility resides the Company’s wafer probe, mask
making and other manufacturing related activities.  Consequently it is not possible to abandon or otherwise dispose
of this facility.  The accelerated
depreciation that was taken only related to assets used in the wafer fabrication
operations at the facility.  The Company
has no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer
fabrication operations, and intends to leave it in an idle state.  The property, plant and equipment that was
subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and
accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property, plant and equipment
section of the Company’s balance sheet and related footnote disclosures.

The Company incurred $865,000 of special charges recorded
principally for contract cancellation, severance and other costs related to the
closure of Fab 1 and other actions.

Fiscal 2003

Fab 3 Impairment Charge

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 (“SFAS 144”),

Accounting for the

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

, which is applicable to financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. 
SFAS 144 provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that must be met to classify
an asset as held-for-sale. 
Classification as held-for-sale is an important distinction since such
assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of book value or fair
value less cost to sell.  SFAS 144 was
effective for the Company as of April 1, 2002.  In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company recorded a $41.5 million
asset impairment charge during the quarter ended September 30, 2002, as
described below.

The Company acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in
Puyallup, Washington, referred to as Fab 3, in July 2000.  The original purchase consisted of
semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real property.  It was the

F-12

Company’s intention to bring Fab 3 to productive readiness and commence
volume production of 8-inch wafers using its 0.7 and 0.5 micron process
technologies by August 2001.  The
Company delayed its intended production start up at Fab 3 due to deteriorating
business conditions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal 2002.  Fab 3 has never been brought to productive
readiness.

As is described in Note 2, in August 2002 the Company acquired a
semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon, referred to as Fab
4.  After the acquisition of Fab 4 was
completed, the Company undertook an analysis of the potential production
capacity at Fab 4.  The results of the
production capacity analysis led the Company to determine that Fab 3’s capacity
would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the second quarter of
fiscal 2003 the Company committed to a plan to sell Fab 3.  The Company has retained a third-party
broker to market Fab 3 on its behalf and is actively seeking potential
buyers.  Accordingly, Fab 3 was
classified as an asset held-for-sale as of September 30, 2002 and
maintained that classification at March 31, 2004 given its continued
intent to sell the facility within the next twelve months.

Management determined the value assigned to the assets through various
methods including assistance from a third-party appraisal.  The independent third party used the market
approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair
value of Fab 3.  The comparable sales
included eight properties, including the Company’s purchases of Fab 3 in
July 2000 and Fab 4 in August 2002. 
Based on the results of this appraisal, the Company recorded an asset
impairment charge on Fab 3 of $36.9 million, including estimated costs to
sell.  The remaining value of $60.2
million was classified as an asset held-for-sale and is included as a component
of other current assets at March 31, 2004.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company also
recorded an asset impairment charge of $4.6 million to write-down certain
excess manufacturing equipment located at Fab 3 to its net realizable value of
$0.2 million.  This manufacturing
equipment became “excess” as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the
purchase of Fab 4.  The net realizable
value for the excess manufacturing equipment was determined based on management
estimates.  Substantially all of the
other manufacturing equipment located at Fab 3 has been transferred to and will
be used in the Company’s other wafer fabrication facilities located in Tempe,
Arizona (Fab 2) and Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).

If actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated in
the appraisal, or if future market conditions deteriorate, the net proceeds
from the assets held-for-sale could be less than the amount estimated in the
financial statements and additional charges could result prior to or at the
time of the sale of Fab 3.  However, on
March 31, 2004 management does not believe that Fab 3 is recorded in
excess of its recoverable value based on an assessment of existing market
conditions.

PowerSmart In-Process Research and Development Charge

As described in Note 3,
on June 5, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of PowerSmart, Inc.
in which Microchip acquired all of PowerSmart’s outstanding capital stock and
assumed certain stock options for consideration of $54.0 million in cash plus
other acquisition related costs of $1.2 million.  The purchase price was allocated among PowerSmart’s tangible and
intangible assets, in-process research and development and goodwill based on
management’s consideration of numerous factors including a valuation of these
items with the assistance of an independent valuation firm other than the
Company’s independent auditors.

An allocation of $9.3 million of the purchase price was assigned to
in-process research and development and was written off at the date of the
acquisition in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability of
FASB Statement No. 2,

Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method

.”

SHORT-TERM
INVESTMENTS

The Company’s short-term investments are intended to
establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal, meets liquidity
needs, avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in
relationship to the Company’s investment guidelines and market conditions.
Short-term investments consist of corporate and various government agency debt
securities.  Management classifies the
Company’s short-term investments as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’
equity.  Realized gains and losses and
declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, are included in

F-13

operations.  A
decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that
is deemed to be other than temporary, results in an impairment in the fair
value of the investment.  The impairment
is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established.  Premiums and discounts are amortized or
accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security.  Dividend and interest income are recognized
when earned.  The cost of security sold
is calculated using the specific identification method.  The following is a summary of
available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands):

The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at
March 31, 2003 (amounts in thousands):

During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Company had a gross
realized gain of $8,000 on sales of available-for-sale securities.  During the year ended March 31, 2003,
the Company did not have any gross realized gains or losses on sales of
available-for-sale securities.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the available-for-sale
securities at March 31, 2004, by maturity, are shown below (amounts in
thousands).  Expected maturities can
differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may
have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties, and the
Company views its available-for-sale securities as available for current
operations.

INCOME
TAXES

The provision for income taxes is as follows
(amounts in thousands):

The tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee
stock options reduced taxes currently payable by $37.6 million, $18.0 million
and $18.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  These amounts were
credited to additional paid-in capital in each of the three fiscal years.

The provision for
income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal
tax rate to income before income taxes. 
The sources and tax effects of the differences in the total income tax
provision for income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Pretax income from foreign operations was
$136.3 million, $108.2 million and $92.2 million for the years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Unremitted foreign earnings that are considered to be permanently
invested outside the United States, and on which no deferred taxes have been
provided, amounted to approximately $604.6 million at March 31, 2004.  Should the Company elect in the future to
repatriate a portion of the foreign

F-17

earnings so invested, the Company would
incur income tax expense on such repatriation, net of any available foreign tax
credits.  This would result in
additional income tax expense beyond the computed expected provision in such
periods.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities
are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Management believes that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income such that it is “more likely than not”
that deferred tax assets will be realized.

On June 5, 2002, the Company acquired
all of the outstanding stock of PowerSmart Inc. in a taxable stock
acquisition.  As a result of the
PowerSmart acquisition, $6.7 million of net deferred tax assets were acquired
consisting of a deferred tax asset of $8.8 million relating primarily to net
operating loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability of $2.1 million
relating to intangible assets acquired.

At March 31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $32.5 million,
which begin to expire in varying amounts in the years 2018 through 2024.  The net operating loss carryforward includes
approximately $20.8 million attributable to the acquisition of PowerSmart.  An analysis of the annual limitation on the
utilization of the PowerSmart net operating losses was performed in accordance
with Internal Revenue Code Section 382. 
It was determined that Section 382 will not limit the use of the
PowerSmart net operating losses in full over the carryover period.

At March 31, 2004, the Company had recorded credit
carryforwards of approximately $7.4 million for foreign tax credits, $19.0
million for research and development credits, and $3.6 million for alternative
minimum tax credits.  The foreign tax
credits begin to expire in varying amounts in the years ending March 31,
2006 through March 31, 2007, the research and development credits begin to
expire in varying amounts in the years ending March 31, 2011 through
March 31, 2024 and the alternative minimum tax credits have no expiration
date.

The Company’s Thailand manufacturing
operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays granted to the Company
based on its investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand.  Although the Company’s tax holidays in
Thailand partially expired in October 2003, the Company’s manufacturing
operations in Thailand are being conducted using equipment that was invested
pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until

F-18

September 2006.  The aggregate dollar benefits derived from
these tax holidays approximated $45.3 million, $31.4 million and $30.7
million for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  The benefit the tax
holiday had on net income per share approximated $0.21, $0.15 and $0.15 for the
years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company believes that it maintains
adequate tax reserves to offset the potential liabilities that may arise upon
audit.  If such amounts ultimately prove
to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax
benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
necessary.  If such amounts ultimately
prove to be less than the ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would
result.  The Company has included in
income taxes payable reserves for potential losses.  Should such losses occur, they would result in the reduction of
deferred tax assets or payments of amounts accrued.

CONTINGENCIES

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in a
limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could
incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.  Although the outcome of these actions is not presently
determinable, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not harm its business. 
Litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon, and
the Company is, and from time to time has been, subject to such litigation.

In the Company’s opinion, based
on consultation with legal counsel, as of March 31, 2004, the effect of
such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position.

Microchip Technology Incorporated v. U.S. Philips Corporation, et al

.
(

District
of Arizona, 01-CV-2090-PGR)

. 
As previously reported, on October 26, 2001, the Company filed an
action in federal district court in Arizona for declaratory relief against U.S.
Philips Corporation and Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together
“Philips”) requesting that the Court declare, among other matters, that we do
not infringe Philips’ U.S. Patent Nos. 4,689,740 and 5,559,502.  The Company initiated legal action so that a
determination could be made relating to the validity, enforceability and
alleged infringement of, and the Company’s license to, the Philips’
patents.  In response to the Company’s
filing the declaratory judgment action in Arizona, Philips filed an action
against us in federal district court in New York, alleging infringement of the
‘740 patent and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief.  The Arizona court has agreed to retain
jurisdiction, and the New York case has been transferred to Arizona.  In response to this development, on
December 16, 2002, Philips filed a demand for arbitration in Amsterdam
with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  The Company submitted to the ICC Court of Arbitration a jurisdictional
objection to proceeding with arbitration pending the outcome of the Arizona
litigation.  On May 16, 2003, the ICC
declined to address whether arbitration is inappropriate for jurisdictional
reasons and instead left the issue as one, which can be brought before the ICC
arbitration panel.  On June 13,
2003, the Arizona court granted the Company’s motion to stay the ICC
arbitration and proceed with the action in Arizona.  Philips has filed a motion to appeal the Arizona court order
staying the ICC arbitration.  On
March 2, 2004, the motion to appeal was argued by Philips’ and Microchip’s
counsel in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  At this time the ICC arbitration, the appeal
of the Arizona court order staying arbitration, and the Arizona declaratory
judgment action are all pending.  The
Company intends to continue to litigate this matter vigorously.  The Company currently believes that the
outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position or results of operations.  However, the final outcome of this matter is
inherently uncertain, and should the outcome be adverse to the Company, it may
be required to pay damages and other expenses and may be subjected to
injunctive relief.  The litigation, even
if resolved in the Company’s favor, may also result in diversion of management
attention and significant legal fees.

14.

LONG-TERM
DEBT

The Company has an unsecured line of credit with a financial
institution in Asia for up to $5.0 million (U.S. Dollar equivalent).  This credit line is denominated in U.S.
Dollars, bearing interest at the Singapore Interbank Offering Rate (SIBOR) of
1.354% at March 31, 2004 plus 0.75% and expiring in July 2004.  There were no borrowings against this line of
credit as of March 31, 2004, but an allocation of $0.6 million of the
available line was made, relating to import guarantees associated with the
Company’s business in Thailand.  There
are no covenants associated with the foreign line of credit.

STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

Stockholder Rights Plan.

Effective
October 11, 1999, the Company adopted an Amended and Restated Preferred
Shares Rights Agreement (the “Amended Rights Agreement”).  The Amended Rights Agreement amends and
restates the Preferred Share Rights Agreement adopted by the Company as of
February 13, 1995 (the “Prior Rights Agreement”).  Under the Prior Rights Agreement, on
February 13, 1995, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of
one right (a “Right”) to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of the Company’s
Series A Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) for each
outstanding share of common stock, $.001 par value, of the Company.  The dividend was payable on February 24,
1995 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date.  The Amended Rights Agreement supersedes the
Prior Rights Agreement as originally executed. 
Under the Amended Rights Agreement, each Right enables the holder to
purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred at
a purchase price of seventy four dollars and seven cents ($74.07) (the
“Purchase Price”), subject to adjustment. 
Under the Amended Rights Agreement, the rights will become exercisable upon
the earlier of (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or a
group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right
to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding
common shares, or (ii) 10 days (or such later date as may be determined by
action of the Company’s Board of Directors) following the commencement of, or
announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the
consummation of which would result in a beneficial ownership by a person or
group of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common shares.

Stock Repurchase Activity.

On
August 7, 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
repurchase up to 2,500,000 shares of its common stock in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions.  As
of March 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased the entire 2,500,000 common
share authorization for $59.3 million. 
On March 11, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of its common stock in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As of March 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased 1,200,100
common shares under this authorization for $31.7 million.  As of March 31, 2004, all but 1,967,508
of the purchased shares under both authorizations had been reissued to fund
stock option exercises and purchases under the Company’s employee stock
purchase plan.  During the twelve months
ended March 31, 2003, the Company purchased 1,264,700 shares of its common
stock for $27.1 million.  During the
twelve months ended March 31, 2004, the Company purchased 2,435,400 shares
of its common stock for $63.9 million, of which $10.6 million was not paid
until April 2004 and is reflected in the March 31, 2004 accounts
payable balance.

The Company maintained a net shares settled forward contract for the
year ended March 31, 2002.  Under
the original terms of this contract, the Company could deliver or receive
shares of common stock or cash based on the fair market value of its common
stock on periodic settlement dates.  The
contract was subsequently amended in fiscal 2001 to only allow the Company to
receive cash but to deliver shares or cash based on the fair market value of
its common stock on periodic settlement dates.

During the year ended March 31, 2002, the Company made a delivery
of 572,645 shares in connection with the net shares settled forward
contract.  No shares were received in
respect of the net shares settled forward contract for the year ended
March 31, 2002.  During the year
ended March 31, 2002, the Company received $14.1 million in connection
with an early termination covering 1,650,000 of the shares outstanding in the
net shares settled forward contract. 
All amounts received or delivered under the net shares settled forward
contract have been recorded to additional paid-in-capital.  The Company closed out the net shares
settled forward contract in its entirety on January 15, 2002 and made a
cash payment of $27.8 million to purchase the remaining 1,610,606 shares of its
common stock outstanding under the contract. 
These shares were recorded as treasury shares.

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

The Company maintains a contributory profit-sharing plan for its
domestic employees meeting certain eligibility and service requirements.  The plan qualifies under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and allowed employees to
contribute up to 20% of their base salary up through March 31, 2002,
subject to maximum annual limitations prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service.  The plan was amended as of
April 1, 2002 to allow employees to contribute up to 60% of their base
salary, subject to maximum annual limitations prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Company shall make
a matching contribution of up to 25% of the first 4% of the

F-20

participant’s eligible compensation and may award up to an additional
25% under the discretionary match.  All
matches are provided on a quarterly basis and require the participant to be an
active employee at the end of each quarter. 
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company contributions to the plan totaled $1 million, $1 million and $0.7
million, respectively.

The Company’s 2001 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “2001 Purchase Plan”) became effective on March 1, 2002.  The Board of Directors approved the 2001
Purchase Plan in May 2001 and the stockholders approved it in
August 2001.  Under the 2001 Purchase
Plan, eligible employees of the Company may purchase shares of common stock at
semi-annual intervals through periodic payroll deductions.  The purchase price in general will be 85% of
the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of any
semi-annual offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the semi-annual
purchase date.  Depending upon a
participant’s entry date into the 2001 Purchase Plan, purchase periods under
the 2001 Purchase Plan consist of overlapping periods of either 24, 18, 12 or 6
months in duration.  2,450,000 shares of
common stock have been previously reserved for issuance under the 2001 Purchase
Plan.  In May 2003, the Board of
Directors reserved an additional 975,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the 2001 Purchase Plan, which was approved by the stockholders in
August 2003.  In May 2003 and
August 2003, the Company’s Board and stockholders approved an annual
automatic increase in the number of shares reserved under the 2001 Purchase
Plan.  The automatic increase takes
effect on January 1, 2005, and on each January 1 thereafter during
the term of the plan, and is equal to the lesser of (i) 1,500,000 shares, (ii)
one half of one percent (0.5%) of the then outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock, or (iii) such lesser amount as is approved by the Company’s Board
of Directors.

Prior to March 1, 2002, the Company
maintained an employee stock purchase plan that allowed eligible employees of
the Company to purchase shares of common stock at semi-annual intervals through
periodic payroll deductions.  The
purchase price per share, in general, was 85% of the lower of the fair market
value of the common stock on the participant’s entry date into the offering
period or 85% of the fair market value on the semi-annual purchase date.  On May 1, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved the termination of this employee stock purchase plan immediately
following the close of the February 2002 purchase period.  During the term of this employee stock
purchase plan, 12,957,750 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance,
and through the February 2002 purchase period, 12,717,729 shares had been
issued under this employee stock purchase plan.

During fiscal 1995, a purchase plan was
adopted for employees in non-U.S. locations. 
Such plan allows for the purchase price per share to be 100% of the
lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the beginning or end of
the semi-annual purchase plan period. 
Since the inception of this purchase plan, 248,593 shares of common
stock have been reserved for issuance and 219,064 shares have been issued under
this purchase plan.

Effective January 1, 1997, the Company adopted a
non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement.  This plan is unfunded and is maintained primarily for the purpose
of providing deferred compensation for a select group of highly compensated
employees as defined in ERISA Sections 201, 301 and 401.  There are no Company matching contributions
made under this plan.

Employees in certain foreign locations are
covered by statutory pension plans, none of which are defined benefit
plans.  Contributions are accrued based
on an actuarially determined percentage of compensation and are funded in
amounts sufficient to meet statutory requirements.  Pension expense amounted to $0.1 million, $0.3 million and
$0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The Company has a management incentive
compensation plan which provides for bonus payments, based on a percentage of
base salary, from an incentive pool created from operating profits of the
Company, at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  During the year ended March 31, 2004, $1.8 million was
charged against operations for this plan. 
The Company did not make any payments under its management incentive
compensation plan during fiscal 2002 or fiscal 2003.

The Company also has a plan that, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, provides a cash bonus to all employees of the Company based
on the operating profits of the Company. 
During the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, $2.4 million,
$1.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, were charged against operations
for this plan.

STOCK OPTION PLANS

Under the Company’s stock option plans (the “Plans”),
officers, key employees, non-employee directors and consultants may be granted
non-statutory stock options to purchase shares of common stock at a price not
less than 100% of the fair value of the option shares on the grant date.  Options granted under the Plans vest over
the period determined by the Board of Directors at the date of grant, at
periods ranging from one year to four years. 
The maximum term of options granted under the Plans is 10 years.  The Company did not make any stock option
grants to consultants during the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002.  At March 31, 2004, there
were 17,060,762 shares available for grant under the Plans.  The per share weighted average fair value of
stock options granted under the Plans for the years ended March 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 was $12.06, $15.00 and $10.28, respectively, based on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions:

Under the Plans, 89,943,237 shares of common stock had been
reserved for issuance since the inception of the Plans.

The stock option activity is as follows:

F-22

The following table summarizes information about the stock options
outstanding at March 31, 2004:

At March 31, 2004 and 2003, the number of option shares
exercisable was 11,583,432 and 12,093,823, respectively, and the
weighted-average exercise price of those options was $13.261 and  $10.48, respectively.

The Company received a tax benefit of (in thousands) $37.6
million, $18.0 million and $18.8 million for the years ended March 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, from the exercise of non-qualified stock
options and the disposition of stock acquired with incentive stock options or
through the Company’s employee stock purchase plan.  For financial reporting purposes, the tax effect of this
deduction is accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather
than as a reduction of income tax expense.

18.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company leases office space, transportation and other
equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through
March 31, 2009.  The future minimum
lease commitments under these leases are payable as follows (amounts in thousands):

Rental expense under operating leases totaled $5.4 million,
$5.7 million and $4.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION

The Company operates in one operating segment and engages
primarily in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of
semiconductor products.  The Company
sells its products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
in a broad range of market segments, performs on-going credit evaluations of
its customers and generally requires no collateral.  The Company’s operations outside the United States consist of
product assembly and final test facilities in Thailand, sales and support
centers and design centers in certain foreign countries.  Domestic operations are responsible for the
design, development and wafer fabrication of all products, as well as the
coordination of production planning and shipping to meet worldwide customer
commitments.  The

F-23

Thailand test facility is reimbursed in relation to value
added with respect to assembly and test operations and other functions
performed, and certain foreign sales offices receive a commission on export
sales within their territory. 
Accordingly, for financial statement purposes, it is not meaningful to
segregate sales or operating profits for the test and foreign sales office
operations.  Identifiable assets by
geographic area are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Sales to unaffiliated customers located outside the United
States, primarily in Asia and Europe, aggregated approximately 71%, 71% and 69%
of consolidated net sales for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.  Sales to customers
in Europe represented 28%, 27% and 31% of consolidated net sales for the years
ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Sales to customers in Asia represented 41%,
39% and 35% of consolidated net sales for the years ended March 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.  Sales into
China, including Hong Kong, represented 14% and 13% of consolidated net sales
for the years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Sales into China did not exceed 10% of the
Company’s net sales in fiscal 2002. 
Sales into any other individual foreign country did not exceed 10% of
the Company’s net sales for any of the years presented.

The Company had two distributors who represented more than
10% of its net sales during fiscal 2004. 
The Company’s largest distributor accounted for approximately 13% of its
net sales and its second largest distributor accounted for approximately 12% of
its net sales in fiscal 2004.  In fiscal
2003 and 2002, the Company had one distributor that accounted for approximately
12% and 13%, respectively, of its net sales.

20.

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amount of cash equivalents
approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months.  The carrying amount of short-term
investments approximates fair value because the longer-term instruments have
interest rate reset features that regularly adjust to current market
rates.  The carrying amount of accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value
due to the short-term maturity of the amounts. 
The fair value of capital lease obligations, long-term debt and lines of
credit approximate their carrying value as they are estimated by discounting
the future cash flows at rates currently offered to the Company for similar
debt instruments.

The Company has entered into certain financial instruments
in the normal course of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates.  These financial
instruments include standby letters of credit and foreign currency forward
contracts.  When engaging in forward
contracts, risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet
the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest
rates and foreign exchange rates.  At
March 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company held contracts with notional amounts
totaling $3.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively, which were entered into
and hedged the Company’s foreign currency risk.  The value of the contracts is based on quoted market prices.  The contracts matured in June 2004 and
May 2003, respectively.  Unrealized
gains and losses as of the balance sheet dates and realized gains and losses
for the years ending March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were not material.

NET INCOME PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted net income per share (in thousands except per share amounts):

F-24

Weighted average shares exclude the effect of antidilutive
options.  As of March 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, the number of options that were antidilutive were 4,532,872,
4,282,029 and 2,943,083, respectively.

The Company had a net shares settled forward contract
outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2002.  No shares were received in conjunction with
the net shares settled forward contract during the year ended March 31,
2002.  During the year ended March 31,
2002, the Company delivered 572,645 shares in conjunction with the net shares
settled forward contract.  During the
years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company purchased 2,435,400

and 1,264,700 shares of common stock, respectively,
in open market activities at a total price of $63.9 million and $27.1
million, respectively.  During the years
ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, there were no purchases of common stock in
open market activities.

Both basic and diluted net income per share incorporate the
affects of the Company’s stock repurchase program, shares received and
delivered in connection with the net shares settled forward contract and stock
purchased in open market transactions as outlined above.
