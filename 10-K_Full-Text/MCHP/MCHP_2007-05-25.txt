Embedded
      control systems
      typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active, and sometimes
      sole, component.  A microcontroller is a self-contained
      computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, non-volatile program
      memory, random access memory for data storage and various input/output
      peripheral capabilities.  In addition to the microcontroller, a
      complete embedded control system incorporates application-specific software
      and
      may include specialized peripheral device controllers, non-volatile memory
      components such as EEPROMs, and various analog and interface
      products.

The
      increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers
      one of the larger segments of the semiconductor
      market.  Microcontrollers are currently available in 4-bit through
      32-bit architectures.  4-bit microcontrollers are relatively
      inexpensive, but they generally lack the minimum functionality required in
      most
      applications and are typically used in relatively simple
      applications.  8-bit microcontrollers remain very cost-effective for a
      wide range of high volume embedded control applications and, as a result,
      continue to represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller
      market.  16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers provide higher performance
      and functionality, and are generally found in more complex embedded control
      applications.

Many
      of
      the microcontrollers shipped today are ROM-based and must be programmed by
      the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing, resulting in long lead times,
      based on market conditions, for delivery of such microcontrollers.  In
      addition to delayed product introduction, these long lead times can result
      in
      potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes
      in
      the firmware are required. To address these issues, some suppliers offer
      programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the
      customer’s manufacturing line, thus significantly reducing lead time and
      inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur.  While
      these microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to ROM-based
      microcontrollers, manufacturing technology has evolved over time to the point
      where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium
      over ROM-based microcontrollers, thus providing significant value to
      microcontroller customers.  As a result, reprogrammable
      microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller
      market.

Our
      Products

Our
      strategic focus is on embedded control solutions, including:

·

microcontrollers

·

development
                tools

·

analog
                and interface products

·

memory
                products

We
      provide highly cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the
      advantages of small size, high performance, low voltage/power operation and
      ease
      of development, enabling timely and cost-effective embedded control product
      integration by our customers.

Microcontrollers

We
      offer
      a broad family of microcontroller products featuring our unique, proprietary
      architecture marketed under the PIC

®

brand
      name.  We believe that our PIC product family is a price/performance
      leader in the worldwide microcontroller market.  We have shipped over
      5 billion PIC microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction
      in 1990.  Our PIC products are designed for applications requiring
      field-programmability, high performance, low power and cost
      effectiveness.  They feature a variety of memory technology
      configurations, low voltage and power, small footprint and ease of
      use.  Our performance results from a product architecture which
      features dual data and instruction pathways, referred to as a Harvard dual-bus
      architecture; a Reduced Instruction Set Computer, referred to as RISC; and
      variable length instructions; all of which provide significant speed advantages
      over alternative single-bus, Complex Instruction Set Computer architectures,
      referred to as CISC.  With over 400 microcontrollers in our product
      portfolio, we target the 8-bit and 16-bit

microcontroller
      markets.  Additionally, our scalable product architecture allows us to
      successfully target both the entry-level of the 32-bit microcontroller market,
      as well as the 4-bit microcontroller marketplace, significantly enlarging our
      addressable market.

Digital
      Signal Controllers (DSC) are a subset of our 16-bit microcontroller
      offering.  Our dsPIC

®

Digital
      Signal Controller families integrate the control features of high-performance
      16-bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of Digital Signal
      Processors (DSPs), along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making
      them
      suitable for a large number of embedded control applications.  Our
      dsPIC product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development
      tools, software application libraries, development boards and reference designs
      to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle.  With
      its field-re-programmability, large selection of peripheral functions, small
      footprint and ease of use, we believe that our dsPIC Digital Signal Controllers
      enlarge our addressable market.


We
      have
      used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring
      additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and
      production of our PIC family of microcontroller products.  Our
      extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced, low cost
      user
      programmability feature by incorporating non-volatile memory, such as Flash,
      EEPROM and EPROM Memory, into the microcontroller, and to be a leader in
      reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings.

Development
      Tools

We
      offer
      a comprehensive set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development
      tools.  These tools enable system designers to quickly and easily
      program a PIC microcontroller and dsPIC Digital Signal Controllers for specific
      applications and, we believe are a key factor for obtaining design
      wins.

Our
      family of development tools operates in the standard Windows

®

environment
      on
      standard PC hardware.  These tools range from entry-level systems,
      which include an assembler and programmer or in-circuit debugging hardware,
      to
      fully configured systems that provide in-circuit emulation
      hardware.  Customers moving from entry-level designs to those
      requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning
      and tools as they migrate to future PIC devices since all of our systems share
      the same integrated development environment.

Many
      independent companies also develop and market application development tools
      that
      support our standard microcontroller product architecture.  Currently,
      there are more than 150 third-party tool suppliers worldwide whose products
      support our proprietary microcontroller architecture.

We
      believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and third-party
      development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an
      important factor in the future selection of our embedded control
      products.  These development tools allow design engineers to develop
      thousands of application-specific products from our standard
      microcontrollers.  To date, we have shipped more than 500,000
      development tools.

Analog
      and Interface Products

Our
      analog and interface products now consist of several families with over 500
      power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management and interface
      products.  At the end of fiscal 2007, our mixed-signal analog and
      interface products were being shipped to more than 12,100 end
      customers.

We
      continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our
      existing microcontroller customer base, which we refer to as our analog “attach”
strategy, as well as to new customers.  In addition to our “attach”
strategy, we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional
      PIC
      microcontroller and memory products customer base.  We market these,
      and all of our products, based on an application segment approach targeted
      to
      provide customers with application solutions.

Memory
      Products

Our
      memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable
      read only memory, referred to as Serial EEPROMs.  We sell these
      devices primarily into the embedded control market, and we are one of the
      largest suppliers of such devices worldwide.  Serial EEPROM products
      are used for non-volatile program and data storage in systems where such data
      must be either modified frequently or retained for long
      periods.  Serial EEPROMs have a very low I/O pin requirement,
      permitting production of very small devices.

Manufacturing

Our
      manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and
      test.  The ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important
      component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of
      manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers
      in
      the embedded control industry.  By owning our wafer fabrication
      facilities and much of our assembly and test operations, and by employing
      statistical techniques (statistical process control,


designed
        experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and
        maintain high production yields.  Direct control over manufacturing
        resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.  This
        control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of
        the
        assembly and testing profit margin.

Our
      manufacturing facilities are located in:

·

Tempe,
                Arizona (Fab 2)

·

Chandler,
                Arizona (probe operations)

·

                Washington (Fab 3)
                (non-operational)

·

                Oregon (Fab 4)

·

Bangkok,
                Thailand (assembly, probe and test)

Wafer
      Fabrication

Fab
      currently produces 8-inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from
      0.35
      to 5.0 microns.  During fiscal 2007, Fab 2 operated at approximately
      99% of its capacity compared to approximately 98% during fiscal
      2006.  Operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive
      impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent
      in wafer fabrication manufacturing.

Fab
      3 is
      currently non-operational and being held-for-future-use.  See “Item 6
– Selected Financial Data – Fiscal 2003 – Fab 3 Impairment Charge,” below at
      page 20, for a discussion of the status of Fab 3.

We
      acquired Fab 4 in August 2002 and began production on October 31,
      2003.  Fab 4 currently produces 8-inch wafers using predominantly 0.5
      micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below
      0.18 microns.  A significant amount of clean room capacity and
      equipment acquired with Fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support
      incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs.  We believe the combined
      capacity of Fab 2, Fab 4 and Fab 3 will provide sufficient capacity to
      allow us to respond to increases in future demand.

We
      continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce
      future manufacturing costs.  We believe that our ability to
      successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important
      for
      us to remain competitive.

We
      outsource a small percentage of our wafer production requirements to third-party
      wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities.

Assembly
      and Test

We
      perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near Bangkok,
      Thailand.  At March 31, 2007, approximately 72% of our assembly
      requirements were being performed in our Thailand facility.  As of
      March 31, 2007, our Thailand facility was testing substantially all of our
      wafer
      production.  We use third-party assembly and test contractors in
      several Asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test
      requirements.

General
      Matters Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations

We
      employ
      proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller
      and memory products.  We believe our processes afford us both
      cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater
      functionality in new product designs.  While many of our competitors
      develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product
      lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and
      non-volatile memory products.  This allows us to more fully absorb our
      process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market
      more rapidly.  Our engineers utilize advanced Computer Aided Design
      tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our
      in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify
      design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and
      efficiently.

Due
      to
      the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high
      manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit
      and
      overall operating results.  Our continuous focus on manufacturing
      productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our
      facilities.  Our manufacturing yields are

primarily
      driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control,
      extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing
      facilities and equipment.  Maintenance of manufacturing productivity
      and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating
      results.  The manufacture of integrated circuits, particularly
      non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices, such as those that we
      produce, are complex processes.  These processes are sensitive to a
      wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the
      manufacturing environment, impurities in


the
      materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and
      equipment.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from
      time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing
      yields.  Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to
      maintain yields at approximately the current levels.

At
      the
      end of fiscal 2007, we owned long-lived assets (consisting of property, plant
      and equipment, intangibles and goodwill) in the United States amounting to
      $525.0 million and $121.1 million in other countries, including $114.6
      million in Thailand.  At the end of fiscal 2006, we owned long-lived
      assets in the United States amounting to $576.9 million and
      $124.5 million in other countries, including $118.0 million in
      Thailand.

Research
      and Development (R&D)

We
      are
      committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including
      development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process
      technologies.  We believe these investments are significant factors in
      maintaining our competitive position.  Our current R&D activities
      focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, Serial
      EEPROM memory, analog and interface products, new development systems, software
      and application-specific

software
      libraries.  We are also developing new design and process technologies
      to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost
      reductions and performance improvements in existing products.

In
      fiscal
      2007, our R&D expenses were $113.7

million, compared
      to $94.9

million in fiscal 2006 and $93.0 million in
      fiscal 2005.  R&D expenses in fiscal 2007 included $9.6 million of
      share-based compensation as a result of the adoption of FASB Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123R (revised 2004)

Sales
      and Distribution

General

We
      market
      our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel
      and
      distributors.

Our
      direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three
      geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently
      maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in
      all
      three geographic markets.  We believe that a strong technical service
      presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control
      market.  Many of our field sales engineers (FSEs), field application
      engineers (FAEs), and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds
      and
      have been previously employed in high technology environments.  We
      believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive
      advantage in the sale of our products.  The primary mission of our FAE
      team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic
      training sessions for the balance of our sales team.  FAEs also
      frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around
      the
      world.

Distribution

Our
      distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad
      base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors can provide
      an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer
      base.  We believe that customers recognize Microchip for its products
      and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.

In
      fiscal
      2007, 2006 and 2005, we derived 65% of our net sales from sales through
      distributors and 35% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by
      Microchip.  Our largest distributor accounted for approximately 11% of
      our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and
      2005.  Our second largest distributor accounted for approximately 10%
      of our net sales in fiscal 2007,

11% of our net sales in
      fiscal 2006 and 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2005.  No other
      distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in
      fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Distributors
      generally have broad-based rights to return product to us.  As revenue
      on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our
      product to their end customers, distributor returns have no impact on our
      revenue.

We
      also
      grant certain credits to our distributors.  The credits are granted to
      the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business
      to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products
      to
      their end

customers.  The
      credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until
      they
      provide information regarding the sale to their end customer.  The
      effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us
      to
      our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized
      by
      us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end
      customers.


We
      also
      provide these distributors with price protection by reducing product pricing
      based on market conditions, competitive considerations and other
      factors.  Price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory
      that they have on hand at the date the price protection is
      offered.  When we reduce the selling price of our products, it allows
      the distributors to claim a credit against their outstanding accounts receivable
      balances based on the new price of the inventory they have on hand as of the
      date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue recognition impact
      from the price protection activity.

We
      do not
      offer material incentive programs to our distributors.

We
      do not
      have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors,
      may
      each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced
      notice.  The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or
      more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter
      and could result in an increase in inventory returns.

Sales
      by Geography

Sales
      by
      geography for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows (dollars in
      thousands):

Sales
      to
      foreign customers accounted for approximately 74% of our net sales in fiscal
      2007, 74% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 73% of our net sales in fiscal
      2005.  Our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in Asia
      and Europe, which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas
      for
      automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial control
      products.  Americas sales include sales to customers in the United
      States, Canada, Central America and South America.

Sales
      to
      customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 18% of
      our
      net sales in fiscal 2007 and 17% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and
      2005.  In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, sales to customers in Taiwan
      accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales.  We did not have
      sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during
      fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Our
      international sales are predominately U.S. dollar
      denominated.  Although foreign sales are subject to certain government
      export restrictions, we have not experienced any material difficulties to date
      as a result of export restrictions.

The
      semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations
      of
      supply and demand.  Since a significant portion of our revenue is from
      consumer markets and international sales, our business may be subject to
      seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal
      year.  However, broad strength in our overall business in recent
      periods has had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality,
      and
      has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our
      business.

Backlog

As
      of
      April 30, 2007 our backlog was approximately $185.4 million, compared to $231.2
      million as of April 30, 2006.  Our backlog includes all purchase
      orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months.

We
      primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within
      a
      short time after we receive an order.  Our business and, to a large
      extent, that of the entire semiconductor industry, is characterized by
      short-term orders and shipment schedules.  Orders constituting our
      current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules, or to cancellation
      at the customer’s option without significant penalty.  Thus, while
      backlog is useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date
      may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period.

Competition

The
      semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized
      by
      price erosion and rapid technological change.  We compete with major
      domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater
      market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution
      and
      other resources than we have with which to pursue


engineering,
        manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their
        products.  Furthermore, capacity in the semiconductor industry is
        generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product
        availability could adversely affect our competitive position.

We
      currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and
      performance of our embedded control products, including the following product
      characteristics:

·

speed

·

functionality

·

density

·

power
                  consumption

·

reliability

·

packaging
                  alternatives

We
      believe that other
      important competitive factors in the embedded control market
      include:

·

ease
                  of use

·

functionality
                  of application development systems

·

dependable
                  delivery and quality

·

technical
                  service and support

·

price

·

availability

We
      believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors,
      but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm
      our
      business.

Patents,
      Licenses and Trademarks

We
      maintain a portfolio of United States and foreign patents, expiring on various
      dates between 2007 and 2024.  We also have numerous additional United
      States and foreign patent applications pending.  We do not expect that
      the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our
      business.  While we intend to continue to seek patents on our
      inventions and manufacturing processes, we believe that our continued success
      depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of
      our
      personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments, rather
      than on our patents.  Our existing patents and any new patents that
      are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful
      protection or any commercial advantage to us.  In addition, the laws
      of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights
      to
      the same extent as the laws of the United States.

We
      have
      entered into certain intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with
      other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing
      processes.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we and our
      customers have from time to time received, and may in the future receive,
      communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual
      property rights on certain of our products or technologies.  We
      investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is
      appropriate.  Based on industry practice, we believe that in most
      cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially
      reasonable terms, but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable
      terms, that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement
      would not be assessed.  Litigation, which could result in

substantial
      cost to us and require significant attention from management, may be necessary
      to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, or to defend
      us
      against claimed infringement of the rights of others.  The failure to
      obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of
      infringement claims, could harm our business.

Environmental
      Regulation

We
      must
      comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental
      regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain
      chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes.  Our
      facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe
      that our activities are conducted in compliance with such
      regulations.  Any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement
      could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant
      expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Any failure by us
      to adequately control the storage, use and disposal of regulated substances
      could result in future liabilities.

Increasing
      public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic
      manufacturing operations.  While we have not experienced any
      materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations,
      our
      business and

results
      of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of,
      or
      to adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present
      or
      future environmental regulations.


Employees

As
      of
      March 31, 2007, we had 4,582 employees.  None of our employees are
      represented by a labor organization.  We have never had a work
      stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good.

RISK
                  FACTORS

When
      evaluating Microchip and its business, you should give careful consideration
      to
      the factors listed below, in addition to the information provided elsewhere
      in
      this Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the Securities and
      Exchange Commission.


Our
      quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce
      our
      net sales and profitability

.

Our
      quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that
      could
      reduce our net sales and profitability, many of which are beyond our
      control.  Some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating
      results include:

·

changes
                  in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of
                  our
                  customers

·

levels
                  of inventories at our customers

·

the
                  mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from
                  our
                  inventory

·

changes
                  in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in
                  manufacturing yields

·

our
                  ability to secure sufficient assembly and testing
                  capacity

·

availability
                  of raw materials and equipment

·

competitive
                  developments including pricing
                  pressures

·

the
                  level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a
                  quarter

·

the
                  level of sell-through of our products through
                  distribution

·

changes
                  or fluctuations in customer order patterns and
                  seasonality

·

constrained
                  availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers’
                  ability to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact
                  our
                  sales to those customers

·

costs
                  and outcomes of any tax audits or any litigation involving intellectual
                  property, customers or other issues

·

disruptions
                  in our business or our customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity,
                  armed conflict, war, worldwide oil prices and supply, public health
                  concerns or disruptions in the transportation
                  system

·

property
                  damage or other losses which are not covered by
                  insurance

·

general
                  economic, industry or political conditions in the United States
                  or
                  internationally

We
      believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not
      necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons
      as
      indications of future performance.  In future periods our operating
      results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market
      analysts and investors, which would likely have a negative effect on the price
      of our common stock.

Our
      operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing
      capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields.

The
      manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile,
      erasable CMOS memory and logic devices such as those that we produce, are
      complex processes.  These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of
      factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment,
      impurities in the materials used, the performance of our wafer fabrication
      personnel and equipment, and other quality issues.  As is typical in
      the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than
      anticipated manufacturing yields.  Our operating results will suffer
      if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current
      levels.  This could include delays in the recognition of revenue, loss
      of revenue or future orders, and customer-imposed penalties for failure to
      meet
      contractual shipment deadlines.

Our
      operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than
      optimal capacity.  Lower capacity utilization results in certain costs
      being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins.

We
      are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and
      are therefore limited in our visibility of future product
      shipments.

Our
      net
      sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog
      and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter, which we
      refer
      to as turns orders.  We measure turns orders at the beginning of a
      quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set
      entering the quarter.  Historically, we have proven our ability to
      respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy,
      resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery
      schedules.  Shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a
      percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and
      reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments.  Turns
      orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead
      times.  Because turns orders are difficult to predict, varying levels
      of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast.  If we
      do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter
      relative to our revenue targets, our revenue and operating results may
      suffer.

Intense
      competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures, reduced
      sales
      of our products or reduced market share.

The
      semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized
      by
      price erosion and rapid technological change.  We compete with major
      domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater
      market recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing,
      distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering,
      manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.  We may
      be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our
      business.


Our
      ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within
      and
      outside our control, including, but not limited to:

·

the
                  quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use, pricing
                  and
                  diversity of our products

·

our
                  success in designing and manufacturing new products including those
                  implementing new technologies

·

the
                  rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own
                  applications

·

product
                  introductions by our competitors

·

the
                  number, nature and success of our competitors in a given
                  market

·

our
                  ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other
                  supplies at
                  acceptable prices

·

our
                  ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization
                  of
                  intellectual property rights

·

the
                  quality of our customer service and our ability to address the
                  needs of
                  our customers, and

·

general
                  market and economic conditions.

Historically,
      average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life
      of
      any particular product.  The overall average selling prices of our
      microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained
      relatively constant, while average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM and
      non-proprietary analog and interface products have declined over
      time.

We
      have
      experienced, and expect to continue to experience, modest pricing declines
      in
      certain of our more mature proprietary product lines, due primarily to
      competitive conditions.  We have been able to moderate average selling
      price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to
      introduce new products with more features and higher prices.  We have
      experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future
      varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our Serial EEPROM and
      non-proprietary analog products.

We
      may be
      unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of
      increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely impact our
      operating results.

Our
      business is dependent on selling through
      distributors.

Sales
      through distributors accounted for 65% of our net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006
      and
      2005.  Our two largest distributors together accounted for
      approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2007, approximately 24% of our
      net
      sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 25% of our net sales in fiscal
      2005.  We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and
      both we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little
      or
      no advanced notice.  We believe that customers recognize Microchip for
      its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply
      channel.

During
      fiscal 2006, we reduced the gross margin that certain of our distributors earn
      when they sell our products.  We reduced these distributors’ gross
      margins because we believed these distributors did not have sufficient technical
      sales resources to properly address the marketplace for our
      products.  Since fiscal 2006, we have added a significant number of
      technical sales employees throughout our worldwide sales organization to address
      the support requirements for both our OEM and distribution
      customers.  Although these actions have not had a material adverse
      impact on the overall effectiveness of our distribution channel, there can
      be no
      assurance that there will not be an adverse impact in the future.

The
      loss
      of, or a disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could
      reduce our net sales in a given period and could result in an increase in
      inventory returns.

Our
      success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely
      basis.

Our
      future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce
      new
      products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price
      and performance and which address customer requirements.  The success
      of our new product introductions depends on various factors, including, but
      not
      limited to:

·

proper
                  new product selection

·

timely
                  completion and introduction of new product
                  designs

·

development
                  of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new
                  products
                  easy for engineers to understand and use,
                  and

·

market
                  acceptance of our customers’ end
                  products.


Because
      our products are complex, we have experienced delays from time to time in
      completing development of new products.  In addition, our new products
      may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance.  We may be
      unable to design, develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis,
      which could adversely impact our future operating results.

Our
      success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and
      process technologies.  Semiconductor design and process technologies
      are subject to rapid technological change and require significant R&D
      expenditures.  We and other companies in the industry have, from time
      to time, experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process
      technologies and, consequently, have suffered reduced manufacturing yields
      or
      delays in product deliveries.  Our future operating results could be
      adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is
      substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented.

We
      must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition
      for qualified personnel is intense in our market.

Our
      success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management,
      engineering and other personnel.  The competition for qualified
      engineering and management personnel is intense.  We may be
      unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and
      retaining additional key personnel that we require.  The loss of the
      services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key
      personnel could harm our business.  We have no employment agreements
      with any member of our senior management team.  As a result of the
      anticipated impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in our first quarter
      of
      2007 would have on our results of operations, we changed our equity
      compensation program during fiscal 2006.  We now grant fewer equity
      based shares per employee and the type of equity instrument is generally
      restricted stock units rather than

stock
      options.  This change in our equity compensation program may make it
      more difficult for us to attract or retain qualified management and engineering
      personnel, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

We
      are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions
      for
      us.

We
      use
      several contractors located in Asia for a portion of the assembly and testing
      of
      our products.  We also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion
      of our wafer fabrication.  Although we own the majority of our
      manufacturing resources, the disruption or termination of any of our contractors
      could harm our business and operating results.

Our
      use
      of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the
      portions of our business that we subcontract.  Our future operating
      results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial, operations
      or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity, or if
      they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields
      and
      costs at approximately their current levels, or if due to their locations in
      foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure
      disruption.  Further, procurement from third parties is done by
      purchase order and contracts.  If these third parties are unable or
      unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality
      standards, we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for
      our products in a timely manner or at all, and such arrangements, if any, may
      not be on favorable terms to us.  In such event, we could experience
      an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing and production
      costs, decline in product reliability, and our business and operating results
      could be adversely affected.

We
      may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet
      our
      needs.

Our
      semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment
      that
      must meet exacting standards.  We generally have more than one source
      for these supplies, but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable
      of
      delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our
      standards.  The raw materials and equipment necessary for our business
      could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in
      product applications increases.  We

have
      experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion
      our
      suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders
      or
      that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and
      replacements parts.  An interruption of any raw materials or equipment
      sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment,
      could harm our business.

Our
      operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations
      of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry.

The
      semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations
      of
      supply and demand.  Since a significant portion of our revenue is from
      consumer markets and international sales, our business may be subject to
      seasonally lower revenues in particular quarters of our fiscal
      year.  However, broad strength in our overall business in recent
      periods and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact
      on our results than seasonality, and has made it difficult to assess the impact
      of seasonal factors on our business.  The industry has also experienced
      significant economic downturns, characterized by diminished product demand
      and
      production over-capacity.  We have sought to reduce our exposure to
      this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily
      or quickly replaced, to a


geographically
        diverse base of customers across a broad range of market
        segments.  However, we have experienced substantial period-to-period
        fluctuations in operating results and expect, in the future, to experience
        period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry
        or
        economic conditions.

We
      are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
      claims.

We
      are
      currently, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims
      regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, contracts and
      other
      matters.  We were involved in patent infringement litigation with
      Philips Corporation which was settled in fiscal 2005.  As is typical
      in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications from customers from
      time
      to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations
      related to infringement claims made against the customers by third
      parties.  These legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without
      merit, could result in substantial cost to us and divert our
      resources.  If we are not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a
      settlement of a matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable
      terms, reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement, and/or
      successfully prosecute or defend our position, we could incur uninsured
      liability in any of them, be required to take an appropriate charge to
      operations, be enjoined from selling a material portion of our product line
      or
      using certain processes, suffer a reduction or elimination in value of
      inventories,  and our business, financial condition or results of
      operations could be harmed.

It
      is
      also possible that from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product
      liability claims that could lead to significant expenses related to the defense
      of such claims, diversion of resources, increased costs associated with the
      replacement of affected products, lost revenue or delay in recognition of
      revenue due to cancellation of orders and unpaid receivables, customer imposed
      fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements, and a
      requirement to pay damages claims.  Because the systems into which our
      products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell,
      these expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and
      profits we received from the products involved.  While we specifically
      exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability
      to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law.  We do
      have product liability insurance, but there is no certainty that insurance
      will
      cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such
      claims.  Costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty or
      product liability claims may adversely affect the results of our
      operations.

Further,
      we sell to customers in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and medical,
      where failure of their systems could cause damage to property or persons. We
      may
      be subject to product liability claims if our products cause the system
      failures. Based on our historical experience, we believe that the risk of
      exposure to product liability claims is currently low. However, we will face
      increased exposure to product liability claims if there are substantial
      increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the
      frequency of system failures caused by our devices.

Failure
      to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue
      or
      market opportunities.

Our
      ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights
      covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our
      success.  To that end, we have acquired certain patents and patent
      licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and
      manufacturing processes.  The process of seeking patent protection can
      be long and expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending
      or
      future applications.  In addition, our existing patents and any new
      patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide
      meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us.  We may be
      subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent
      and Trademark Office, which can require significant financial and management
      resources.  In addition, the laws of certain foreign

countries
      do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws
      of the United States.  Infringement of our intellectual property
      rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue
      opportunities for us.

We
      do not typically have long-term contracts with our
      customers

.

We
      do not
      typically enter into long-term contracts with our customers and we cannot be
      certain about future order levels from our customers.  When we do
      enter into customer contracts, the contract is generally cancelable at the
      convenience of the customer.  Even though we have over 56,000 end
      customers and our ten largest customers make up approximately 10% of our total
      revenue, cancellation of long-term and short-term customer contracts could
      have
      an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits.

Further,
      as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry, we have entered
      into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of
      sale.  Under these contracts we commit to supply quantities of
      products on scheduled delivery dates.  If we become unable to supply
      the customer as required under the contract, the customer may incur additional
      production costs, lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own
      manufacturing schedule, or quality related issues.  Under these
      contracts, we may be liable for the costs the customer has
      incurred.  While we try to limit such liabilities, if they should
      arise, there may be a material adverse impact on our results of operation and
      financial condition.


Business
      interruptions could harm our business.

Operations
      at any of our manufacturing facilities, or at any of our wafer fabrication
      or
      test and assembly subcontractors, may be disrupted for reasons beyond our
      control, including work stoppages, power loss, incidents of terrorism or
      security risk, political instability, public health issues, telecommunications,
      transportation or other infrastructure failure, fire, earthquake, floods, or
      other natural disasters.  If operations at any of our facilities, or
      our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted, we may not be able to shift
      production to other facilities on a timely basis.  If this occurs, we
      would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and
      alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable
      terms.  This could result in reduced revenues and profits and the
      cancellation of orders or loss of customers.  In addition, business
      interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses
      that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business
      interruptions could significantly harm our business.

We
      are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations, which exposes us to
      foreign political and economic risks.

Sales
      to
      foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net
      sales.  During fiscal 2007 and 2006, approximately 74% of our net
      sales were made to foreign customers.  We purchase a substantial
      portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers.  In
      addition, we own product assembly and testing facilities located near Bangkok,
      Thailand.  We also use various foreign contractors for a portion of
      our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication
      requirements.  Substantially all of our finished goods inventory is
      maintained in Thailand.

Our
      reliance on foreign operations, foreign suppliers, maintenance of substantially
      all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant
      foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks, including,
      but
      not limited to:

·

political,
                  social and economic instability

·

public
                  health conditions

·

trade
                  restrictions and changes in tariffs

·

import
                  and export license requirements and
                  restrictions

·

difficulties
                  in staffing and managing international
                  operations

·

employment
                  regulations

·

disruptions
                  in international transport or
                  delivery

·

fluctuations
                  in currency exchange rates

·

difficulties
                  in collecting receivables

·

economic
                  slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us,
                  and

·

potentially
                  adverse tax consequences.

If
      any of
      these risks materialize, our sales could decrease and our operating results
      could suffer.

Interruptions
      in information technology systems could affect our
      business.

We
      rely
      on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology
      systems and networks to operate our business.  Any significant system
      or network disruption, including but not limited to computer viruses, security
      breaches,

or
      energy blackouts
      could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and operating
      results.

We have implemented measures to manage our risks
      related to such disruptions, but such disruptions could negatively impact our
      operations and financial results.  In addition, we may incur
      additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security
      breaches.

The
      occurrence of events for which we are self-insured, or which exceed our
      insurance limits may affect our profitability and
      liquidity.

We
      have
      insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many
      different types of risk; however, we self-insure for some risks and
      obligations.  In these circumstances, we have determined that it is
      more cost effective to self-insure certain risks than to pay the increased
      premium costs in place since the disruption in the insurance market after the
      events of September 11, 2001.  The risks and exposures that we
      self-insure include, but are not limited to, certain property product defects,
      political risks, and patent infringement.  Should there be a loss or
      adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are self-insured,
      then our financial condition, result of operations and liquidity may be
      adversely affected.

We
      are subject to stringent environmental regulations, which may force us to incur
      significant expenses.

We
      must
      comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental
      regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic,
      volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our products and manufacturing
      process.  Although we believe that our activities conform to presently
      applicable environmental regulations, our failure to


comply
        with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines,
        suspension of production or a cessation of operations.  Any such
        environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or
        to
        incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations.  Any
        failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge
        of
        hazardous substances could subject us to future
        liabilities.  Environmental problems may occur that could subject us
        to future costs or liabilities.

Over
      the
      past few years, there has been an expansion in environmental laws focusing
      on
      reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products.  For
      example, the EU RoHS Directive provided that beginning July 1, 2006, electronic
      products sold into Europe were required to meet stringent chemical restrictions,
      including the absence of lead.    China is adopting similar
      requirements.  The first phase of the China legislation requires labeling
      and chemical content disclosure for all electronic products sold into or within
      China after February 28, 2007.   While at this time
      our semiconductor products do not directly fall under the China
      legislation, we have complied with it in order to support our

customers' compliance
      efforts.  As the law is further implemented, we may need to take additional
      compliance activities. These laws impact our products and may make it more
      expensive to manufacture and sell our products.  It may be difficult to
      timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of
      compliant materials to meet customers’ needs, thereby adversely impacting our
      sales and profitability.

Regulatory
      authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines
      or
      restrict our ability to export products.

A
      significant portion of our sales are made outside of the United States through
      exporting and re-exporting of products.  In addition to local
      jurisdictions’ export regulations, our U.S. manufactured products or products
      based on U.S. technology are subject to Export Administration Regulations
      (“EAR”) when exported and re-exported to and from all international
      jurisdictions.  Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required
      for the shipment of our products to certain countries.  Non-compliance
      with the EAR or other export regulations can result in penalties including
      denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and seizure of
      products.  Such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our
      business including our ability to meet our net sales and earnings
      targets.

The
      future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations
      in response to a variety of factors.

The
      market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and
      is
      likely to fluctuate in the future.  The future trading price of our
      common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety
      of
      factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited
      to:

·

quarterly
                  variations in our operating results and the operating results of
                  other
                  technology companies

·

actual
                  or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products
                  by
                  us or our competitors

·

changes
                  in analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or buy/sell
                  recommendations

·

changes
                  in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such
                  guidance

·

general
                  conditions in the semiconductor industry,
                  and

·

worldwide
                  economic and financial
                  conditions.

In
      addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume
      fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high
      technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating
      performance of such companies.  These broad market fluctuations and
      other factors may harm the market price of our common stock.

The
      outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns
      by the IRS could have an adverse effect on our results of
      operations.

We
      are
      subject to continued examination of our income tax returns by the Internal
      Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood
      of
      adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy
      of
      our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes
      from
      these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future
      operating results.

In
      the event we make acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate
      such acquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits.

While
      acquisitions do not represent a major part of our growth strategy, from time
      to
      time we may consider financially attractive and strategic acquisitions if such
      opportunities arise. Any transactions that we complete may involve a number
      of
      risks, including:  the diversion of our management’s attention from
      our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired
      business, or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the
      integration process.  In addition, we may not be able to successfully
      or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage any newly acquired

operations
      or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls,
      procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational
      inefficiencies.

2.                 PROPERTIES

At
      March
      31, 2007, we owned the facilities described below:

(1)     Currently
      non-operational and being held-for-future-use.  Fab 3 consists of
      manufacturing buildings and land, with no equipment.

(2)      Located
        in the Alphatechnopolis Industrial Park near Bangkok on land to which we
        expect
        to acquire title in accordance with our agreement with the

landowner.  Progress towards
        obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due to a bankruptcy relating
        to the seller of the land.  We are currently working with the
        creditors in an attempt to reach resolution on this matter.  At this
        time it is not possible to estimate when, or if, full title transfer will
        be
        completed.  We have provided reserves that we estimate will be
        adequate to obtain full title.  Such reserves are set at the estimated
        fair value of the land.

In
        addition to the facilities we own, we lease several research and development
        facilities and sales offices in North America, Europe and Asia.  Our
        aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately
        $0.4 million.

We
        currently believe that
        our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our production requirements
        for
        the next 12 months.

LEGAL
                    PROCEEDINGS

In
        the
        ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal
        actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability
        in
        any one or more of them.  Although the outcome of these actions is not
        presently determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these
        matters
        will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect on
        our
        financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  Litigation
        relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon, and we are, and from
        time to time have been, subject to such litigation.  No assurances can
        be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in
        the
        future.

        quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share, which will be paid on May 24,
        to stockholders of record on May 10, 2007 and the total amount of such dividend
        is expected to be $60.9 million.  Our Board is free to change its
        dividend practices at any time and to decrease or increase the dividend paid,
        or
        not to pay a dividend, on our common stock on the basis of our results of
        operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects,
        and
        other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  Our current intent is to
        provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions
        and our results of operations.

On
        October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up
        to
        10,000,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or privately negotiated

Closure
        of Fab 1

On
        April
        7, 2003, we announced our intention to close our Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1)
        wafer
        fabrication facility and integrate certain Fab 1 personnel and processes
        into
        its Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) wafer fabrication facility.  We completed
        this integration process during the three-month period ended June 30,
        2003.  The closure of Fab 1 and the integration of certain Fab 1
        personnel into Fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of 207
        employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing operations
        or
        provided support functions to Fab 1.  The detail of the charges
        incurred related to the closure of Fab 1 that were included in cost of
        sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003 is as follows (amounts
        in
        thousands):

The
        facility where Fab 1
        was located is an integral part of our overall campus in Chandler,
        Arizona.  Within this same facility resides our wafer probe, mask
        making and other manufacturing related activities.  Consequently it is
        not possible to abandon or otherwise dispose of this facility.  We
        have accelerated depreciation that was taken only related to assets used
        in the
        wafer fabrication operations at the facility.  We have no specific
        plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations,
        and intend to leave it in an idle state.  The property, plant and
        equipment that was subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in
        the
        gross and accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property, plant
        and
        equipment section of the our balance sheet and related footnote
        disclosures.

We
        incurred $865,000 of special charges recorded principally for contract
        cancellation, severance and other costs related to the closure of Fab 1 and
        other actions.

Fab
        Impairment Charge

During
        the September 2002 quarter, we recorded a $41.5 million asset impairment
        charge
        as described below.


During
        July 2000, we acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Puyallup,
        Washington, referred to as Fab 3.  The original purchase consisted of
        semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real property.  It was our
        intention to bring Fab 3 to productive readiness and commence volume production
        of 8-inch wafers using its 0.7 and 0.5 micron process technologies by August
        2001.  Due to deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor
        industry during fiscal 2002, we delayed the intended production start up
        of Fab
        3.  Fab 3 has never been brought to productive readiness.

In
        August
        2002, we acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon,
        referred to as Fab 4.  After the acquisition of Fab 4 was completed,
        we undertook an analysis of the potential production capacity at Fab
        4.  The results of the production capacity analysis at that time led
        us to determine that Fab 3’s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable
        future and during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we committed to a plan
        to
        sell Fab 3.  Subsequently, we retained a third-party broker to market
        Fab 3 on our behalf and began actively seeking potential
        buyers.  Accordingly, Fab 3 was classified as an asset held-for-sale
        as of September 30, 2002 and maintained that classification until March 31,
        2005.

Management
        determined the value assigned to the Fab 3 assets through various methods
        including assistance from a third-party appraisal.  The independent
        third party used the market approach and considered sales of comparable
        properties in determining the fair value of Fab 3.  The comparable
        sales included eight properties, including our purchases of Fab 3 in July
        and Fab 4 in August 2002.  Based on the results of this appraisal, we
        recorded an asset impairment charge on Fab 3 of $36.9 million, including
        estimated costs to sell.  The remaining value of $60.2 million was
        classified as an asset held-for-sale and was included as a component of other
        current assets until March 31, 2005.

During
        the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we recorded an asset impairment charge
        of
        $4.6 million to write-down certain excess manufacturing equipment located
        at Fab
        3 to its net realizable value of $0.2 million.  This manufacturing
        equipment became “excess” as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the
        purchase of Fab 4.  The net realizable value for the excess
        manufacturing equipment was determined based on management
        estimates.  Substantially all of the other manufacturing equipment
        located at Fab 3 has been transferred to and either will be or is
        being used in our other wafer fabrication facilities located in Tempe,
        Arizona (Fab 2) and Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).

At
        March
        31, 2005, we changed the classification of Fab 3 from an asset held-for-sale
        to
        an asset held-for-future-use.  Fab 3 had been on the market for over
        two years, and we had not received any acceptable offers on the
        facility.  Over that period of time, our business had increased
        significantly and over the next several years we will need to begin planning
        for
        future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of Fab 4’s clean room
        capacity is utilized.  We determined that the appropriate action to
        take was to stop actively marketing the Fab 3 facility and hold it for its
        future use.  As a result of this change in classification, we had to
        assess the fair value of the Fab 3 asset to determine if any additional
        impairment charge was required upon the change in classification from
“held-for-sale” to “held-for-future-use” under Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,

Accounting For the Impairment or Disposal of
        Long-Lived Assets

.  We performed a discounted cash flow analysis
        of the Fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the
        fair
        value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for
        the
        asset.  The discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value
        of the Fab 3 asset at March 31, 2005 was not in excess of its fair
        value.  We began to depreciate the Fab 3 asset in April
        2005.

PowerSmart
        In-Process Research and Development Charge

On
        June
        5, 2002, we completed the acquisition of PowerSmart, Inc. in which we acquired
        all of PowerSmart’s outstanding capital stock and assumed certain stock options
        for consideration of $54.0 million in cash plus other acquisition-related
        costs
        of $1.2 million.  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
        business combination in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business
        Combinations,

and accordingly, the results of PowerSmart’s operations are
        included in our

consolidated
        results from the date of the acquisition.  The acquisition was not
        considered significant under the rules and regulations of the SEC (Rule 3-05
        of
        Regulation S-X).

The
        purchase price was allocated among PowerSmart’s tangible and intangible assets,
        in-process research and development and goodwill.  Management
        determined the value assigned to the assets acquired through various methods
        including assistance from a third-party appraisal.  An allocation of
        $9.3 million of the purchase price was assigned to in-process research and
        development and was written off at the date of the acquisition.  The
        amount paid in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets was allocated
        to separately identifiable intangible assets based upon an independent valuation
        analysis.  An allocation of $5.6 million of the purchase price was
        made to core technology and other identifiable intangible assets and is being
        amortized over an estimated useful life of seven years.  An allocation
        of approximately $32.3 million of the purchase price was made to
        goodwill.  None of the goodwill is deductible for tax
        purposes.  The goodwill related to the PowerSmart acquisition was
        reduced by $0.4 million to $31.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2005
        due to
        a favorable settlement of a liability that was recorded as of the original
        acquisition date.

Introduction

The
        following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed
        consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere
        in
        this document, as well as with other sections of this Annual Report on Form
        10-K, including “Item 1

        Data.”

We
        begin
        our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations (MD&A) with a summary of Microchip’s overall business strategy to
        give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall
        direction of our business and products.  This is followed by a
        discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe
        are
        important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in
        our
        reported financial results.  In the next section, beginning at page
        27, we discuss our Results of Operations for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal
        2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005.  We then provide an
        analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our
        financial commitments in sections titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources,”
“Contractual Obligations” and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.”

Strategy

Our
        goal
        is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products
        for
        a wide variety of embedded control applications.  Our strategic focus is on
        embedded control products, which include microcontrollers, high-performance
        linear and mixed signal devices, power management and thermal management
        devices, interface devices, Serial EEPROMs, and our patented K

EE

L

OQ

security
        devices.  We provide highly cost-effective embedded control products that
        also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, low voltage/power
        operation and ease of development, enabling timely and cost-effective embedded
        control product integration by our customers.

Our
        manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test. 
The ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of
        our
        business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing
        control
        resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control
        industry.  By owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our
        assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical process control
        techniques, we have been able to achieve and maintain high production
        yields.  Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten
        our design and production cycles.  This control also allows us to capture
        the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit
        margin.

We
        employ
        proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded
        control products.  We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective
        designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in
        new
        product designs.  While many of our competitors develop and optimize
        separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common
        process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory
        products.  This allows us to more fully leverage our process research and
        development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly.  Our
        engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and software
        to
        perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask
        and
        wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques
        by
        processing test wafers quickly and efficiently.

We
        are
        committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including
        development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process
        technologies.  We believe these investments are significant factors in
        maintaining our competitive position.  Our current research and development
        activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal
        controllers, memory and mixed-signal products, new development systems, software
        and application-specific software libraries.  We are also developing new
        design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and
        performance improvements in existing products.

We
        market
        our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel
        and
        distributors.  Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product
        and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. 
We believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors
        provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer
        base.  Our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts
        in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently
        maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in North America,
        Europe and Asia.  We believe that a strong technical service presence is
        essential to the continued development of the embedded control market. 
Many of our field sales engineers (FSEs), field application engineers (FAEs),
        and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed
        in
        an engineering environment.  We believe that the technical knowledge of our
        sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products. 
The primary mission of our FAE team is to provide technical assistance to
        strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for FSEs and
        distributor sales teams.  FAEs also frequently conduct technical seminars
        for our customers in major cities around the world, and work closely with
        our
        distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.


Critical
        Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our
        discussion and analysis of Microchip’s financial condition and results of
        operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have
        been
        prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
        United States of America.  We review the accounting policies we use in
        reporting our financial results on a regular basis.  The preparation of
        these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
        affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
        and
        related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we
        evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
        share-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, property plant and
        equipment, impairment of property, plant and equipment and litigation.  We
        base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
        that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
        which
        form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and
        liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Results may
        differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those
        on
        which we based our assumptions.  We review these estimates and judgments on
        an ongoing basis.  We believe the following critical accounting policies
        affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
        of
        our consolidated financial statements.  We also have other policies that we
        consider key accounting policies, such as our policy regarding revenue
        recognition to OEMs; however, we do not believe these policies require us
        to
        make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies
        described below.

Revenue
        Recognition

–

Distributors

Our
        distributors worldwide have broad rights to return products and price protection
        rights, so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product
        to their customers.  We reduce product pricing through price protection
        based on market conditions, competitive considerations and other factors. 
Price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have
        on
        hand at the date the price protection is offered.  When we reduce the price
        of our products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its
        outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory
        it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue
        impact to us from the price protections.  We also grant certain credits to
        our distributors.  The credits are granted to the distributors on specially
        identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a
        competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end
        customers.  The credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the
        distributor until they provide documentation of the sale to their end
        customer.  The effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling
        price from us to our distributors for the product and results in the net
        revenue
        recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end
        customers.  Upon our shipment to distributors, amounts billed are included
        as accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, and the sale and the gross
        margin
        are deferred and are reflected as a current liability until the product is
        sold
        by the distributor to their customers.

Share-based
        Compensation

In
        the
        first quarter of fiscal 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires
        the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for
        all
        share-based payment awards, including grants of employee stock options, RSUs
        and
        employee stock purchase rights, to be recognized in our financial statements
        based on their respective grant date fair values.  Total share-based
        compensation in fiscal 2007 was $30.7 million, of which $24.1 million
        was reflected in operating expenses, $3.3 million was reflected in cost of
        goods sold and $3.3 million was capitalized to inventory.

Determining
          the
          appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of share-based
          awards at the date of grant requires judgment.  The fair value of our RSUs
          is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant
          discounted for expected future dividends. We use the Black-Scholes option
          pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and
          rights to
          purchase shares under stock participation plans, consistent with the provisions
          of SFAS No. 123R.  Option pricing models, including the
          Black-Scholes model, also require the use of input assumptions, including
          expected volatility, expected life, expected dividend rate, and expected
          risk-free rate of return.  We use a blend of historical and implied
          volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe
          this
          is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected
          volatility than using purely historical volatility.  The expected life of
          the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into
          the
          future. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest
          rates appropriate for the terms of our awards.  The dividend yield
          assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts.
           SFAS No. 123R requires us to develop an estimate of the number
          of share-based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover.
           Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant
          effect on reported share-based compensation, as the effect of adjusting
          the rate
          for all expense amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the period
          the
          forfeiture estimate is changed.  If the actual forfeiture rate is higher
          than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase
          the
          estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense
          recognized in the financial statements.  If the actual forfeiture rate is
          lower than the estimated forfeiture rate,


then
          an
          adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will
          result
          in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements.  If
          forfeiture adjustments are made, they would affect our gross margin, research
          and development expenses, and selling, general, administrative expenses.
           The effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2007 was
          immaterial.

We
        evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis.  If
        factors change and we employ different assumptions, share-based compensation
        expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. 
If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested
        securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining
        unearned share-based compensation expense.  Future share-based compensation
        expense and unearned share-based compensation will increase to the extent
        that
        we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity
        awards in connection with acquisitions.  Had we adopted
        SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the magnitude of the impact of that
        standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact
        of
        SFAS No. 123 assuming the application of the Black-Scholes option
        pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and
        pro
        forma net income per share in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial
        Statements.

Inventories

Inventories
        are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out
        method.  We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or
        unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost
        of
        inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
        demand and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less
        favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be
        required.  Inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for
        inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if
        circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are
        recoverable.  In estimating our inventory obsolescence, we primarily
        evaluate estimates of demand over a 12-month period and record impairment
        charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month
        demand.

Income
        Taxes

As
        part
        of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are
        required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
        we
        operate.  This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure
        together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment
        of items for tax and accounting purposes.  These differences result in
        deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated
        balance sheet.  We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax
        assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant
        jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we
        must
        establish a valuation allowance.  We have not provided for a valuation
        allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred
        tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income.  Should we
        determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net

deferred
        tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be
        charged to income in the period such determination was made.  At
        March 31, 2007, our gross deferred tax asset was
        $62.0 million.

Various
        taxing authorities in the United States and other countries in which we do
        business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by
        businesses.  Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by
        the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant
        operations.  We are currently under audit by the United States Internal
        Revenue Service (“IRS”) for our fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and
        2004.  We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
        United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether,
        and
        the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable.  We believe that
        we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities
        that
        may arise upon these and other pending audits in the United States and other
        countries in which we do business.  If such amounts ultimately prove to be
        unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax
        benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
        necessary.  If such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate
        assessment, a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in
        which
        the assessment is determined.

Property,
        Plant & Equipment

Property,
        plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Major renewals and improvements
        are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. 
At March 31, 2007, the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled
        $605.7 million, which represents 26.7% of our total assets.  This
        carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting
        policies, which incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments relative
        to the
        useful lives of our property and equipment.  Depreciation is provided on a
        straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
        which
        range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately
        years on buildings.


We
        began
        production activities at Fab 4 on October 31, 2003.  We began to depreciate
        the Fab 4 assets as they were placed in service for production purposes. 
As of March 31, 2007, all of the buildings and supporting facilities were
        being
        depreciated as well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in
        service.  All manufacturing equipment that was

not
        being
        used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and is
        not
        being depreciated until it is placed into service since management believes
        there will be no change to its utility from the present time until it is
        placed
        into productive service.  The lives to be used for depreciating this
        equipment at Fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed
        in
        service.  We do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has
        impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying
        assets.

On
        March
        31, 2005, we changed the classification of Fab 3 from an asset held-for-sale
        to
        an asset held-for-future-use.  Fab 3 had been on the market for over two
        years, and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility.  Over
        that period of time, our business had increased significantly and over the
        next
        several years we will need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication
        capacity as a larger percentage of Fab 4’s clean room capacity is
        utilized.  We determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop
        actively marketing the Fab 3 facility and hold it for our future use.  As a
        result of this change in classification, we had to assess the fair value
        of the
        Fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required
        upon
        the change in classification from “held-for-sale” to “held-for-future-use” under
        SFAS No. 144.  We performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Fab 3
        asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value
        estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the
        asset.  The discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of
        the Fab 3 asset at March 31, 2005 was not in excess of its fair value.  If
        indicators of impairment for the Fab 3 assets arise in the future, we will
        determine if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable
        to
        the assets in question are less than their carrying value.  If less, we
        would recognize an impairment loss on the excess of the carrying amount of
        the
        assets over their respective fair values.  We began to depreciate the Fab 3
        asset in April 2005.

The
        estimates, assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property
        and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations
        regarding future industry conditions and operations.  The use of different
        estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property
        and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and
        operations, could result in materially different carrying values of assets
        and
        results of operations.

We
        do not
        currently hold title to the land on which our Thailand facility resides. 
The land is subject to a bankruptcy relating to the seller of the land.  We
        are currently working with the creditors in attempts to reach resolution
        on this
        matter.  We have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate
        to obtain full title.  Such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of
        the land.  However, timing of the resolution is difficult to predict and
        the ultimate amount to be paid could change.

Impairment
        of Property, Plant and Equipment

We
        assess
        whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present.  If such
        indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated
        undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than
        their carrying value.  If less, we recognize an impairment loss based on
        the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair
        values.  Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows,
        appraisals or other methods.  If the assets determined to be impaired are
        to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to
        our
        operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash
        flows
        attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value, which we
        depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. We may
        incur
        impairment losses, or additional losses on already impaired assets, in future
        periods if factors influencing our estimates change.

Litigation

Our
        current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based
        on
        the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range
        of
        loss.  Recorded reserves were immaterial at March 31, 2007.

Because
        of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount
        and
        range of loss on our pending litigation, we are unable to make a reasonable
        estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome. 
As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential
        liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. 
Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact
        our results of operation and financial position.


Results
        of Operations

The
        following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net
        sales
        for the years indicated:

Net
        Sales

We
        operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design, development,
        manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products.  We sell our
        products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers, referred to
        as
        OEMs, in a broad range of market segments, perform ongoing credit evaluations
        of
        our customers and generally require no collateral.

Our
        net
        sales of $1,039.7 million in fiscal 2007 increased by $111.8 million, or
        10.8%,
        over fiscal 2006, and net sales of $927.9 million in fiscal 2006 increased
        by
        $81.0 million, or 9.6%, over fiscal 2005.  The increases in net sales
        in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
        2005 resulted primarily from increased demand, predominantly for our proprietary
        microcontroller and analog products.  Average selling prices for our
        products were flat in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 and down approximately
        4% in
        fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005.  The number of units of our products
        sold was up approximately 12% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 and approximately
        14% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005.  The average selling prices and
        the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold
        and
        overall semiconductor market conditions.  We believe that we have
        continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control
        market
        over the last three fiscal years.  Key factors in achieving the amount
        of net sales during the last three fiscal years include:

·

continued
                  market share gains;

·

increasing
                  semiconductor content in our customers’
                  products;

·

customers’
                  increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable
                  solutions;

·

our
                  new product offerings that have increased our served available
                  market;

·

increasing
                  demand for our products;

·

economic
                  conditions in the markets we serve;
                  and

·

inventory
                  holding patterns of our customers.

We
        recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to OEMs.  Under our
        shipping terms, legal title generally passes to the customer upon shipment
        from
        Microchip.  We have no post shipment
        obligations.  Distributors worldwide generally have broad rights to
        return products and price protection rights, so we defer revenue recognition
        until the distributors sell the product to their customers.  Upon
        shipment, amounts billed to distributors are included in accounts receivable,
        inventory is relieved, the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected
        as
        a current liability until the product is sold by the distributors to their
        customers.

Sales
        by
        product line for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
        as
        follows (dollars in thousands):

Microcontrollers

Our
        microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total
        net
        sales.  Microcontrollers and associated application development
        systems accounted for approximately 80.2% of our total net sales in fiscal
        2007,
        approximately 79.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately
        79.7% of our total net sales in fiscal 2005.


Net
        sales
        of our microcontroller products increased approximately 13.3% in fiscal 2007
        compared to fiscal 2006, and increased approximately 9.1% in fiscal 2006
        compared to fiscal 2005.  The increases in net sales were primarily
        due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets,
        driven
        principally by market share gains and those factors described above under
“Net
        Sales” at page 27.  The end markets that we serve include the
        consumer, automotive, industrial control, communications and computing control
        markets.

Historically,
        average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life
        of
        any particular product.  The overall average selling prices of our
        microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due
        to the
        proprietary nature of these products.  We have experienced, and expect
        to continue to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller
        product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions.  We have in
        the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average
        selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing
        new
        products with more features and higher prices.  We may be unable to
        maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result
        of
        increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our
        operating results.

Memory
        Products

Sales
        of
        our memory products accounted for approximately 11.8% of our total net sales
        in
        fiscal 2007, approximately 13.5% of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 and
        approximately 13.6% of our total net sales in fiscal 2005.

Net
        sales
        of our memory products decreased approximately 2.1% in fiscal 2007 compared
        to
        fiscal 2006, and increased approximately 8.9% in fiscal 2006 compared to
        fiscal
        2005, driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the Serial EEPROM
        market, which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net
        sales.

Serial
        EEPROM product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature, with steep
        price declines followed by periods of relative price stability, driven by
        changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business
        cycle.  We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
        varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our Serial EEPROM
        products.  We may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of
        our Serial EEPROM products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the
        future, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Analog
        and Interface Products

Sales
        of
        our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 8.0% of our
        total
        net sales in fiscal 2007, 7.2% of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 and
        approximately 6.7% of our total net sales in fiscal 2005.

Net
        sales
        of our analog and interface products increased approximately 24.5% in fiscal
        2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and increased approximately 16.6% in fiscal
        compared to fiscal 2005.  The increase in net sales of our analog and
        interface products in these periods were driven primarily by market share
        gains
        and supply and demand conditions within the analog and interface
        market.

Analog
        and interface products can be proprietary or non-proprietary in
        nature.  Currently, we consider more than half of our analog and
        interface product mix to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively
        stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller
        products.  The non-proprietary portion of our analog and interface
        business will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current
        supply and demand for those products.  We may be unable to maintain
        the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result
        of
        increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our
        operating results.  We anticipate the proprietary portion of our
        analog and interface products will increase over time.

Distribution

Distributors
        accounted for 65% of our net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Our
        largest distributor accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales in fiscal
        2007, approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal
        2005.  Our two largest distributors together accounted for 21% of our
        net sales in fiscal 2007, 24% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 25% of
        our net
        sales in 2005.

Generally,
        we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our
        distributors, may terminate their relationships with us with little or no
        advanced notice.  The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of,
        one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given
        quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.

At
        March
        31, 2007, distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 1.8 months
        of inventory of our products calculated based on the prior three months of
        their sell through activity.  Over the past three fiscal years, the
        months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between
        approximately 1.8 months and 2.5 months.  Thus, inventory levels at
        our distributors are at the low end of the range we have experienced over
        the
        last three years.  We do not believe that


inventory
          holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales,
          due
          to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sell through for all of
          our
          distributors.

Distributors
        generally have broad-based rights to return product to us.  As revenue
        on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our
        product on to their end customers, distributor returns have no impact on
        our
        revenue recognition.

We
        also
        grant certain credits to our distributors and also offer these distributors
        price protection.  The credits are granted to the distributors on
        specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to
        earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end
        customers.  The credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to
        the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their
        end
        customer.  The effect of granting these credits establishes the net
        selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in
        the
        net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors
        to
        their end customers.

We
        reduce
        product pricing through price protection based on market conditions, competitive
        considerations and other factors.  Price protection is granted to
        distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price
        protection is offered.  When we reduce the selling price of our
        products, it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding
        accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it
        has on
        hand as of the date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue
        recognition impact from the price protection.

We
        do not
        offer material incentive programs to our distributors.

Sales
        by Geography

Sales
        by
        geography for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as
        follows (dollars in thousands):

Our
        sales to foreign
        customers have been predominately in Asia and Europe, which we attribute
        to the
        manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive, communications, computing,
        consumer and industrial control products.  Americas sales include
        sales to customers in the United States, Canada, Central America and South
        America.

Sales
        to
        foreign customers accounted for approximately 74% of our net sales in fiscal
        2007, 74% of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 73% of our net sales in fiscal
        2005.  Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar
        denominated.

Sales
        to
        customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 18%
        of our
        net sales in fiscal 2007 and approximately 17% of our net sales in fiscal
        and 2005.  Sales to customers in Taiwan accounted for approximately
        10% of our net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.  We did not have
        sales into any other countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during
        the
        last three fiscal years.

Gross
        Profit

Our
        gross
        profit was $624.8 million in fiscal 2007, $550.9 million in fiscal 2006 and
        $484.0 million in fiscal 2005.  Gross profit as a percent of sales was
        60.1% in fiscal 2007, 59.4% in fiscal 2006 and 57.1% in fiscal
        2005.

The
        most
        significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage over the past three
        fiscal years were:

·

increased
                  cost of sales of $3.3 million in fiscal 2007 associated with share-based
                  compensation expense under SFAS No.
                  123R.

·

fluctuations
                  in the product mix of microcontrollers, proprietary and non-proprietary
                  analog products and Serial EEPROM products resulting in higher
                  average
                  selling prices for our products.

·

continual
                  cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing
                  such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing
                  techniques.


Other
        factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered
        by this
        report include:

·

changes
                  in capacity utilization and absorption of fixed
                  costs,

·

gross
                  profit on products sold through the distribution
                  channel,

·

depreciation
                  expense as a percentage of cost of sales,
                  and

·

inventory
                  write-offs and the sale of inventory that was previously written
                  off.

During
        fiscal 2007, we operated at approximately 99% of our Fab 2
        capacity.  During fiscal 2006, we operated at approximately 98% of our
        Fab 2 capacity.  Our utilization of Fab 4’s total capacity is at
        relatively low levels although we are utilizing all of the installed equipment
        base.  We expect to maintain the current level of capacity utilization
        at Fab 2 during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and to modestly increase
        the
        current level of capacity utilization at Fab 4 during the first quarter of
        fiscal 2008.

The
        process technologies utilized impact our gross margins.  Fab 2
        currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies, but predominantly
        utilizes our 0.5 to 1.0 micron processes.  At March 31, 2007, Fab 4
        predominantly utilized our 0.5 micron process technology.  We continue
        to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future
        manufacturing costs.  All of our production has been on 8-inch wafers
        during the periods covered by this report.

Our
        overall inventory levels were $121.0 million at March 31, 2007, compared
        to
        $115.0 million at March 31, 2006 and $103.7 million at March 31,
        2005.  We maintained 107 days of inventory on our balance sheet at
        March 31, 2007 compared to 106 days of inventory at March 31, 2006 and 107
        days
        at March 31, 2005.

We
        anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily
        by
        the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog and interface and memory
        products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a
        particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption,
        capacity utilization levels, particularly those at Fab 4, and competitive
        and economic conditions.

At
        March
        31, 2007, approximately 72% of our assembly requirements were performed in
        our
        Thailand facility, compared to approximately 66% as of March 31, 2006 and
        approximately 70% at March 31, 2005.  Contractors located in Asia
        perform the balance of our assembly operations.  Substantially all of
        our test requirements were performed in our Thailand facility over the last
        three fiscal years.  We believe that the assembly and test operations
        performed at our Thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings
        when
        compared to contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control
        over these portions of the manufacturing process.

We
        rely
        on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication
        requirements.

Our
        use
        of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the
        portions of our business that we subcontract.  While we review the
        quality, delivery and cost performance of our third party contractors, our
        future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor is unable
        to
        maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at
        approximately their current levels.

Research
        and Development (R&D)

R&D
        expenses for fiscal 2007 were $113.7 million, or 10.9% of sales, compared
        to
        $94.9 million, or 10.2% of sales, for fiscal 2006 and $93.0 million, or 11.0%
        of
        sales, for fiscal 2005.  We are committed to investing in new and
        enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design
        and
        manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are
        significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  We
        expense all R&D costs as incurred.  R&D expenses include
        labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development
        of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products
        and
        design environments.

R&D
        expenses increased $18.8 million, or 19.8%, for fiscal 2007 over fiscal
        2006.  The primary reasons for the dollar increase in R&D costs in
        fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was higher labor costs as a result of
        expanding our internal R&D headcount, increases in bonuses and $9.6 million
        of share-based compensation as a result of the adoption of SFAS
        No. 123R.  R&D expenses increased $1.9 million, or 2.0%, for
        fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005.  The primary reasons for the dollar
        increase in R&D costs in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 were higher
        labor and recruitment costs as a result of expanding our technical resources
        and
        increases in bonuses.

Selling,
        General and Administrative

Selling,
        general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 were
        $163.2

million, or 15.7% of sales, compared to
        $129.6 million, or 14.0% of sales, for fiscal 2006, and
        $111.2 million, or 13.1% of sales, for fiscal 2005.  Selling,
        general and


administrative
          expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and
          administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and
          legal
          expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also include
          costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers
          who
          work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers
          in
          the selection and use of our products.

Selling,
        general and administrative expenses increased
        $33.7

million, or 26.0%, for fiscal 2007 over fiscal
        2006.  The primary reasons for the dollar increases in selling,
        general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 were
        higher
        labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources involved in the
        technical aspects of selling our products, increases in bonuses and
        $14.5 million of share-based compensation as a result of the adoption of
        SFAS No. 123R.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
        $18.4 million, or 16.5%, for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005.  The
        primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling, general and administrative
        expenses in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 were higher labor costs as a result
        of
        expanding our internal resources, increases in bonuses and increases in travel
        expenses.

Selling,
        general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to
        revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Special
        Charges

In
        fiscal
        2005, we reached an agreement with U.S. Philips Corporation and Philips
        Electronics North America Corp. (together “Philips”) regarding patent license
        litigation between Philips and ourselves.  The agreement included
        dismissal of the then pending litigation and the cross-license of certain
        patents between Philips and Microchip.  We recorded a special charge
        of $21.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2004 associated with this
        matter.  As part of the settlement, we licensed certain of our patents
        related to 8-pin microcontrollers to Philips, and Philips licensed its patents
        related to I


C
        serial communications to us, each on fully-paid up, non-royalty bearing
        worldwide licenses.  The definitive agreement related to this matter
        was finalized and executed, and we made a cash payment to Philips during
        our
        fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2004.

There
        were no special charges in fiscal 2007 or 2006.

Other
          Income (Expense)

Interest
        income in fiscal 2007 increased from interest income in fiscal 2006 as our
        average invested balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2007 compared to
        fiscal 2006, and we earned a higher interest rate on our invested
        balances.  Interest income in fiscal 2006 increased from interest
        income in fiscal 2005 as our average invested balances were at higher levels
        in
        fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, and we earned a higher interest rate
        on our
        invested balances.

Provision
            for Income Taxes

Provisions
        for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state
        tax
        on our U.S. earnings.  Our effective tax rate was 11.0% in fiscal
        2007, 32.5% in fiscal 2006 and 22.9% in fiscal 2005, and is lower than statutory
        rates in the United States due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign
        locations, R&D tax credits and export sales incentives.  Our
        effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 reflects a $52.2 million benefit related
        to a tax settlement for our fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2001 tax years that
        occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which decreased our effective
        tax
        rate for fiscal 2007 by 13.0%.  Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006
        reflects a $30.6 million tax expense related to the repatriation of $500
        million
        of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (the “Jobs Act”) that
        was effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 which increased our effective
        tax rate in fiscal 2006 by 8.5%.  We expect our effective tax rate for
        fiscal 2008 to be approximately 20%.

Various
        taxing authorities in the United States and other countries in which we do
        business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by
        businesses.  Companies of our size and complexity are regularly
        audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct
        significant operations.  We are currently under audit by the IRS for
        our fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  We recognize
        liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other
        tax
        jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
        additional tax payments are probable.  We believe that we maintain
        adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise
        upon these and other pending audits in the United States and other countries
        in
        which we do business.  If such amounts ultimately prove to be
        unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax
        benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
        necessary.  If such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final
        assessment, a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in
        which
        the assessment is determined.

Our
        Thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays
        that have been granted to us by the Thailand government based on our investments
        in property, plant and equipment in Thailand.  Our tax holiday periods
        in Thailand expire at various times in the future.  One of our
        Thailand tax holidays expired in September 2006 and the


expiration
          did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate.  We do not
          expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand
          to
          have a material impact on our overall effective tax rate.  Any
          expiration of tax holidays are expected to have a minimal impact on our
          overall
          tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other
          taxing
          jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

We
        had
        $1,278.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term
        investments at March 31, 2007, a decrease of $6.7 million from the March
        31,
        2006 balance. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and
        long-term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to
        a
        $269.0 million pay down of short-term debt offset by cash generated from
        operating activities.

Net
        cash
        provided from operating activities was $429.8 million for fiscal 2007, $437.3
        million for fiscal 2006 and $352.7 million for fiscal 2005. The increase
        in cash
        flow from operations was primarily due to increases in net income and changes
        in
        accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Accrued income taxes
        reduced by $60.4 million and accounts payable reduced by $16.2 million in
        fiscal 2007.

Net
        cash
        used in investing activities was $442.2 million for fiscal 2007,
        $136.6 million for fiscal 2006 and $370.7 million in fiscal
        2005.  The increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal
        2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases,
        sales
        and maturities of investments.  The increase in cash used in investing
        activities in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was primarily due to changes in
        our
        net purchases, sales and maturities of investments.

Our
        level
        of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and
        anticipated business conditions.  Capital expenditures were
        $60.0 million in fiscal 2007, $76.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $63.2
        million in fiscal 2005.  The primary reason for the dollar differences
        in capital expenditures in the periods covered by this report related to
        requirements for funding capital expansion activities in our manufacturing
        operations.  We currently intend to spend approximately $80 million
        during the next 12 months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain,
        and
        selectively increase, capacity to meet our currently anticipated
        needs.

We
        expect
        to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash
        flows from operations.  We believe that the capital expenditures
        anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient
        manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs.

Net
        cash
        used in financing activities was $385.3 million for fiscal 2007.  Net
        cash provided by financing activities was $195.8

million
        for fiscal 2006.  Net cash used in financing activities was
        $18.6 million for fiscal 2005.  Proceeds from the sale of stock,
        the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock
        purchase plan were $68.7

million
        for fiscal 2007, $95.8 million for fiscal 2006 and $47.2 million for fiscal
        2005.  Cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was $0 in
        fiscal 2007, $3.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $68.3 million in fiscal
        2005.  We had short-term borrowings of $0 at March 31, 2007, $269.0
        million at March 31, 2006 and $45.5 million at March 31, 2005.  The
        short-term borrowings of $269.0 million at March 31, 2006 relate to transactions
        associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the Jobs
        Act.  During fiscal 2007, we paid down $269.0 million in
        short-term borrowings.  During fiscal 2006, we paid down $45.5 million
        in short-term borrowings and initiated new borrowings of $269.0
        million.  To complete the repatriation of $500 million in fiscal 2006,
        we initiated the $269.0 million in borrowings, which were collateralized
        against
        investments that were held in the foreign locations, allowing the investments
        to
        reach their normal maturity date.  The short-term debt was a result of
        repurchase agreements that were in place with two investment
        firms.  Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R on April 1,
        2006, we began reporting the excess tax benefit from share-based payment
        arrangements as a cash flow from financing activities rather than a cash
        flow
        from operating activities.  The excess tax benefit from share-based
        payment arrangements was $22.8 million in fiscal 2007.

On
        April
        22, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2,500,000
        shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated
        transactions.  As of March 31, 2007, we had repurchased 1,004,834
        common shares under this authorization for a total of $26.6
        million.  On October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
        repurchase of up to an additional 10,000,000 shares of our common stock in
        the
        open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As of March 31,
        2007, no shares had been purchased under this authorization.  As of
        March 31, 2007, all of the purchased shares under our authorized repurchase
        programs had been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under
        our employee stock purchase plan.  The timing and amount of any future
        repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate
        considerations.

On
        October 28, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and
        instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.  The initial
        quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share was paid on December 6, 2003 in the
        amount
        of $4.0 million.  We have continued to pay quarterly dividends
        and have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular
        basis.  During fiscal 2005, we paid dividends in the amount of $0.208
        per share for a total dividend payment of $43.0 million.  During
        fiscal 2006, we paid dividends in the amount of $0.57 per share for a total
        dividend payment of $120.1 million.  During fiscal 2007, we paid
        dividends in the amount of $0.965 per share for a total dividend payment of
        $207.9 million.  On


April
          26,
          2007, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share, which will
          be
          paid on May 24, 2007, to stockholders of record on May 10, 2007 and the
          total
          amount of such dividend is expected to be $60.9 million.  Our
          Board is free to change its dividend practices at any time and to decrease
          or
          increase the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend, on our common stock
          on the
          basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements
          and
          future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  Our
          current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending
          upon
          market conditions and our results of operations.

We
        enter
        into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure
        to currency rate fluctuations.  Although none of the countries in
        which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary
        economy in the last five years, there is no assurance that inflation rates
        or
        fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations
        will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.  We had
        no hedging transactions outstanding at March 31, 2007.

We
        believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated
        from
        operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash
        requirements for at least the next 12 months.  However, the
        semiconductor industry is capital intensive.  In order to remain
        competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant
        investments in capital equipment for both production and research and
        development.  We may seek additional equity or debt financing from
        time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly
        and test facilities, or for other purposes.  The timing and amount of
        any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including
        demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, and
        competitive factors.  There can be no assurance that such financing
        will be available on acceptable terms, and any additional equity financing
        would
        result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing
        stockholders.

Contractual
        Obligations

The
        following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March
        31,
        2007, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity
        and
        cash flows in future periods.  This table excludes amounts already
        recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at March 31, 2007 (dollars
        in thousands):

(1)

Capital
                  purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or
                  purchases
                  of property, plant and equipment.  They are not recorded as
                  liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2007, as we have
                  not yet
                  received the related goods or taken title to the
                  property.

(2)

Other
                  purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under
                  various
                  types of licenses.

(3)

Total
                  contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations
                  recorded on
                  the balance sheet as current liabilities, or certain purchase obligations
                  as discussed below

.

Purchase
        orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and
        services are not included in the table above.  We are not able to
        determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent
        contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations
        to
        purchase rather than binding agreements.  For the purpose of this
        table, contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined
        as
        agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Microchip and that
        specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to
        be
        purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate
        timing of the transaction.  Our purchase orders are based on our
        current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time
        horizons.  We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of
        raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices
        that
        exceed our expected requirements for three months.  We also enter into
        contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these
        contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses
        allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.


The
        expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated
        based
        on current information.  Timing of payments and actual amounts paid
        may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or
        changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Off-Balance
        Sheet Arrangements

As
        of
        March 31, 2007, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements,
        as
        defined in Item 3(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Recently
        Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
        June
        2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial
        Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
        which
        clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
        enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,
        Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition
        threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
        and
        measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
        FIN
        48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are
        reviewing our tax positions taken to determine the effect, if any, that the
        adoption of this Interpretation will have on our results of operations or
        financial condition.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS
        No.
        157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
        fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures
        about fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value
        measurement. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November
        15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process
        of
        determining the effect, if any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have
        on
        our consolidated financial statements. Because Statement No. 157 does not
        require any new fair value measurements or re-measurements of previously
        computed fair values, we do not believe the adoption of this Statement will
        have
        a material effect on our results of operations or financial
        condition.

On
        February 15, 2007, the FASB
        issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
        Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). Under this Standard, we may elect to report
        financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a
        contract-by-contract basis with changes in value reported in earnings. This
        election is irrevocable. SFAS No. 159 provides an opportunity to mitigate
        volatility in reported earnings that is caused by measuring hedged assets
        and
        liabilities that were previously required to use a different accounting method
        than the related hedging contracts when the complex provisions of SFAS No.
        hedge accounting are not met. SFAS No. 159 is effective for years beginning
        after November 15, 2007. Early adoption within 120 days of the beginning
        of our
        2008 fiscal year is permissible, provided we have not yet issued interim
        financial statement for 2008 and have adopted SFAS No. 157. We are currently
        evaluating the potential impact of adopting this Standard.

Item

7A.                      QUANTITATIVE
        AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our
        investment portfolio, consisting of fixed income securities and money market
        funds that we hold on an available-for-sale basis, was $1,278.4 million as
        of March 31, 2007, and $1,285.1 million as of March 31, 2006.  These
        securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate
        risk
        and will decline in value if market interest rates increase.  We have
        the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and, therefore,
        we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or
        cash
        flows if market interest rates increase.  The following table provides
        information about our available-for-sale securities that are sensitive to
        changes in interest rates.  We have aggregated our available-for-sale
        securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature

We
        have
        international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate
        fluctuations.  To date, our exposure related to exchange rate
        volatility has not been significant.  Approximately 99% of our sales
        are denominated in U.S. dollars.  We maintain hedges related to our
        foreign currency exposure of our net investment in a foreign operation as
        needed.  There were no hedges outstanding as of March 31, 2007 or
        March 31, 2005.  The amount of the hedges outstanding as of March 31,
        2006 was immaterial.  If foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15% from
        the rates at March 31, 2007 and 2006, the effect on our financial position
        and
        results of operation would be immaterial.


During
        the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of
        market
        risks, examples of which include, but are not limited to, interest rate
        movements and foreign currency fluctuations, as we discuss in this Item 7A,
        and
        collectability of accounts receivable.  We continuously assess these
        risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the
        adverse effects of these and other potential exposures.  Although we
        do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas, no assurance can
        be
        made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the
        future.

Evaluation
        of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As
        of the
        end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as required
        by
        paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange
        Act of
        1934, as amended, we evaluated under the supervision of our Chief Executive
        Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
        controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on this evaluation, our
        Chief Executive Officer

and
        our
        Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
        procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose
        in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
        (i)
        is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
        specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii)
        is
        accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive

Officer
        and our Chief Financial
        Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
        Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
        assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
        management. Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of
        our
        internal control over financial reporting. Management’s assessment of the
        effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed
        at
        the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no matter how
        well
        designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance
        that the control system’s objectives will be met.

Management
        Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
        management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
        control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding
        the
        reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
        statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting
        includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
        of
        records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
        and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
        that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
        statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
        that
        receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
        with
        authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
        reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
        acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
        material effect on our financial statements.

Management
        assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007,
        the
        end of our fiscal year.  Management based its assessment on criteria
        established in Internal Control

–

Integrated Framework issued by the
        Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
        Commission.  Management’s assessment included evaluation of such
        elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting
        controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control
        environment.  This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring
        performed by our finance organization.

Based
        on
        our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over
        financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide
        reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
        the
        preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
        accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  We reviewed
        the results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of
        Directors.


Our
        independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, who also
        audited our consolidated financial statements, audited management’s assessment
        and independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
        financial reporting.  Ernst & Young LLP has issued their
        attestation report, which is included in Part II, Item 9A of this Form
        10-K.

Changes
        in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

During
        the three months ended March 31, 2007, there was no change in our internal
        control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
        required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that has materially
        affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
        over financial reporting.

REPORT
        OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
        Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Microchip
        Technology Incorporated and subsidiaries

We
        have
        audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report
        on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Microchip Technology
        Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
        financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
        Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
        Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Microchip
        Technology Incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
        internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
        effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
        is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
        effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
        on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management’s assessment that Microchip Technology Incorporated
        maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March
        31,
        2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
        Also, in our opinion, Microchip Technology Incorporated maintained, in all
        material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
        of
        March 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria

.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the March 31, 2007 consolidated financial
        statements of Microchip Technology Incorporated and our report dated May
        23,
        2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT
        OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
        FIRM

The
        Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Microchip
        Technology Incorporated and subsidiaries

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microchip Technology
        Incorporated and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
        consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
        of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2007. These financial
        statements are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our
        responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
        on
        our audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
        fairly,
        in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Microchip
        Technology Incorporated and subsidiaries at March 31, 2007 and 2006, and
        the
        consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
        the
        three years in the period ended March 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
        generally accepted accounting principles.

As
        discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Microchip
        Technology Incorporated changed its method of accounting for Share-Based
        Payments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
        (revised 2004) on April 1, 2006.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Microchip Technology
        Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007,
        based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
        the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
        our
        report dated May 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES

TO
        CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SIGNIFICANT
                  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature
        of Business

Microchip
        develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products used by its
        customers for a wide variety of embedded control
        applications.  Microchip’s product portfolio comprises 8- and 16-bit
        PIC® microcontrollers and 16-bit dsPIC® digital signal controllers, which
        feature on-board Flash (reprogrammable) memory technology.  In
        addition, Microchip offers a broad spectrum of high-performance linear,
        mixed-signal, power management, thermal management, battery management and
        interface devices.  Microchip also makes serial EEPROMs.

Principles
        of Consolidation

The
        consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microchip Technology
        Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Microchip” or the
“Company”).  The Company does not have any subsidiaries in which it
        does not own 100% of the outstanding stock.  All of the Company’s
        subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
        statements.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
        have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue
        Recognition

The
        Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced
        by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title as well as fixed pricing
        and probable collectability.  The Company recognizes revenue from
        product sales to OEMs upon shipment and records reserves for estimated customer
        returns.  Distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection
        and product return rights, so the Company defers revenue recognition until
        the
        distributor sells the product to their customer.  The Company reduces
        product pricing through price protection based on market conditions, competitive
        considerations and other factors.  Price protection is granted to
        distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price
        protection is offered.  When the Company reduces the price of its
        products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding
        accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has
        on
        hand as of the date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue
        impact from the price protection.  The Company also grants certain
        credits to its distributors on specially identified pieces of the distributors’
business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of
        the
        Company’s products to their end customers.  The credits are on a per
        unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information
        regarding the sale to their end customer.  The effect of granting
        these credits establishes the net selling price from the Company to its
        distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by
        the
        Company when the product is sold by the distributors to their end
        customers.  Upon shipment, amounts billed to distributors are included
        as accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, the sale and the gross margin
        are
        deferred and reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by
        the
        distributor to its customers.  Shipping charges billed to customers
        are included in net sales, and the related shipping costs are included in
        cost
        of sales.

Product
        Warranty

The
        Company generally sells products with a limited warranty related to product
        quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property
        infringement claims related to the Company’s products.  Due to
        comprehensive product testing, the short time between product shipment and
        the
        detection and correction of product failures, and a low historical rate of
        payments on indemnification claims, the accrual based on historical activity
        and
        the related expense were immaterial significant as of and for the fiscal
        years
        presented.

Advertising
        Costs

The
        Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred.  Advertising costs
        were immaterial for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

F-6

Research
        and Development

Research
        and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Research and
        development expenses include expenditures for labor, depreciation, masks,
        prototype wafers, and expenses for development of process technologies, new
        packages, and software to support new products and design
        environments.

Foreign
        Currency Translation and Forward Contracts

The
        Company’s foreign subsidiaries are considered to be extensions of the U.S.
        Company and any translation gains and losses related to these subsidiaries
        are
        included in other income and expense.  As the U.S. dollar is utilized
        as the functional currency, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
        transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the
        subsidiaries’ functional currency) are also included in income.  Gains
        and losses associated with currency rate changes on forward contracts are
        recorded currently in income.  These gains and losses are immaterial
        to the Company’s financial statements.

Income
        Taxes

As
        part
        of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company
        is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
        which
        it operates.  This process involves estimating the Company’s actual
        current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting
        from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting
        purposes.  These differences result in deferred tax assets and
        liabilities, which are included within the Company’s consolidated balance
        sheet.  The Company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred
        tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent
        it
        believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation
        allowance.  The Company has not provided for a valuation allowance
        because management currently believes that it is “more likely than not” that its
        deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income.

Cash
        and Cash Equivalents

All
        highly liquid investments, including marketable securities purchased with
        a
        remaining maturity of three months or less when acquired are considered to
        be
        cash equivalents.

Short-term
        and Long-term Investments

The
        Company’s investments are classified as available-for-sale.  These
        investments consist of government agency bonds, municipal bonds, state student
        loan bonds and floating rate securities.  The Company defines
        short-term investments as income yielding securities which can be readily
        converted to cash and defines long-term investments as income yielding
        securities with maturities of over one year that have unrealized losses
        attributable to them. The Company has the ability to hold its long-term
        investments until such time as these assets are no longer
        impaired.  Such recovery is not expected to occur within the next
        year.  The Company’s investments are carried at fair value with
        unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity. Premiums and
        discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related
        available-for-sale security.  Dividend and interest income are
        recognized when earned.  The cost of securities sold is calculated
        using the specific identification method.

Allowance
        for Doubtful Accounts

The
        Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
        resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments,
        which
        is included in bad debt expense.  The Company determines the adequacy
        of this allowance by regularly reviewing the composition of its accounts
        receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables, considering
        such customer’s financial condition, credit history and current economic
        conditions.

Inventories

Inventories
        are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out
        method.  The Company writes down its inventory for estimated
        obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference
        between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon
        assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  If actual
        market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the Company,
        additional inventory write-downs may be required.  Inventory
        impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are
        not
        subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that
        increased carrying amounts

F-7

are
        recoverable.  In estimating reserves for obsolescence, the Company
        primarily evaluates estimates of demand over a 12-month period and provides
        reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month
        demand.

Property,
        Plant and Equipment

Property,
        plant and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are
        capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when
        incurred.  The Company’s property and equipment accounting policies
        incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives
        of
        its property and equipment.  Depreciation is provided for assets
        placed in service on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
        of
        the relative assets, which range from 3 to 30 years.  The Company
        evaluates the carrying value of its property and equipment when events or
        changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets
        may be
        impaired.  Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly
        subjective.

Litigation

The
        Company’s estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on
        claims for which management believes a loss is probable and it can estimate
        the
        amount or range of loss.  Because of the uncertainties related to both
        the amount and range of the loss on the pending litigation, the Company is
        unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from
        an
        unfavorable outcome.  As additional information becomes available, the
        Company will assess the potential liability related to its pending litigation
        and revise its estimates, if necessary.

Goodwill

Goodwill
        is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the
        estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets
        acquired.  The Company is required to perform an annual impairment
        review, and more frequently under certain circumstances. The goodwill is
        subjected to this test during the fourth quarter of the Company’s fiscal
        year.  The Company engages primarily in the design, development,
        manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products and, as a result, the
        Company concluded there is one reporting unit.  The impairment review
        process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying
        value.  If the Company determines through the impairment process that
        goodwill has been impaired, the Company will record the impairment charge
        in the
        statement of income.  As of March 31, 2007, there was no impairment
        charge related to goodwill.

Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets

The
        Company assesses whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are
        present.  If such indicators are present, the Company determines
        whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to
        the
        assets in question is less than their carrying value.  If less, the
        Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying
        amount
        of the assets over their respective fair values.  Fair value is
        determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other
        methods.  If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and
        used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss through a charge to operating
        results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows
        attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying
        value.  The Company would depreciate the remaining value over the
        remaining estimated useful life of the asset.

Share-Based
        Compensation

The
        Company has equity incentive plans under which non-qualified stock options
        and
        restricted stock units (RSUs) have been granted to employees and under which
        non-qualified stock options have been granted to non-employee members of
        the
        Board of Directors.  In the second half of fiscal 2006, the Company
        adopted RSUs as its primary equity incentive compensation instrument for
        employees.  The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan for
        all eligible employees.  Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted
        FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R (revised
        2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS No. 123R).  SFAS No. 123R requires all
        share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
        RSUs, and employee stock purchase rights, to be recognized in the financial
        statements based on their respective grant date fair values and does not
        allow
        the previously permitted pro forma disclosure-only method as an alternative
        to
        financial statement recognition.  SFAS No. 123R supersedes
        Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for
        Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25) and related
        interpretations, and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of
        Cash Flows.

SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits
        of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as
        a
        financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required
        under

F-8

previous
        literature.  This requirement has reduced the Company’s net operating
        cash flows and increased net financing cash flows.  In March 2005, the
        SEC issued SAB No. 107,

Share-Based
        Payment

(SAB 107), which provides guidance regarding the
        interaction of SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and
        regulations.  The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 107
        in its adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

The
        Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified-prospective method of
        recognition of compensation expense related to share-based payments. The
        Company’s consolidated statement of income for the twelve months ended March 31,
        2007 reflects the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R.  In
        accordance with the modified-prospective transition method, the Company’s
        consolidated statements of income for prior periods have not been restated
        to
        reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R.

SFAS No. 123R
        requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards
        on
        the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion
        of the
        award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably
        over
        the requisite service periods.  The Company has estimated the fair
        value of each award as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
        pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded
        options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely
        transferable.  The Black-Scholes model considers, among other factors,
        the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of the Company’s
        stock price.  Although the Black-Scholes model meets the requirements
        of SFAS No. 123R and SAB 107, the fair values generated by the
        model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of the Company’s awards as
        it does not consider other factors important to those share-based payment
        awards
        such as, continued employment, periodic vesting requirements, and limited
        transferability.

Prior
        to
        the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company presented all tax benefits of
        deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash
        flows
        in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.  SFAS No. 123R
        requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits arising from tax
        deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for the equity
        incentives (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash
        flows.  The $22.8 million excess tax benefit classified as a financing
        cash inflow in the Company’s accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows
        for the twelve months ending March 31, 2007 would have been classified as
        an
        operating cash inflow if the Company had not adopted SFAS No. 123R.

Prior
        to
        the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company accounted for share-based payment
        awards to employees in accordance with APB 25 and related interpretations,
        and had adopted the disclosure-only alternative of
        SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
        Compensation  (“SFAS 123”), and
        SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based
        Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.  In accordance
        with APB 25, share-based compensation expense was not recorded in
        connection with share-based payment awards granted with exercise prices equal
        to
        or greater than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date
        of grant, unless certain modifications were subsequently made.  The
        Company recorded deferred compensation in connection with RSUs equal to the
        fair
        market value of the common stock on the date of grant.  Recorded
        deferred compensation was recognized as share-based compensation expense
        ratably
        over the applicable vesting periods.  In accordance with the
        provisions of SFAS No. 123R, all deferred compensation previously recorded
        has
        been eliminated with a corresponding reduction in additional paid-in
        capital.

Determining
        the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of share-based
        awards at the date of grant requires judgment.  The fair value of RSUs
        is based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
        grant discounted for expected future dividends.  The Company uses the
        Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee
        stock
        options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans,
        consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R.  Option pricing
        models, including the Black-Scholes model, also require the use of input
        assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, expected dividend
        rate, and expected risk-free rate of return.  The Company uses a blend
        of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the
        open
        market as it believes this is more reflective of market conditions and a
        better
        indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical
        volatility.  The expected life of the awards is based on historical
        and other economic data trended into the future.  The risk-free
        interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate
        for the
        terms of the Company’s awards.  The dividend yield assumption is based
        on the Company’s history and expectation of future dividend
        payouts.  SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to develop an estimate of
        the number of share-based awards which will be forfeited due to employee
        turnover.  Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have
        a significant effect on share-based compensation, as the effect of adjusting
        the
        rate for all expense amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the
        period the forfeiture estimate is changed.  If the actual forfeiture
        rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is
        made to
        increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to
        the
        expense recognized in the

F-9

financial
        statements.  If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated
        forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture
        rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the
        financial statements.  If forfeiture adjustments are made, they would
        affect the Company’s results of operations.  The effect of forfeiture
        adjustments in the year ended March 31, 2007 was immaterial.

The
        Company evaluates the assumptions used to value its awards on a quarterly
        basis.  If factors change and the Company employs different
        assumptions, share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from
        what
        was recorded in the past.  If there are any modifications or
        cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, the Company may be required
        to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based
        compensation expense.  Future share-based compensation expense and
        unearned share-based compensation will increase to the extent that the Company
        grants additional equity awards to employees or it assumes unvested equity
        awards in connection with acquisitions.  Had the Company adopted SFAS
        No. 123R in prior periods, the magnitude of the impact of that standard on
        its
        results of operations would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123
        assuming the application of the Black-Scholes option pricing model as described
        in the disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share
        in
        Note 14 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Concentrations
        of Credit Risk

Financial
        instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
        risk consist primarily of investments in debt securities and trade
        receivables.  The Company generally places its investments with
        high-credit

quality
        counterparties.  Investments in debt securities with original
        maturities of greater than six months consist primarily of AAA rated financial
        instruments and counterparties.  The Company’s investments are
        primarily in direct obligations of the United States government or its
        agencies.

Concentrations
        of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally not significant
        due to the diversity of the Company’s customers and geographic sales
        areas.  The Company had two distributors that accounted for 10% or
        more of its net sales in the year ended March 31, 2007.  The Company
        sells its products primarily to OEMs and distributors in the Americas, Europe
        and Asia.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
        customers’ financial condition and requires collateral, primarily letters of
        credit, as deemed necessary.  No single end customer accounted for 10%
        or more of the Company’s net sales or accounts receivable balances during the
        years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.  See Note 16, Geographic
        Information, for additional information on the Company’s largest
        distributors.

Use
        of Estimates

The
        Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting
        of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent
        assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements in
        conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Actual
        results could differ from those estimates.

Recently
        Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
        June
        2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial
        Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
        Taxes

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
        recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB
        Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The interpretation
        prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
        statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
        to be
        taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
        December 15, 2006. The Company is reviewing its tax positions taken to determine
        the effect, if any, that the adoption of this Interpretation will have on
        its
        results of operations or financial condition.  However, the Company
        does not expect the adoption of this Interpretation to have a material effect
        on
        the Company’s results of operations or financial conditions.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurement

(SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
        framework
        for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
        principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements, but does
        not
        require any new fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
        years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those
        fiscal
        years. The Company is in the process of determining the effect, if any, that
        the
        adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
        Because Statement No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements
        or
        re-measurements of previously computed fair values, management does not believe

F-10

the adoption of this Statement will have a material effect on the Company's
          results of operations or financial condition.

On
        February 15, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
        Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(SFAS No. 159). Under this
        Standard, the Company may elect to report financial instruments and certain
        other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in
        value
        reported in earnings. This election is irrevocable. SFAS No. 159 provides
        an
        opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings that is caused by
        measuring hedged assets and liabilities that were previously required to
        use a
        different accounting method than the related hedging contracts when the complex
        provisions of SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting are not met. SFAS No. 159 is
        effective for years beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption within
        days of the beginning of the Company’s 2008 fiscal year is permissible, provided
        the Company has not yet issued interim financial statements for 2008 and
        has
        adopted SFAS No. 157. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
        of adopting this Standard.

SPECIAL
                  CHARGES

Settlement
        with U.S. Philips Corporation

In
        fiscal
        2005, the Company reached an agreement with U.S. Philips Corporation and
        Philips
        Electronics North America Corp. (together “Philips”) regarding patent license
        litigation.  The agreement included dismissal of the then pending
        litigation and the cross-license of certain patents between Philips and the
        Company.  The Company recorded a special charge of $21.1 million in
        the quarter that ended June 30, 2004 associated with this
        matter.  Pursuant to this cross-license, the Company licensed certain
        of its patents related to 8-pin microcontrollers to Philips, and Philips
        licensed its patents related to I


C serial
        communications to the Company, each on fully-paid up, non-royalty bearing
        worldwide licenses.  The Company finalized and executed the definitive
        settlement agreement related to this matter and made the cash payment to
        Philips
        during the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2004.

There
        were no special charges in fiscal 2006 or 2007.

INVESTMENTS

The
        Company’s investments are intended to establish a high-quality portfolio that
        preserves principal, meets liquidity needs, avoids inappropriate concentrations
        and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to the Company’s investment
        guidelines and market conditions.  The following is a summary of
        available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2007 (amounts in
        thousands):

At
        March
        31, 2007, the Company evaluated its investment portfolio, and noted unrealized
        losses of $8.8 million were due to fluctuations in interest
        rates.  Management does not believe any of the unrealized losses
        represented an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of
        available evidence as of March 31, 2007.  The Company’s intent is to
        hold these investments to such time as these assets are no longer
        impaired.  For those investments not scheduled to mature until after
        March 31, 2008, such recovery is not anticipated to occur in the next year
        and
        these investments have been classified as long-term investments.  At
        March 31, 2007, short-term investments consist of $583.0 million and long-term
        investments consist of $527.9 million.

The
        amortized cost and estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities
        at
        March 31, 2007, by maturity, are shown below (amounts in
        thousands).  Expected maturities can differ from contractual
        maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay
        obligations without prepayment penalties, and the Company views its
        available-for-sale securities as available for current
        operations.

SHORT-TERM
        DEBT

The
        Company had no short-term debt at March 31, 2007.  The Company had
        short-term debt of $269.0 million at March 31, 2006. The short-term debt
        was a
        result of repurchase agreements that were in place with two investment
        brokerages. The short-term debt was collateralized with $277.6 million of
        available-for-sale investments at March 31, 2006 and had a weighted average
        interest rate of 4.83%.  In fiscal 2006, the borrowings were made to
        complete a $500 million repatriation of foreign earnings under the American
        Jobs
        Creation Act. The borrowings were collateralized against investments that
        are held by the Company’s offshore subsidiaries.  During fiscal 2007,
        the entire $269.0 million of short-term borrowings were paid
        down.  There were no covenants associated with the repurchase
        agreements.

INCOME
        TAXES

The
                  provision for income taxes consists of the following (amounts in
                  thousands):

The
        tax
        benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes
        currently payable by $22.9 million, $29.4 million and $15.3 million
        for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.  These amounts were credited to additional paid-in
        capital in each of the three fiscal years.

The
        provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the
        statutory federal tax rate to income before income taxes.  The sources
        and tax effects of the differences in the total income tax provision are
        as
        follows (amounts in thousands):

Pretax
        income from foreign operations was $255.3 million, $257.8 million and
        $199.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.  Unremitted foreign earnings that are considered to be
        permanently invested outside the United States, and on which no deferred
        taxes
        have been provided, amounted to approximately $708.7 million at March 31,
        2007.  Should the Company elect in the future to repatriate a portion
        of the foreign earnings so invested, the Company would incur income tax expense
        on such repatriation, net of any

available
        deductions and foreign tax credits.  This would result in additional
        income tax expense beyond the computed expected provision in such
        periods.

F-14

During
        year ended March 31, 2007, the Company completed a settlement agreement with
        the
        United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for its fiscal years ended March
        31, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.  As part of this settlement the Company
        recognized $52.2 million as a tax benefit in March 2007 related to amounts
        previously accrued for the issues that were in dispute with the
        IRS.  This tax benefit decreased the Company’s effective tax rate for
        fiscal 2007 by approximately 13.0 percentage points, to 11.0%.  This
        decrease is reflected as a separate line in the rate reconciliation table
        above.

The
        American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”) created a temporary
        incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad
        by providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain dividends from
        controlled non-U.S. corporations.  During fiscal 2006, the Company’s
        Chief Executive Officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan, under which
        the
        Company repatriated $500 million in earnings outside the U.S. pursuant to
        the Jobs Act.  The Company recorded additional tax expense in fiscal
        2006 of approximately $30.6 million ($0.14 per diluted common share)
        related to this decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings.  This
        repatriation increased the Company’s effective rate for fiscal 2006 by
        approximately 8.5 percentage points, to 32.5%.  This increase is
        reflected as a separate line item in the rate reconciliation table
        above.

The
        tax
        effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
        the
        deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (amounts
        in
        thousands):

Management
        believes that the Company’s results of future operations will generate
        sufficient taxable income such that it is “more likely than not” that the
        deferred tax assets will be realized.

At
        March
        31, 2007, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income
        tax purposes of approximately $10.1 million, which begins to expire in
        varying amounts in the years 2020

through
        2022.  The net operating loss carryforward is attributable to the
        acquisition of PowerSmart in fiscal 2003.  An analysis of the annual
        limitation on the utilization of the PowerSmart net operating losses was
        performed in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 382.  It
        was determined that Section 382 will not limit the use of the PowerSmart
        net
        operating losses in full over the carryover period.

At
        March
        31, 2007, the Company had recorded credit carryforwards of approximately
        $6.8 million for foreign tax credits.  The foreign tax credits
        begin to expire in varying amounts in the years ending March 31, 2014 through
        March 31, 2017.  The Company believes that all of its credit
        carryforwards will be utilized in future periods.

The
        Company’s Thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax
        holidays granted to the Company based on its investment in property, plant
        and
        equipment in Thailand.  The Company’s tax holiday periods in Thailand
        expire at various times in the future.  The Company does not expect
        the future expiration of any of its tax holiday periods in Thailand to have
        a
        material impact on its effective tax rate.  The aggregate dollar
        benefits

F-15

derived
        from these tax holidays approximated $6.1 million, $7.9 million and
        $11.5 million for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.  The benefit the tax holiday had on net income per share
        approximated $0.03, $0.04 and $0.05 for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006
        and
        2005, respectively.

The
        Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United
        States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and
        the
        extent to which, additional tax payments are probable.  The Company
        believes that it maintains adequate tax reserves to offset any potential
        tax
        liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of matters for open tax
        years.  The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s fiscal years ended
        March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  The Company believes that it maintains
        adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise
        upon these and other pending audits in the United States and other countries
        in
        which it does business.  If such amounts ultimately prove to be
        unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax
        benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
        necessary.  If such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an
        ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would be recorded in the
        period
        in which the assessment is determined.

11.

CONTINGENCIES

The
        Company’s assembly and test facility in Thailand is located in Alphatechnopolis
        Industrial Park near Bangkok on land to which the Company expects to acquire
        title in accordance with its agreement with the landowner.  Progress
        towards obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due to a bankruptcy
        relating to the seller of the land.  The Company is currently working
        with the creditors in an attempt to reach resolution on this
        matter.  At this time it is not possible to estimate when, or if,
        transfer of full title will be completed.  The Company has provided
        reserves that it estimates will be adequate to obtain full
        title.  Such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the
        land.

In
        the
        ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in a limited number
        of
        legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured
        liability in any one or more of them.  Litigation relating to the
        semiconductor industry is not uncommon, and the Company is, and from time
        to
        time has been, subject to such litigation.  In the Company’s opinion,
        based on consultation with legal counsel, as of March 31, 2007, the effect
        of
        such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
        position, cash flows or results of operations.

STOCKHOLDERS’
                  EQUITY

Stockholder
        Rights Plan.

Effective October 11, 1999, the Company adopted an
        Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement as amended on January
        29,
        2007 (the “Amended Rights Agreement”).  The Amended Rights Agreement
        amends and restates the Preferred Share Rights Agreement adopted by the Company
        as of February 13, 1995 (the “Prior Rights Agreement”).  Under the
        Prior Rights Agreement, on February 13, 1995, the Company’s Board of Directors
        declared a dividend of one right (a “Right”) to purchase one one-hundredth of a
        share of the Company’s Series A Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A
        Preferred”) for each outstanding share of common stock, $.001 par value, of the
        Company.  The dividend was payable on February 24, 1995 to
        stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date.  The
        Amended Rights Agreement supersedes the Prior Rights Agreement as originally
        executed.  Under the Amended Rights Agreement, each Right enables the
        holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series
        A
        Preferred at a purchase price of seventy four dollars and seven cents ($74.07)
        (the “Purchase Price”), subject to adjustment.  Under the Amended
        Rights Agreement, the rights will become exercisable upon the earlier of
        (i) 10
        days following a public announcement that a person or a group of affiliated
        or
        associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial
        ownership of 18% or more of the Company’s outstanding common shares, or (ii) 10
        days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company’s Board
        of Directors) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention
        to
        make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result
        in
        a beneficial ownership by a person or group of 18% or more of the Company’s
        outstanding common shares.

Stock
        Repurchase Activity.

On April 22, 2004, the Company’s Board of
        Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of
        its
        common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated
        transactions.  As of March 31, 2007, the Company had repurchased
        1,004,834 shares under this authorization for $26.6 million.  As of
        March 31, 2007, all of the purchased shares under the authorizations had
        been
        reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under the Company’s
        employee stock purchase plan.  On October 25, 2006, the Company
        announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up
        to an
        additional 10 million shares of its common stock in the open market or in
        privately negotiated transactions.  The timing and amount of
        future

F-16

repurchases
        will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate
        considerations.  During the year ended March 31, 2007, the Company did
        not repurchase any of its shares of common stock.  During the year
        ended March 31, 2006, the Company purchased 119,934 shares of its common
        stock for $3.3 million.  During the year ended March 31, 2005, the
        Company purchased 2,184,800 shares of its common stock for
        $57.7

million.

EMPLOYEE
                  BENEFIT PLANS

The
        Company maintains a contributory profit-sharing plan for its domestic employees
        meeting certain eligibility and service requirements.  The plan
        qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
        and allows employees to contribute up to 60% of their base salary, subject
        to
        maximum annual limitations prescribed by the Internal Revenue
        Service.  The Company shall make a matching contribution of up to 25%
        of the first 4% of the participant’s eligible compensation and may award up to
        an additional 25% under the discretionary match.  All matches are
        provided on a quarterly basis and require the participant to be an active
        employee at the end of each quarter.  For the fiscal years ended March
        31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company contributions to the plan totaled
        $1.7

million, $1.5 million and $1.4 million,
        respectively.

The
        Company’s 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2001 Purchase Plan”) became
        effective on March 1, 2002.  The Board of Directors approved the 2001
        Purchase Plan in May 2001 and the stockholders approved it in August
        2001.  Under the 2001 Purchase Plan, eligible employees of the Company
        may purchase shares of common stock at semi-annual intervals through periodic
        payroll deductions.  The purchase price in general will be 85% of the
        lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the
        participant’s entry date into the offering period or 85% of the fair market
        value on the semi-annual purchase date.  Depending upon a
        participant’s entry date into the 2001 Purchase Plan, purchase periods under the
        2001 Purchase Plan consist of overlapping periods of either 24, 18, 12 or
        months in duration.  In May 2003 and August 2003, the Company’s Board
        and stockholders, respectively, each approved an annual automatic increase
        in
        the number of shares reserved under the 2001 Purchase Plan.  The
        automatic increase took effect on January 1, 2005, and on each January 1
        thereafter during the term of the plan, and is equal to the lesser of (i)
        1,500,000 shares, (ii) one half of one percent (0.5%) of the then outstanding
        shares of the Company’s common stock, or (iii) such lesser amount as is approved
        by the Company’s Board of Directors.  On January 1, 2007, 1,080,191
        additional shares were reserved under the 2001 Purchase Plan based on the
        automatic increase.  On January 1, 2006, 1,058,541 additional shares
        were reserved under the 2001 Purchase Plan based on the automatic
        increase.  On January 1, 2005, 1,035,863 additional shares were
        reserved under the 2001 Purchase Plan based on the automatic
        increase.  Since the inception of the 2001 Purchase Plan, 6,599,595
        shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance and 2,132,832 shares
        have
        been issued under this purchase plan.

During
        fiscal 1995, a purchase plan was adopted for employees in non-U.S.
        locations.  Such plan allows for the purchase price per share to be
        100% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning
        or end of the semi-annual purchase plan period.  Effective May 1,
        2006, the Company’s Board approved a purchase price per share equal to
        eighty-five percent (85%) of the lower of the fair market value of the common
        stock at the beginning or end of the semi-annual purchase plan
        period.  Since the inception of this purchase plan, 564,632 shares of
        common stock have been reserved for issuance and 271,512 shares have been
        issued
        under this purchase plan.

Effective
        January 1, 1997, the Company adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation
        arrangement.  This plan is unfunded and is maintained primarily for
        the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of highly
        compensated employees as defined in ERISA Sections 201, 301 and
        401.  There are no Company matching contributions made under this
        plan.

The
        Company has management incentive compensation plans which provides for bonus
        payments, based on a percentage of base salary, from an incentive pool created
        from operating profits of the Company, at the discretion of the Board of
        Directors.  During the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        $12.4 million, $14.1 million and $10.2 million were charged against
        operations for this plan, respectively.

The
        Company also has a plan that, at the discretion of the Board of Directors,
        provides a cash bonus to all employees of the Company based on the operating
        profits of the Company.  During the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006
        and 2005, $6.2 million, $9.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, were
        charged against operations for this plan.

EQUITY
                  INCENTIVE PLANS

The
        Company has equity incentive plans under which incentive stock options,
        restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and non-qualified stock options have been
        granted to employees and under which non-qualified stock options have been
        granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors.  The
        Company’s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “2004 Plan”),
        is shareholder approved and permits the grant of stock options and RSUs to
        employees, non-employee members of the Board of Directors and
        consultants.  At March 31, 2007, 12.1 million shares remained
        available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.  Stock options and
        RSUs are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to
        the
        Company and to provide incentive for them to remain employed with the
        Company.  The Company believes that such awards better align the
        interests of its employees with those of its shareholders.

The
        Board
        of Directors or the plan administrator determines eligibility, vesting schedules
        and exercise prices for equity incentives granted under the
        plans.  Stock options granted generally have a term of 10 years. 
Equity incentives granted in the case of newly hired employees generally
        vest
        and become exercisable at the rate of 25% after one year of service and ratably
        on a monthly or quarterly basis over a period of 36 months
        thereafter.  Subsequent equity incentive grants to existing employees
        generally vest and become exercisable ratably on a monthly or quarterly basis
        over a period starting in 48 months and ending in 60 months after the date
        of
        grant.  Historically, the Company has gone through its equity
        compensation grant process during the first two weeks of April each
        year.

Under
        the
        plans, 105,929,741 shares of common stock had been reserved for issuance
        since
        the inception of the plans.

Share-Based
        Compensation Expense

The
        following table presents details of share-based compensation expense resulting
        from the application of SFAS NO. 123R (amounts in thousands):

(1)
        The
        amounts included in the twelve months ended March 31, 2007 reflect the adoption
        of SFAS No. 123R.  In accordance with the modified prospective method
        of transition, the Company’s consolidated statements of income for prior periods
        have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS
        No.
        123R.

(2)
        During the twelve months ended March 31, 2007,
        $6.6

million was capitalized to inventory, of which $3.3
        million was sold.

The
        amount of unearned share-based compensation currently estimated to be expensed
        in fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012 related to unvested share-based payment
        awards at March 31, 2007 is $65.7 million.  The weighted average
        period over which the unearned share-based compensation is expected to be
        recognized is approximately 2.72 years.

In
        accordance with the requirements of the disclosure-only alternative of SFAS
        No.
        123, set forth below is a pro forma illustration of the effect on net income
        and
        net income per share computed as if the Company had valued share-based awards
        to
        employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model instead of applying
        the
        guidelines provided by APB 25 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and
        (in thousands, except per share amounts):

F-18

At
        a
        meeting held on February 17, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board
        of
        Directors and the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration
        of
        the vesting of certain Company stock options with an option price of $27.153
        per
        share or greater.  The purpose of the accelerated vesting was to
        enable the Company to avoid recognizing in its income statement compensation
        expense associated with these options in future periods, upon adoption of
        SFAS
        No. 123R on April 1, 2006.  The pre-tax charge that was avoided
        amounted to approximately $13.7 million and represented the fair value of
        the
        unvested awards as of the date of the acceleration as determined under SFAS
        No.
        123.  This amount would otherwise have been required to be recognized
        as compensation expense over the vesting period upon adoption of SFAS No.
        123R.  As a result of the accelerated vesting, approximately 2.3
        million option shares or 25.4% of the total number of the outstanding unvested
        option shares as of the date of the acceleration with varying remaining vesting
        schedules became immediately exercisable.  In connection with the
        vesting acceleration, the Company required that any shares received through
        the
        exercise of the accelerated options not be sold by the option holder until
        the
        first to occur of the original vesting date of the accelerated option or
        the
        termination of the employment of the option holder.  On April 25,
        2006, in order to alleviate administrative burdens, the Company waived this
        requirement as to approximately 1.0 million option shares held by those
        employees who are not executive officers, appointed officers or director-level
        employees of the Company.  As of the date of the acceleration, the
        fair market value of the Company’s common stock was below the option price of
        the accelerated options in all material respects, so no APB No. 25 charges
        were
        incurred and future potential charges are immaterial.

:

The
        total
        pre-tax intrinsic value of RSUs which vested during the twelve months ended
        March 31, 2007 was $1.4 million.  The aggregate pre-tax intrinsic
        value of RSUs outstanding at March 31, 2007 was $59.8 million calculated
        based
        on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $35.53 on March 30,
        2007.  At March 31, 2007, the weighted average remaining expense
        recognition period was 3.28 years.  The weighted average fair values
        per share of the RSUs awarded in the twelve months ended March 31, 2007 was
        $31.37, calculated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock
        on the respective grant dates discounted for the Company’s

        yield.  The weighted average fair values per share of RSUs awarded in
        the twelve months ended March 31, 2006 was $31.36, calculated based on the
        intrinsic value on the date of grant.

Option
        activity under the Company’s stock incentive plans in the three years ended
        March 31, 2007 is set forth below:

The
        total
        pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the twelve months ended
        March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $61.8 million, $90.3 million
        and $42.4 million, respectively.  This intrinsic value represents
        the difference between the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on
        the date of exercise and the exercise price of each equity award.

The
        following table summarizes information about the stock options outstanding
        at
        March 31, 2007:

The
        aggregate pre-tax intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable
        at March 31, 2007 was $201.2 million and $147.8 million,
        respectively.  The aggregate pre-tax intrinsic values were calculated
        based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $35.53 on March 30,
        2007.

At
        March
        31, 2007 and 2006, the number of option shares exercisable was 9,958,426
        and

GEOGRAPHIC
                  INFORMATION

The
        Company operates in one operating segment and engages primarily in the design,
        development, manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products.  The
        Company sells its products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers
        (OEMs) in a broad range of market segments, performs on-going credit evaluations
        of its customers and generally requires no collateral.  The Company’s
        operations outside the United States consist of product assembly and final
        test
        facilities in Thailand, and sales and support centers and design centers
        in
        certain foreign countries.  Domestic operations are responsible for
        the design, development and wafer fabrication of all products, as well as
        the
        coordination of production planning and shipping to meet worldwide customer
        commitments.  The Thailand assembly and test facility is reimbursed in
        relation to value added with respect to assembly and test operations and
        other
        functions performed, and certain foreign sales offices receive compensation
        for
        sales within their territory.  Accordingly, for financial statement
        purposes, it is not meaningful to segregate sales or operating profits for
        the
        assembly and test and foreign sales office operations.  Identifiable
        long-lived assets (consisting of property, plant and equipment, intangible
        assets and goodwill) by geographic area are as follows (amounts in

Sales
        to
        unaffiliated customers located outside the United States, primarily in Asia
        and
        Europe, aggregated approximately 74%, 74% and 73% of consolidated net sales
        for
        the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Sales to
        customers in Europe represented 29%, 28% and 27% of consolidated net sales
        for
        the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Sales to
        customers in Asia represented 43%, 44% and 43% of consolidated net sales
        for the
        years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Sales into
        China, including Hong Kong, represented 18%, 17% and 16% of consolidated
        net
        sales for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.  Sales into Taiwan represented 10% of consolidated net
        sales for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.  Sales into
        any other individual foreign country did not exceed 10% of the Company’s net
        sales for any of the years presented.

The
        Company had two distributors who represented more than 10% of its net sales
        during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.  The Company’s largest distributor
        accounted for approximately 11% of its net sales and its second largest
        distributor accounted for approximately 10% of net sales in fiscal
        2007.  The Company’s largest distributor accounted for approximately
        13% of its net sales and its second largest distributor accounted for
        approximately 11% of its net sales in fiscal 2006.  The Company’s
        largest distributor accounted for approximately 13% of its net sales and
        its
        second largest distributor accounted for approximately 12% of its net sales
        in
        fiscal 2005.

FAIR
                  VALUE OF FINANCIAL
                  INSTRUMENTS

The
        carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because their
        maturity is less than three months.  The carrying amount of short-term
        and long-term investments approximates fair value as the securities are marked
        to market as of each balance sheet date with any unrealized gains and losses
        reported in stockholders’ equity.  The carrying amount of accounts
        receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value
        due
        to the short-term maturity of the amounts.  The fair value of
        short-term debt and lines of credit approximates their carrying value as
        they
        are estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates currently offered
        to
        the Company for similar debt instruments.

The
        Company has entered into certain financial instruments in the normal course
        of
        business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange
        rates.  These financial instruments include standby letters of credit
        and foreign currency forward contracts.  When engaging in forward
        contracts, risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet
        the
        terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest
        rates
        and foreign exchange rates.  At March 31, 2007, there were no foreign
        currency forward contracts outstanding.  At March 31, 2006, the
        Company held contracts with nominal amounts totaling $1.6 million, which
        were entered into and hedged the Company’s foreign currency risk.  The
        value of the contracts is based on quoted market prices.  The
        contracts matured in April 2006.  Unrealized gains and losses as of
        the balance sheet dates and realized gains and losses for the years ending
        March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were immaterial.
