Industry Background

Competitive pressures
require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product
functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing
cost.  To address these requirements,
manufacturers often use integrated circuit-based embedded control systems that
enable them to:

•

differentiate their products

•

replace less efficient electromechanical
control devices

•

reduce the number of components in
their system

•

add product functionality

•

decrease time to market for their
products, and

•

significantly reduce product cost.


Embedded control systems
have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide
variety of applications and markets worldwide, including:

•

automotive comfort, safety and entertainment
applications

•

remote control devices

•

handheld tools

•

home appliances

•

portable computers

•

robotics

•

cordless and cellular telephone accessories

•

motor controls

•

security systems

•

educational and entertainment devices, and

•

consumer electronics.

Embedded control systems
also facilitate the emergence of new classes of products when applications not
previously existing become possible. 
Embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the
principal active, and sometimes sole, component.  A microcontroller is a self-contained
computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, non-volatile
program memory, random access memory for data storage and various input/output
peripheral capabilities.  In addition to
the microcontroller, a complete embedded control system incorporates application-specific
software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers,
non-volatile memory components such as EEPROMs, and various analog and
interface products.

The increasing demand for
embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the largest
segments of the semiconductor market. 
Microcontrollers are currently available in 4-bit through 32-bit
architectures.  Although 4-bit
microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive, they generally lack the minimum
functionality required in most applications and are typically used in
relatively simple applications.  While
traditional 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers provide very high performance
and functionality, they are generally too expensive for many high-volume
embedded control applications.  As a
result, many manufacturers of competitive, high-volume products have found 8-bit
microcontrollers to be the most cost-effective embedded control solution.

Most microcontrollers
shipped today are ROM-based and must be programmed by the semiconductor
supplier during manufacturing, resulting in 8-12-week lead times, based on
market conditions, for delivery of such microcontrollers.  In
addition to delayed product introduction, these long lead times can result in
potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes
in the firmware are required. To address these issues, some suppliers offer
programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the
customer’s manufacturing line, thus significantly reducing lead-time and
inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur.  While these microcontrollers were initially
expensive relative to ROM-based microcontrollers, manufacturing technology has
evolved over the last several years to the point where reprogrammable
microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over ROM-based
microcontrollers, thus providing significant value to microcontroller
customers.  As a result, reprogrammable
microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller market.

digital
signal controllers

•

high-performance
linear and mixed-signal devices

•

power
management and thermal management devices

•

patented
KEELOQ

®

security ASSPs

We provide highly
cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of
small size, high performance, low voltage/power operation and ease of development,
enabling timely and cost-effective embedded control product integration by our
customers.


Microcontrollers

We offer a broad family
of microcontroller products featuring a unique, proprietary architecture
marketed under the PIC

®

brand name. 
We believe that our PIC product family is a price/performance leader in
the worldwide microcontroller market.  We
have shipped over 3 billion PIC microcontrollers to customers worldwide since
their introduction in 1990.  Our PIC
products are designed for applications requiring field-programmability, high
performance, low power and cost effectiveness. 
They feature a variety of memory technology configurations, low voltage
and power, small footprint and ease of use. 
Our performance results from an exclusive product architecture which
features dual data and instruction pathways, referred to as a Harvard dual-bus
architecture; a Reduced Instruction Set Computer, referred to as RISC; and
variable length instructions; all of which provide significant speed advantages
over alternative single-bus, Complex Instruction Set Computer architectures,
referred to as CISC.  With over 260 microcontrollers in our product
portfolio, we target the entire performance range of 8-bit
microcontrollers.  Additionally, our
scalable product architecture allows us to successfully target both the
entry-level of the 16-bit microcontroller market, as well as the 4-bit
microcontroller marketplace, significantly enlarging our addressable market.

We have used our
manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional
enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production
of our PIC

®

family of microcontroller products.  Our extensive experience base has enabled us
to develop our advanced, low cost user programmability feature by incorporating
non-volatile memory, such as Flash, EEPROM and EPROM Memory, into the
microcontroller, and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product
offerings.

Digital
Signal Controllers

We recently began production shipments of our Digital
Signal Controller product line.  Our
family of dsPIC

®

Digital Signal Controllers, currently 19 products,
integrates control features of high-performance 16-bit microcontrollers with
the processing capabilities of Digital Signal Processors (DSPs).  During the last three fiscal years, all of
our Digital Signal Controller product development has been focused on
reprogrammable (Flash) products.  These
controllers integrate a wide variety of peripheral functions making them
suitable for a large number of embedded control applications.

Our dsPIC product family offers a broad suite of hardware
and software development tools, software application libraries, development
boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application
development cycle.  With its
field-re-programmability, large selection of peripheral functions, small
footprint and ease of use, we believe that our dsPIC controllers will
significantly enlarge our addressable market.

Development
Systems

We offer a comprehensive
set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development tools.  These tools enable system designers to
quickly and easily program a PIC microcontroller and dsPIC Digital Signal
Controllers for specific applications and are a key factor for obtaining design
wins.

Our family of development
tools operates in the standard Windows

®

environment on standard PC
hardware.  These tools range from
entry-level systems, which include an assembler and programmer or in-circuit
debugging hardware, to fully configured systems that provide in-circuit
emulation hardware.  Customers moving
from entry-level designs to those requiring real-time emulation are able to
preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future PIC
devices since all of our systems share the same integrated development
environment.

Many independent
companies also develop and market application development tools and systems
that support our standard microcontroller product architecture.  Currently, there are more than 150
third-party tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary
microcontroller architecture.

We believe that
familiarity with and adoption of our, and third-party, development systems by
an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the
future selection of our embedded control products.  These development tools allow design
engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our
standard microcontrollers.  To date, we
have shipped more than 358,000 development systems.


ASSPs

Our application-specific
standard products, referred to as ASSPs, are specialized products designed to
perform specific end-user applications, compared to our other products that are
more general purpose in nature.  Our ASSP
device families currently include, among others, our KEELOQ

®

family of secure data transmission products and smart battery management
products.

Analog
and Interface Products

Our analog and interface
products now consist of several families with over 420 power management,
linear, mixed-signal, thermal management and interface products.  At the end of fiscal 2005, our mixed-signal
analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 9,500 end
customers.

We continue marketing and
selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller
customer base, which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy, as well as to
new customers.  In addition to our “attach”
strategy, we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional
PIC microcontroller and memory products customer base.  We market these, and all of our products,
based on an application segment approach, targeted to solve different problems
in development of our customers’ products.

Memory
Products

Our memory products
consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only
memory, referred to as EEPROMs.  We sell these devices primarily into the
embedded control market, and we are one of the largest suppliers of such
devices worldwide.  EEPROM products are
used for non-volatile program and data storage in systems where such data must
be either modified frequently or retained for long periods.  Serial EEPROMs have a very low I/O pin
requirement, permitting production of very small devices.

We address customer
requirements by offering products with extremely small package sizes and very
low operating voltages for both read and write functions.  Our memory products also feature long data
retention and high erase/write endurance.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and
assembly and test.  The ownership of our
manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy,
enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us
being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning our wafer fabrication facilities and
much of our assembly and test operations, and by employing proprietary
statistical process control techniques, we have been able to achieve and
maintain high production yields.  Direct
control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and
production cycles.  This control also
allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and
testing profit margin.

Our manufacturing
facilities are located in:

•

Tempe,
Arizona (Fab 2)

•

Chandler,
Arizona (probe operations)

•

Puyallup,
Washington (Fab 3) (non-operational)

•

Gresham,
Oregon (Fab 4), and

•

Bangkok,
Thailand (assembly and test).

Wafer
Fabrication

Fab 2 currently produces 8-inch
wafers and supports manufacturing processes between 0.35 and 5.0 microns.  During fiscal 2005, Fab 2 operated at
approximately 96% of its capacity compared to approximately 91% during fiscal
2004.  Operating at higher percentages of
capacity has a positive impact on our operating results due to the relatively
high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing.


On June 30, 2003, we
completed closure of our Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1) wafer fabrication facility
and integrated certain Fab 1 personnel and processes into our Tempe, Arizona
(Fab 2) wafer fabrication facility.  The
facility where Fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall campus in
Chandler, Arizona.  Within this same
facility resides our wafer probe, mask making and other manufacturing related
activities.  We have no specific plans
for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations, and
intend to leave it in an idle status.

Fab 3 is currently
non-operational and being held for future use. 
See “

Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Special Charges – Fab 3
Impairment Charge

,” below at page 33, for a discussion of the
status of Fab 3.

Fab 4 was acquired by us
in August 2002 and began production on October 31, 2003.  Fab 4 produces 8-inch wafers using 0.5 micron
manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 0.18
microns.  Fab 4 has reached a level of
production where costs and efficiencies have met our initial expectations.  Fab 4 costs on comparable technologies are in
fact lower than those of Fab 2.  We have
a significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment still to be placed in
service at Fab 4 that was acquired in the original acquisition of Fab 4
that we can bring on line in the future to support incremental wafer
fabrication capacity needs.  We believe
the combined capacity of Fab 2, Fab 4 and Fab 3 will provide sufficient
capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand.

We continue to transition
products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing
costs.  We believe that our ability to
successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for
us to remain competitive.  Our future
operating results could be adversely affected if any such transition is
substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented.

We also contract with
third-party wafer foundries to fabricate less than 3% of our total
production.  On a strategic basis, we
will continue to use third-party foundries to shorten our product design cycle
on certain key technologies and products.

Assembly
and Test

We perform product
assembly and testing at our facilities located near Bangkok, Thailand.  At March 31, 2005, approximately 70% of
our assembly requirements were being performed in our Thailand facility.  As of March 31, 2005, our Thailand
facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production.  A 67,000 square foot expansion area that was
placed in service in fiscal 2005 provides the Thailand facility with sufficient
space for our projected expansion needs in fiscal 2006.  We also use third-party assembly and test
contractors in several Asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test
requirements.

General
Matters Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations

We employ proprietary
design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory
products.  We believe our processes
afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and
greater functionality in new product designs. 
While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes
for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology
for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products.  This allows us to more fully absorb our
process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market
more rapidly.  Our engineers utilize
advanced Computer Aided Design tools and software to perform circuit design,
simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities
enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly
and efficiently.

Due to the high fixed
costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high manufacturing
yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall
operating results.  During fiscal 2005,
our focus on manufacturing productivity allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing
yields at our facilities.  Our
manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of
statistical process control, extensive employee training and selective
upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment.  Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and
yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results.  The manufacture and assembly of integrated
circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS memory and logic devices,
such as those that we produce, are complex processes.  These processes are sensitive to a wide
variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing
environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer
fabrication personnel and equipment.  As
is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced
lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. 
Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at
approximately the current levels.


Our semiconductor
manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet
exacting standards.  We generally have
more than one source for these supplies, but there are only a limited number of
suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet
our standards.  In addition, the raw
materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult
to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications
increases.  We have experienced supply
shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have
told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders.  An interruption of any raw materials or
equipment sources could harm our business.

Our reliance on third
parties for a portion of wafer fabrication and assembly and testing involves
some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that
we subcontract.  While we review the
quality, delivery and cost performance of these third-party contractors, our
future operating results could suffer if any third-party contractor is unable
to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at
approximately their current levels.

The
foregoing statements related to the combined capacity of Fab 2, Fab 4 and Fab 3
providing sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to future increases in
demand and the transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce
future manufacturing costs are forward-looking statements. Actual results could
differ materially because of the following factors, among others: changes in
utilization of our current manufacturing capacity; unanticipated costs in
ramping production at Fab 4; our ability to increase production at Fab 2; the
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the Portland, Oregon area;
changes in demand for products and the products of our customers; supply
disruption; absorption of fixed costs, labor and other direct manufacturing
costs; fluctuations in production yields; production efficiencies and overall
capacity utilization; changes in product mix; competitive pressures on prices;
labor unrest; political instability and expropriation; and other general
economic conditions.

At the end of fiscal
2005, we owned long-lived assets (consisting of property, plant and equipment
and goodwill) in the United States amounting to $622.3 million and $102.9 million
in other countries, including $100.6 million in Thailand.  At the end of fiscal 2004, we owned
long-lived assets in the United States amounting to $608.3 million and $113.2
million in other countries, including $111.7 million in Thailand.

Research and Development
(R&D)

We are committed to
continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development
systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are significant
factors in maintaining our competitive position.  Our current R&D activities focus on the
design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, ASSPs, memory and
mixed-signal products, new development systems, software and
application-specific software libraries. 
We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve
further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products.

In fiscal 2005, our
R&D expenses were $93.0

million,
compared to $85.4

million in fiscal 2004 and $88.0
million in fiscal 2003.

Sales and Distribution

General

We market our products
worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and
distributors.

Our direct sales force
focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets:
the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We
currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in
North America, Europe and Asia.  We
believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued
development of the embedded control market. 
The majority of our field sales engineers (FSEs), field application
engineers (FAEs), and sales management have technical degrees and have been
previously employed in an engineering environment.  We believe that the technical knowledge of
our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our
products.  The primary mission of our FAE
team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct
periodic training sessions for FSEs and distributor sales teams.  FAEs also frequently conduct technical
seminars in major cities around the world, and work closely with our
distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.


Distribution

Our distributors focus
primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a
broad base of diverse customers.  We
believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and
diverse customer base.

In fiscal 2005, we
derived 65% of our net sales from sales through distributors and 35% of our net
sales from direct sales to original equipment manufacturers, referred to as OEM
customers.  Distributors accounted for
64% of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.  Our largest distributor accounted for
approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.  Our second largest distributor accounted for
approximately 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.  In fiscal 2003, one distributor accounted for
12% of our net sales.  No other
distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in
fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Distributors generally
have broad-based rights to return product to us.  As revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized
until the distributors sell our product to their end customers, distributor
returns have no impact on our revenue.

We also grant certain
credits to our third-party distributors and also offer these distributors price
protection.  The credits are granted to
the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’
business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our
products to their end customers.  The
credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they
provide information regarding the sale to their end customer.  The effect of granting these credits
establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products
and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the
distributors to their end customers.

We reduce product pricing
through price protection based on market conditions, competitive considerations
and other factors.  Price protection is
granted to third-party distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at
the date the price protection is offered. 
When we reduce the selling price of our products, it allows the
distributors to claim a credit against their outstanding accounts receivables
balances based on the new price of the inventory they have on hand as of the
date of the price reduction.  There is no
revenue recognition impact from the price protection activity.

We do not offer material
incentive programs to our third-party distributors.

We do not have long-term
agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our
relationships with each other with little or no advanced notice.  The loss of, or the disruption in the
operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net
sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.

Sales
by Geography

Sales
by geography for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows (dollars in
thousands):

Sales
to customers in Asia have increased as a percentage of sales from fiscal 2003
to fiscal 2004 and from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005.  We attribute this primarily to many of our
customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to Asia.

Sales
to foreign customers accounted for approximately 73% of our net sales in fiscal
2005 and 71% of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.  Our sales to foreign customers have been
predominately in Asia and Europe, which we attribute to the manufacturing
strength in those areas for automotive, communications, computing, consumer and
industrial control products.  Americas
sales include sales to customers in the United States, Canada, Central America
and South America.


Sales
to customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 16% of
our net sales in fiscal 2005, approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2004
and 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2003. 
In fiscal 2005, sales to customers in Taiwan accounted for approximately
10% of our net sales.  We did not have
sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales
during fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Our
international sales are predominately U.S. dollar denominated.  Although foreign sales are subject to certain
government export restrictions, we have not experienced any material
difficulties as a result of export restrictions to date.

Our
foreign operations are subject to a number of risks as described under the
heading,

“We are highly dependent on foreign sales and
operations, which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks

,”
on page 16.

Backlog

As of April 29,
2005, our backlog was approximately $166.9 million, compared to $209.9 million
as of April 23, 2004.  Our backlog
includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12
months.

We primarily produce
standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after
we receive an order.  Our business and,
to a large extent, that of the entire semiconductor industry, is characterized
by short-term orders and shipment schedules. 
Orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in
delivery schedules, or to cancellation at the customer’s option without
significant penalty.  Thus, while backlog
is useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not
be a reliable measure of sales for any future period.

Competition

The semiconductor
industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion
and rapid technological change.  We
compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of
which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical,
marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue
engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.  Emerging companies may also increase their
participation in the market for embedded control applications.  Furthermore, capacity in the semiconductor
industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or
improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position.

We currently compete
principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our
embedded control products, including the following product characteristics:

•

speed

•

functionality

•

density

•

power consumption

•

reliability

•

packaging
alternatives

•

price,
and

•

availability.

We believe that other
important competitive factors in the embedded control market include:

•

ease
of use

•

functionality
of application development systems

•

dependable
delivery and quality, and

•

technical
service and support.

We believe that we
compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors, but we may be
unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business.

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks

We maintain a portfolio
of United States and foreign patents, expiring on various dates between 2005
and 2023.  We also have numerous
additional United States and foreign patent applications pending.  We do not expect that the expiration of any
particular patent will have a material impact on our business.  While we intend to continue to seek patents
on our inventions and manufacturing processes, we believe that our continued
success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities
of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments,
rather than on our


patents.  Our existing patents
and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength
to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us.  In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as
the laws of the United States.

We have entered into
certain intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with other companies
related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry,
we and our customers have from time to time received, and may in the future
receive, communications from third parties asserting patent or other
intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies.  We investigate all such notices and respond
as we believe is appropriate.  Based on
industry practice, we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary
licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms, but we cannot assure
that licenses would be on acceptable terms, that litigation would not ensue or
that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed.  Litigation, which could result in substantial
cost to us and require significant attention from management, may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, or to defend us
against claimed infringement of the rights of others.  The failure to obtain necessary licenses or
other rights, or litigation arising out of infringement claims, could harm our
business.

Environmental Regulation

We must comply with many
different federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the use,
storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our
manufacturing processes.  Our facilities
have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our
activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations.  Any changes in
such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire
costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with
environmental regulations.  Any failure
by us to control adequately the storage, use and disposal of regulated
substances could result in future liabilities.

Increasing public attention
has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing
operations.  While we have not
experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental
regulations, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of, or to
restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or
future environmental regulations.

Employees

As of April 30,
2005, we had 3,943 employees.  None of
our employees are represented by a labor organization.  We have never had a work stoppage and
believe that our employee relations are good.

Additional Factors That May Affect
Our Results of Operations

When evaluating Microchip
and its business, you should give careful consideration to the factors listed
below, in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K
and in other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Our
quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our
net sales and profitability

.

Our quarterly operating
results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net
sales and profitability, many of which are beyond our control.  Some of the factors that may affect our
quarterly operating results include:

•

changes
in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers

•

the
mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory

•

levels
of inventories at our customers

•

changes
in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing
yields

•

our
ability to secure sufficient assembly and testing capacity

•

competitive
developments including pricing pressures

•

the
level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter

•

the
level of sell-through of our products through distribution

•

changes
or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality

•

constrained availability from other
electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability to ship their products,
which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers

•

costs
and outcomes of any tax audits or any litigation involving intellectual
property, customers or other issues

•

disruptions in our business or our
customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, worldwide
oil prices and supply, public health concerns or disruptions in the
transportation system

•

property
damage or other losses which are not covered by insurance, and

•

general
economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or
internationally.


We believe that
period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily
meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as
indications of future performance.  In
future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the
expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a
negative effect on the price of our common stock.

Our
operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing
capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields.

The manufacture and
assembly of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable CMOS
memory and logic devices such as those that we produce, are complex
processes.  These processes are sensitive
to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the
manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance
of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry,
we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing
yields.  Our operating results will
suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels.

Our operating results are
also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity.  Lower capacity utilization results in certain
costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins.

We
are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and
therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments.

Our net sales in any
given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received
in that quarter for shipment in that quarter, which we refer to as turns
orders.  We measure turns orders at the
beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets
that we set entering the quarter.  Historically,
we have proven our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our
competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively
short delivery schedules.  Shorter lead
times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are
relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on
future product shipments.  Turns orders
correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead
times.  Because turns orders are
difficult to predict, varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more
difficult to forecast.  If we do not
achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to
our revenue targets, our revenue and operating results may suffer.

Intense
competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures, reduced
sales of our products or reduced market share.

The semiconductor
industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion
and rapid technological change.  We
compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of
which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial,
technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do with which to
pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their
products.  Emerging companies are also
increasing their participation in the market for embedded control
applications.  We may be unable to
compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business.

Our ability to compete
successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our
control, including:

•

the
quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use, pricing and diversity
of our products

•

our
success in designing and manufacturing new products including those
implementing new technologies

•

the
rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own applications

•

product
introductions by our competitors

•

the
number, nature and success of our competitors in a given market

•

our
ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other supplies at
acceptable prices

•

our
ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of
intellectual property rights

•

the
quality of our customer service and our ability to address the needs of our
customers, and

•

general
market and economic conditions.

Historically, average
selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any
particular product.  The overall average
selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface
products have remained relatively constant, while average selling prices of our
Serial EEPROM and non-proprietary analog and interface products have declined
over time.


We have experienced, and
expect to continue to experience, modest pricing declines in certain of our more
mature proprietary product lines, due primarily to competitive conditions.  We have been able to moderate average selling
price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to
introduce new products with more features and higher prices.  We have experienced in the past and expect to
continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing
pressures in our Serial EEPROM products.

We may be unable to
maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased
pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely impact our operating
results.

Our
business is highly dependent on selling through distributors.

Sales through
distributors accounted for 65% of our net sales in fiscal 2005, 64% of our net
sales in fiscal 2004 and 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.  Our two largest distributors together
accounted for approximately 25% of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004
and approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.  We do not have long-term agreements with our
distributors and our distributors may terminate their relationships with us
with little or no advanced notice.

The loss of, or a
disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce
our net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory
returns.

Our
success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis.

Our future operating
results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a
timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance
and which address customer requirements. 
The success of our new product introductions depends on various factors,
including:

•

proper
new product selection

•

timely
completion and introduction of new product designs

•

development of support tools and
collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand
and use, and

•

market
acceptance of our customers’ end products.

Because our products are
complex, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development
of new products.  In addition, our new
products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance.  We may be unable to design, develop and
introduce competitive products on a timely basis, which could adversely impact
our future operating results.

Our success also depends
upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process
technologies.  Semiconductor design and
process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require
significant R&D expenditures.  We and
other companies in the industry have, from time to time, experienced
difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and,
consequently, have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product
deliveries.  Our future operating results
could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is
substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented.

We
must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition
for qualified personnel is intense in our market.

Our success depends upon
the efforts and abilities of our senior management, engineering and other
personnel.  The competition for qualified
engineering and management personnel is intense.  We may be unsuccessful in retaining our
existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel
that we require.  The loss of the
services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key
personnel could harm our business.  We
have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team.

We
are dependent on several third-party contractors to perform key manufacturing
functions for us.

We use several
third-party contractors located in Asia for a portion of the assembly and
testing of our products.  We also rely on
outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication.  Although we own the majority of our
manufacturing resources, the disruption or termination of any of our
third-party contractors could harm our business and operating results.


Our use of third parties
involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our
business that we subcontract.  Our future
operating results could suffer if any third-party contractor were to experience
financial, operations or production difficulties or situations when demand
exceeds capacity, or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields,
assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels, or if
due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political
upheaval or infrastructure disruption. 
In such case, we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing
sources for our products in a timely manner or at all, and such arrangements,
if any, may not be on favorable terms to us. 
In such event, our business and operating results could be adversely
affected.

We
may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our
needs.

Our semiconductor
manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet
exacting standards.  We generally have
more than one source for these supplies, but there are only a limited number of
suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet
our standards.  The raw materials and
equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as
worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases.  We have experienced supply shortages from
time to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need
more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support
certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts.  An interruption of any raw materials or
equipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of
equipment, could harm our business.

Our
operating results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of supply and demand
in the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor
industry is characterized by wide fluctuations of supply and demand.  The industry has experienced significant
economic downturns, characterized by diminished product demand and production
over-capacity.  We have sought to reduce
our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that
cannot be easily or quickly replaced, to a geographically diverse base of
customers across a broad range of market segments.  However, we have experienced substantial
period-to-period fluctuations in operating results and expect, in the future,
to experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general
industry or economic conditions.

We
are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims.

We are currently, and in
the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent
infringement, intellectual property rights, contracts and other matters.  From October 2001 to October 2004,
we were involved in patent infringement litigation with Philips Corporation
which has since been settled.  However,
as is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications from
customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or
other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by
third parties.  These legal proceedings
and claims, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial cost to
us and divert our resources.  If we are
not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a settlement of a matter, obtain
necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully
prosecute or defend our position, we could incur uninsured liability in any one
of them and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
harmed.

It is also possible that
from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims
that could lead to significant expenses related to the defense of such claims
or any requirement to pay damages claims. 
We do have product liability insurance, but there is no certainty that
insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against
such claims.  Costs or payments we may
make in connection with warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect
the results of our operations.

Failure
to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or
market opportunities.

Our ability to obtain
patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products
and manufacturing processes is important for our success.  To that end, we have acquired certain patents
and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions
and manufacturing processes.  The process
of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and patents may not be
issued from currently pending or future applications.  In addition, our existing patents and any new
patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide
meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us.  We may be subject to or may initiate
interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which can
require significant financial and management resources.  In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as
the laws of the United States. 
Infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could
result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us.


We do
not have long-term contracts with our customers

.

We do not typically enter
into long-term contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about
future order levels from our customers. 
When we do enter into customer contracts, the contract is generally
cancelable at the convenience of the customer. 
In the event of any early termination of a contract by one of our major
customers, it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly replace that revenue
source which could harm our financial results.

Business
interruptions could harm our business.

Operations at any of our
manufacturing facilities, or at any of our wafer fabrication or test and
assembly subcontractors, may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control,
including work stoppages, power loss, incidents of terrorism or security risk,
political instability, public health issues, telecommunications, transportation
or other infrastructure failure, fire, earthquake, floods, or other natural
disasters.  If operations at any of our
facilities, or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted, we may not be
able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis.  If this occurs, we would likely experience
delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for
production may be unavailable on acceptable terms.  This could result in reduced revenues and
profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers.  In addition, business interruption insurance
will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and
any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions
could significantly harm our business.

We
are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations, which exposes us to
foreign political and economic risks.

Sales to foreign
customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales.  During fiscal 2005, approximately 73% of our
net sales were made to foreign customers. 
During fiscal 2004, approximately 71% of our net sales were made to
foreign customers.  We purchase a
substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign
suppliers.  In addition, we own product
assembly and testing facilities located near Bangkok, Thailand.  We also use various foreign third-party
contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our
wafer fabrication requirements. 
Substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in
Thailand.

Our reliance on foreign
operations, foreign suppliers, maintenance of substantially all of our finished
goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes
us to foreign political and economic risks, including:

•

political,
social and economic instability

•

public
health conditions

•

trade
restrictions and changes in tariffs

•

import
and export license requirements and restrictions

•

difficulties
in staffing and managing international operations

•

employment
regulations

•

disruptions
in international transport or delivery

•

fluctuations
in currency exchange rates

•

difficulties
in collecting receivables

•

economic
slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us, and

•

potentially
adverse tax consequences.

If any of these risks
materialize, our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer.

We
are subject to stringent environmental regulations, which may force us to incur
significant expenses.

We must comply with many
different federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the use,
storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous
chemicals used in our manufacturing process. 
Although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable
environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production
or a cessation of operations.  Any such
environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to
incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations.  Any failure by us to control the use of or
adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to
future liabilities.  Environmental
problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities.


Further, certain of our
customers shipping their products into European markets are also subject to
governmental environmental regulations such as the Restriction of Hazardous
Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) which will
be effective July 1, 2006, and the Directive on Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment.  These directives
focus on limiting the amounts of certain elements, such as lead, in electrical
devices, and providing for the proper disposal of the electrical devices and
their components.  The inability of this
sub-set of our customers to use Microchip products which contain lead after July 2006
may adversely affect our results of operations.

Recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related
regulations have resulted in increased costs to us.

Recently enacted and
proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies,
including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and recent rules enacted
and proposed by the SEC, NASDAQ and the NYSE, have resulted in significantly
increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements.  In particular, complying with the internal
control audit requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 has resulted in
increased internal efforts and significantly higher fees from our independent
accounting firm.

This report on Form 10-K
contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial
reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005.  This Form 10-K also contains an
attestation and report by our auditors with respect to our management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
under Section 404.  While these
assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, compliance with Section 404 is an
ongoing process and will be required for each future fiscal year.  We expect that the ongoing compliance with Section 404
will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no
assurance that material weaknesses with not be identified in future
periods.  Any adverse results from such
ongoing compliance efforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our
financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Recent
regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our earnings
and our ability to attract and retain key personnel.

Since our inception, we
have used stock options and other long-term equity incentives as a fundamental
component of our employee compensation packages and have accounted for them
using the intrinsic value method of APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.”  We believe that
stock options and other long-term equity incentives directly motivate our
employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use no of
vesting, encourage employees to remain with Microchip.  In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payments,” (SFAS
123R) which changed U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in such a way
to require us to record a charge to earnings for the fair value of employee
stock option grants and other share based compensation beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2007.  This regulation
will negatively impact our earnings for those share based awards that vest
beginning in fiscal 2007.  For example,
recording a charge for employee stock options under SFAS 123 would have
decreased our net income by $37.2 million, $36.8 million and $36.2 million for
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The impact on net income of SFAS 123R may
differ significantly than the impact as calculated under SFAS 123.  Furthermore, adoption of SFAS 123R will
require us to make certain assumptions and judgments in the valuation of stock
options that we may grant in the future. A change in any of those assumptions
or judgments could change the compensation expense that is charged against our
earnings and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations.  See also Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements – Significant Accounting Policies: 
Share-Based Payment.

In addition, recent regulations
implemented by The NASDAQ Stock Market requiring shareholder approval for all
stock option plans as well as recent regulations implemented by the New York
Stock Exchange prohibiting NYSE member organizations from giving a proxy to
vote on equity-compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has
given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant equity-based
awards to employees in the future.  To
the extent that these or other new regulations make it more difficult or
expensive to grant options to employees, we may incur compensation costs, productivity
losses, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to
attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could materially and
adversely affect our business.

The
future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations
in response to a variety of factors.

The market price of our
common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to
fluctuate in the future.  The future
trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in
response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control,
including:


•

quarterly
variations in our operating results and the operating results of other
technology companies

•

actual
or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or
our competitors

•

changes
in analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or buy/sell recommendations

•

changes
in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance

•

general
conditions in the semiconductor industry, and

•

worldwide
economic and financial conditions.

In addition, the stock
market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have
particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and
that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such
companies.  These broad market
fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our common stock.

Item 2.

PROPERTIES

At March 31, 2005,
we owned the facilities described below:

In
addition to the facilities we own, we lease several research and development
facilities and sales offices in North America, Europe and Asia.

Our aggregate monthly rental payment
for our leased facilities is approximately $0.4 million.

We currently believe that
our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our production requirements
for the next 12 months.

The
foregoing statements related to the acquisition of title to the land on which
the Thailand facility is situated and the adequacy of existing facilities for
the next 12 months are forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially
because of the following factors, among others: developments in the financial
restructuring of the seller of the land where the Thailand facility is
situated; demand for our products; fluctuations in production yields,
production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization; competitive pressures
on prices; political instability and expropriation; and other economic
conditions.  See also the factors set
forth under “Item 1 – Business – Additional Factors That May Affect
Results of Operations,” beginning at page 12 of this report.


Item 3.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of
our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as
plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more
of them.  Although the outcome of these actions
is not presently determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  Litigation relating to the semiconductor
industry is not uncommon, and we are, and from time to time have been, subject
to such litigation.  No assurances can be
given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the
future.

MARKET FOR
  REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES
  OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is
traded on the The NASDAQ National Market

®

under the symbol “MCHP.”  Our common stock has been quoted on The NASDAQ
National Market since our initial public offering on March 19, 1993.  The following table sets forth the quarterly
high and low closing prices of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ
National Market for the last two years.

On May 16, 2005,
there were approximately 505 holders of record of our common stock.  This figure does not reflect beneficial
ownership of shares held in nominee names.

We have been declaring
and paying quarterly cash dividends since the third quarter of fiscal
2003.  Our total cash dividends paid were
$43.0 million, $23.3 million and $8.1 million in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003, respectively.  The following
table sets forth our quarterly cash dividends per common share and the total
amount of the dividend payment each quarter in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004
(amounts in thousands, except per share amounts).

On April 27, 2005,
we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.095 per share, which will be paid
on June 3, 2005 to stockholders of record on May 13, 2005 and is
estimated to be $19.8 million.  Our Board
is free to change its dividend practices at any time and to decrease or
increase the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend, on our common stock on
the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements
and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  Our current intent is to provide for ongoing
quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of
operations.

Balance Sheet Data (1):

(1)

On January 16, 2001, we merged with TelCom
Semiconductor, Inc. and accounted for the merger as a pooling-of-interests.  Accordingly, the selected financial data has
been restated to include the operations of TelCom for all periods
presented.  TelCom had a December 31
fiscal year end, and we have conformed the TelCom financial data to a March 31
year end for the March 31, 2001 fiscal year.

There were no
special charges during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002.  Detailed discussions of the special charges
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are contained in
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Detailed explanations of the special charges for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 are provided below.  The following table presents a summary of
special charges for the five-year period ended March 31, 2005:

We changed our
revenue recognition policy as it relates to Asia regional distributors during
fiscal 2003.  See “Item 7 –

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations – Change in Accounting Principle,

” beginning at page 36
below, for a discussion of this change.

Fiscal 2001

During the March 2001
quarter, we implemented capacity and cost reduction actions necessitated by
adverse business conditions in the semiconductor industry.  We reduced cumulative wafer fab capacity at
Fabs 1 and 2 by approximately 24%, compared to our December 31, 2000
levels.  We also decided to close our
Hong Kong test facility, acquired as part of the TelCom transaction, and
migrate these test requirements to our Thailand test facility.  The capacity reduction at Fabs 1 and 2 was
completed by the end of the March 2001 quarter.  The closure of the Hong Kong facility was
completed by June 30, 2001.  These
actions resulted in a restructuring charge of $6.4 million in the March 2001
quarter.  These actions were undertaken
to reduce both manufacturing capacity and manufacturing costs.  The reduction in wafer fab capacity was
required due to reduced customer demand. 
The closure of the Hong Kong facility was undertaken to rationalize our
test manufacturing capacity and migrate the test requirements to our more
cost-effective test facility in Thailand.


Included in the
restructuring charges resulting from these actions were:

•

$4.0
million related to equipment that was written off

•

$2.1
million related to employee severance costs, and

•

$0.3
million related to other restructuring costs.

On January 16, 2001,
we completed our merger with TelCom. 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, we exchanged each share of
TelCom common stock for 0.795 of a share of our common stock.  We issued 14,702,184 shares of our common
stock and assumed all outstanding TelCom stock options.  The transaction was structured as a tax-free
reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.

During the March 2001
quarter, we recognized a special charge of $10.9 million for costs associated
with the TelCom transaction.  These costs
included:

•

$7.3
million associated with investment banking fees

•

$1.6
million associated with legal and accounting fees

•

$0.9
million of severance costs, and

•

$1.1
million related to other costs.

All reserves relating to
the special charges for the fiscal 2001 actions have been fully utilized and
there were no reversals of previously provided amounts.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties, including statements regarding our strategy, financial
performance and revenue sources.  We use
words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “estimate,” “future,” “intend”
and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.  Our actual results could differ materially
from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of
certain factors including those set forth in this Item 7, and under “Item 1 –
Business – Additional Factors That May Affect Our Results of Operations,”
beginning at page 12, above, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Although we believe that the expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  You should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements.  We disclaim
any obligation to update information contained in any forward-looking
statement.

We
begin our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (MD&A) with a summary of Microchip’s overall business
strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the
overall direction of our business and products. 
This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and
judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.  In the next section, beginning at page 26,
we discuss our Results of Operations for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004,
and for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. 
We then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash
flows, and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “Liquidity and
Capital Resources,” “Contractual Obligations” and “Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements.”

This MD&A should be
read in conjunction with other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
including “Item 1 – Business”; “Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”; and “Item 8 –
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Strategy

Our goal is to be a
worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide
variety of embedded control applications. 
Our strategic focus is on embedded control products, which include
microcontrollers, high-performance linear and mixed signal devices, power
management and thermal management devices, and complementary microperipheral
products including interface devices, Serial EEPROMs, and our patented KEELOQ
security devices.  We provide
highly cost-effective embedded control products that also offer the advantages
of small size, high performance, low voltage/power operation and ease of
development, enabling timely and cost-effective embedded control product
integration by our customers.


Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and
assembly and test.  The ownership of our
manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy,
enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us
being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning our wafer fabrication facilities
and much of our assembly and test operations, and by employing proprietary statistical
process control techniques, we have been able to achieve and maintain high
production yields.  Direct control over
manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.  This control also allows us to capture the
wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit margin.

We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in
developing our embedded control products. 
We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in
existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product
designs.  While many of our competitors
develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product
lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and
non-volatile memory products.  This
allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and
to deliver new products to market more rapidly. 
Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design (CAD) tools and
software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house
photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design
techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently.

We are committed to
continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development
systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are significant
factors in maintaining our competitive position.  Our current research and development
activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal
controllers, ASSPs, memory and mixed-signal products, new development systems,
software and application-specific software libraries.  We are also developing new design and process
technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in
existing products.

We market our products
worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and
distributors.  Our distributors focus
primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a
broad base of diverse customers.  We
believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and
diverse customer base.  Our direct sales
force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical
markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia. 
We currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan
areas in North America, Europe and Asia. 
We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the
continued development of the embedded control market.  Many of our field sales engineers (FSEs),
field application engineers (FAEs), and sales management have technical degrees
and have been previously employed in an engineering environment.  We believe that the technical knowledge of
our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our
products.  The primary mission of our FAE
team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct
periodic training sessions for FSEs and distributor sales teams.  FAEs also frequently conduct technical
seminars in major cities around the world, and work closely with our
distributors to provide technical assistance and end-user support.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and
analysis of Microchip’s financial condition and results of operations is based
upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  We review the accounting
policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.  The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
inventories, income taxes, property plant and equipment, impairment of
property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. 
Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being
different from those on which we based our assumptions.  We review these estimates and judgments on an
ongoing basis.  We believe the following
critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  We also have other policies that we consider
key accounting policies, such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to
OEMs; however, we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or
judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below.


Revenue Recognition – Distributors

Our distributors
worldwide have broad rights to return products and price protection rights, so
we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their
customers.  We reduce product pricing
through price protection based on market conditions, competitive considerations
and other factors.  Price protection is
granted to third-party distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at
the date the price protection is offered. 
When we reduce the price of our products, it allows the distributor to
claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on
the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price
reduction.  There is no revenue impact
from the price protections.  We also
grant certain credits to our third-party distributors.  The credits are granted to the distributors
on specially identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to
earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end
customers.  The credits are on a per unit
basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide documentation of
the sale to their end customer.  The
effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to
our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by
us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers.  Upon shipment, amounts billed to distributors
are included as accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, and the sale and
the gross margin are deferred and are reflected as a current liability until
the product is sold by the distributor to their customers.  We changed our revenue recognition policy as
it relates to sales to Asia regional distributors during fiscal 2003 as described
below at page 36 and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements to
conform with our revenue recognition policies for our distribution channels in
the Americas and Europe.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at
the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  We write down our inventory for estimated
obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference
between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be
required.  Inventory impairment charges
establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently
reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying
amounts are recoverable.  In estimating
our reserves for obsolescence, we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a
12-month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the
estimated 12-month demand.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate
our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  This process involves estimating our actual
current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting
from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance
sheet.  We must then assess the
likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that
recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.  We have not provided for a valuation
allowance because we believe that it is “more likely than not” that our
deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income.  Should we determine that we would not be able
to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period
such determination was made.  At March 31,
2005, our gross deferred tax asset was $105.1 million.

Various taxing
authorities in the United States and other countries in which we do business
are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by
businesses.  Companies of our size and
complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions
in which they conduct significant operations. 
We are currently under audit by the United States Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) for our fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1999, 2000 and
2001.  As part of this ongoing audit, the
IRS has proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these
returns.  The IRS has issued formal
assessments for these adjustments.  We do
not agree with these adjustments and intend to appeal these assessments.  We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are
probable.  We believe that we maintain
adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise
upon final resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the
appeals process with the IRS.  We also
believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax
liabilities that may arise upon other audits in the United States and other countries
in which we do business.  If such amounts
ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves
would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no
longer deemed necessary.  If such amounts
ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to
expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined.


The
foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and
the adequacy of our tax reserves are forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially
because of the following factors, among others: results of any audit conducted
by the various taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business; the
level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient
to realize the benefits available from our deferred tax assets; current and
future tax laws and regulations; and taxation rates in geographic regions where
we have significant operations.

Property, Plant & Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost.  Major
renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are
expensed when incurred.  At March 31,
2005, the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled $693.3 million,
which represents 38.1% of our total assets. 
This carrying value reflects the application of our property and
equipment accounting policies, which incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments
relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from
five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30 years on
buildings.

We began production
activities at Fab 4 on October 31, 2003. 
We began to depreciate the Fab 4 assets as the assets were placed in
service for production purposes.  As of March 31,
2005, all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as
well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service.  All manufacturing equipment that was not
being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and
is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management
believes there is no change to its utility from the present time until it is
placed into productive service.  The
lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at Fab 4 will be evaluated at
such time as the assets are placed in service. 
We do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired
the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets.

On March 31, 2005,
we changed the classification of Fab 3 from an asset held-for-sale to an asset
held-for-future-use.  Fab 3 had been on
the market for over two years, and we had not received any acceptable offers on
the facility.  Over that period of time,
our business had increased significantly and over the next several years we will
need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger
percentage of Fab 4’s clean room capacity is utilized.  We determined that the appropriate action to
take was to stop actively marketing the Fab 3 facility and hold it for our
future use.  As a result of this change
in classification, we had to assess the fair value of the Fab 3 asset to
determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in
classification from “held-for-sale” to “held-for-future-use” under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144.  We performed a discounted cash flow analysis
of the Fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the
fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique
for the asset.  The discounted cash flow
analysis confirmed the carrying value of the Fab 3 asset at March 31, 2005
was not in excess of its fair value.  If
indicators of impairment for the Fab 3 assets arise in the future, we will
determine if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to
the assets in question are less than their carrying value.  If less, we would recognize an impairment
loss on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective
fair values.  We will begin to depreciate
the Fab 3 asset in April 2005.

The estimates,
assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and
equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations
regarding future industry conditions and operations.  The use of different estimates, assumptions
and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and
expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations, would likely
result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of
operations.

We do not currently hold
title to the land on which our Thailand facility resides.  The land is subject to a complex
restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land.  We have provided reserves that we estimate
will be adequate to obtain full title. 
Such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land.  However, timing of the resolution is
difficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change.

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment

We
assess whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present.  If such indicators are present, we determine
whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the
assets in question is less than their carrying value.  If less, we recognize an impairment loss
based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective
fair values.  Fair value is determined by
discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods.  If the assets determined to


be
impaired are to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss through a
charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated
net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying
value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the
asset. We may incur impairment losses, or additional losses on already impaired
assets, in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change.

Litigation

Our current estimated
range of liability related to certain pending litigation is based on the
probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of
loss.  Recorded reserves were not
significant at March 31, 2005.

Because of the
uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range
of loss on the remaining pending litigation, we are unable to make a reasonable
estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  As additional information becomes available,
we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and
revise our estimates.  Revisions in our
estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of
operation and financial position.

Results of Operations

The following table sets
forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years
indicated:

Net Sales

We
operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products.  We sell our products to distributors and OEMs
in a broad range of market segments, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers and generally require no collateral.

Our
net sales of $846.9 million in fiscal 2005 increased by $147.6 million, or 21.1%,
over fiscal 2004, and net sales of $699.3 million in fiscal 2004 increased by
$47.8 million, or 7.3%, over fiscal 2003. 
The increases in net sales in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and in
fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from increased demand,
predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller products. Average selling
prices for our products were down approximately 4% in fiscal 2005 over fiscal
2004 and 9% in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. 
The number of units of our products sold was up approximately 26% in
fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 and 17% in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003.  The average selling prices and the unit
volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold.  We believe that we have continued to grow our
percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three
fiscal years.  Key factors in achieving
the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include:

•

continued
market share gains

•

increasing
semiconductor content in our customers’ products

•

customers’
increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions

•

our
new product offerings that have increased our served available market, and

•

increasing
demand for our products.

We recognize revenue from
product sales upon shipment to OEMs.  Under our shipping terms, legal
title passes to the customer upon shipment from Microchip.  We have no post shipment obligations.  Distributors worldwide generally have broad
rights to return products and price protection rights, so we defer revenue
recognition until the distributors sell the


product to their
customers.  Upon shipment, amounts billed
to distributors are included in accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, the
sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until
the product is sold by the distributors to their customers.

During the quarter ended December 31,
2003, we changed our accounting policy relating to amounts billed to customers
for shipping and handling costs to be consistent with EITF
00-10.  With this change, we have
reclassified amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs from a
reduction of cost of sales to revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal
2004, and we have continued this treatment in all subsequent periods.  This reclassification had no impact on net
income and an immaterial impact on revenues and cost of sales.  Prior year amounts have not been
reclassified, as these amounts were immaterial.

Sales by product line for
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows
(dollars in thousands):

Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.

Microcontrollers

Our
microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net
sales.  Microcontrollers and associated
application development systems accounted for approximately 79.7% of our total
net sales in fiscal 2005, approximately 79.6% of our total net sales in fiscal
2004 and approximately 79.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2003.

Net
sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 21.2% in fiscal
2005 compared to fiscal 2004, and increased approximately 7.8% in fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003.  The increases
in net sales were primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller
products in end markets, driven principally by market share gains and those
factors described above under “

Net Sales

” at page 26.  The end markets that we serve include the
automotive, communications, computing, consumer and industrial control markets.

Historically,
average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of
any particular product.  The overall
average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively
constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products.  We have experienced, and expect to continue
to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product
lines, primarily due to competitive conditions.  We have in the past been able to, and expect in
the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our
microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features at
higher prices.  However, we may be unable
to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result
of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our
operating results.

Memory
Products

Sales
of our memory products accounted for approximately 13.6% of our total net sales
in fiscal 2005, approximately 13.1% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 and
approximately 13.4% of our total net sales in fiscal 2003.

Net
sales of our memory products increased approximately 25.6% in fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004, and increased approximately 5.1% in fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003, driven primarily by customer demand conditions within
the Serial EEPROM market, which products comprise
substantially all of our memory product net sales.

Serial
EEPROM product pricing has historically been cyclical
in nature, with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price
stability, driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the
business cycle.  During the past three
fiscal years, we have experienced several Serial EEPROM
product pricing trends, both up and down, due to market


conditions.  We have experienced, and expect to continue
to experience, varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our Serial EEPROM products.  We
may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our Serial EEPROM products as a result of increased pricing pressure
in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Analog
and Interface Products

Sales
of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 6.7% of our
total net sales in fiscal 2005, 7.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 and
approximately 7.3% of our total net sales in fiscal 2003.

Net
sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 11.9% in
fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and increased approximately 6.1% in fiscal
2004 compared to fiscal 2003.  The
increase in net sales of our analog and interface products in these periods
were driven primarily by new proprietary design wins, supply and demand
conditions within the market and our ability to gain market share.

Analog
and interface products can be proprietary or non-proprietary in nature.  Currently, we consider more than half of our
analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature, where prices are
relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our
microcontroller products.  The
non-proprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience
price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those
products.  We may be unable to maintain
the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of
increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our
operating results.  We anticipate the
proprietary portion of our analog and interface products to increase over time.

Turns
Orders

Our
net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from
backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter, which
we refer to as turns orders.  We measure
turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet
the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter.  Historically, we have proven our ability to
respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy,
resulting in customers placing orders with short delivery schedules.  Shorter lead times generally mean that turns
orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular
quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments.  Turns orders correlate to overall
semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times.  Turns orders are difficult to predict, and we
may not experience the combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog
in a quarter that would be sufficient to achieve anticipated net sales.  If we do not achieve a sufficient level of
turns orders in a particular quarter, our net sales and operating results may
suffer.

The foregoing statements
regarding competitive pricing pressure in our microcontroller, Serial EEPROM and analog and interface product lines, our ability
to moderate future average selling price declines in our microcontroller
product lines and the proprietary portion of our analog and interface product
lines increasing over time are forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially
because of the following factors, among others: the level of orders that are
received and can be shipped in a quarter; changes in demand for our products
and the products of our customers; the level and timing at which previous
design wins become actual orders and sales; inventory mix and timing of
customer orders; customers’ inventory levels, order patterns and seasonality;
level of sell-through of our products through distribution in any particular
fiscal period; our ability to ramp products into volume production; competition
and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability; disruptions in
commercial activities, or international transport or delivery occasioned by
terrorist activity, armed conflict, war or an unexpected increase in the price
of, or decrease in the supply of, oil resulting in reduced end-user purchases
relative to expectations; impact of events outside the United States, such as
the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political
instability; the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the
markets addressed by our products; market acceptance of our new products and
those of our customers; the financial condition of our customers; fluctuations
in production yields, production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization;
changes in product mix; absorption of fixed costs, labor and other fixed
manufacturing costs; and general industry, economic and political conditions.


Distribution

Distributors
accounted for 65% of our net sales in fiscal 2005, 64% of our net sales in
fiscal 2004 and 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.

Our
largest distributor accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal
2005 and fiscal 2004 and 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.  Our two largest distributors accounted for 25%
of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.

Generally,
we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our
distributors, may terminate their relationships with us with little or no
advanced notice.  The loss of, or the
disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce
our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in
inventory returns.

At
March 31, 2005, distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 2.3
months of inventory of our products. 
Over the past three fiscal years, the months of inventory maintained by
our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 2.0 months and 2.8
months.  Thus, inventory levels at our
distributors are at the low to moderate end of the range we have experienced
over the last three years.  As we
recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors, we do not
believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially
impact our net sales.

Distributors
generally have broad-based rights to return product to us.  As revenue on distributor shipments is not
recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end customers,
distributor returns have no impact on revenue recognition.

We
also grant certain credits to our third-party distributors and also offer these
distributors price protection.  The
credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of
the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on
the sale of our products to their end customers.  The credits are on a per unit basis and are
not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale
to their end customer.  The effect of
granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our
distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us
when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers.

We
reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions,
competitive considerations and other factors. 
Price protection is granted to third-party distributors on the inventory
that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered.  When we reduce the selling price of our
products, it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding
accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on
hand as of the date of the price reduction. 
There is no revenue recognition impact from the price protections.

We
do not offer material incentive programs to our third-party distributors.

The foregoing statements
regarding our expectation that distributors will increase their current
inventory levels and our belief that inventory holding patterns at our
distributors will not materially impact our net sales are forward-looking
statements.  Actual results could differ
materially because of the following factors, among others: the rate of recovery
in the overall economy and the uncertainty of current economic and political
conditions; changes in demand for our products and the products of our
customers; the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual
orders and sales; inventory mix and timing of customer orders; customers’
inventory levels, order patterns and seasonality; the impact on our business and
customer order patterns due to major public health concerns, such as the SARS virus; level of sell-through of our products through
distribution in any particular fiscal period; disruptions in commercial
activities, or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist
activity, armed conflict, war or an unexpected increase in the price of, or
decrease in the supply of, oil resulting in reduced end-user purchases relative
to expectations; impact of events outside the United States, such as the business
impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability; the
cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by
our products; market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers;
and the financial condition of our customers.


Sales by Geography

Sales
by geography for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
as follows (dollars in thousands):

Our
sales to foreign customers have been predominately in Asia and Europe, which we
attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive,
communications, computing, consumer and industrial control products.  Americas sales include sales to customers in
the United States, Canada, Central America and South America.  Sales to customers in Asia have increased
during the last three fiscal years due to many of our customers transitioning
their manufacturing operations to Asia.

Sales
to foreign customers accounted for approximately 73% of our net sales in fiscal
2005, and 71% of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.  Substantially all of our foreign sales are
U.S. dollar denominated.

Sales
to customers in China, including Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 16% of
our net sales in fiscal 2005, approximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2004
and approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal 2003.  Sales to customers in Taiwan accounted for
approximately 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2005.  We did not have sales into any other
countries that exceeded 10% of our net sales during the last three fiscal
years.

Gross
Profit

Our
gross profit was $484.0 million in fiscal 2005, $350.0 million in fiscal 2004
and $352.2 million in fiscal 2003.  Gross
profit as a percent of sales was 57.1% in fiscal 2005, 50.0% in fiscal 2004 and
54.1% in fiscal 2003.

The most significant
factors affecting gross profit percentage over the past three fiscal years
were:

•

Improvements
in capacity utilization and product absorption, which positively affected gross
margin by $11.8 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, and by
$10.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.

•

$31.8
million in accelerated depreciation and other costs associated with the closure
of Fab 1, which negatively affected gross margin in
fiscal 2004.

•

Changes
in period cost of sales in Fab 3 and Fab 4, our non-operational facilities at certain times
during the last three fiscal years, which negatively impact gross margin.  Period cost of sales amounted to $3.3 million
in fiscal 2005, $18.1 million

in fiscal 2004
and $13.1 million in fiscal 2003.

•

A
one-week unpaid shutdown negatively affecting gross profit by $1.7 million in
fiscal 2004.  The shutdown occurred in
the three months ended September 30, 2003 and had a negative impact on
gross profit due to the fact that certain fixed costs including depreciation,
utilities, property taxes and other ongoing costs continued when the factory
was shut down.  There were no shutdowns
in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2003.

Other factors that
impacted gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include:

•

continued
cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such
as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques

•

factors
impacting the average selling prices of our products

•

fluctuations
in the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and analog products and
related Serial EEPROM products, and

•

inventory
write-offs and the sale of inventory that was previously written off.


During
fiscal 2005, we operated at approximately 96% of our Fab
2 capacity, which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal
2004.  During fiscal 2004, we operated at
approximately 91% of our Fab 2 capacity, which
favorably impacted gross margins, compared to fiscal 2003.  During fiscal 2003, we operated at
approximately 85% of our cumulative total Fab 1 and Fab 2 capacity.  Our
utilization of Fab 4’s total capacity is at
relatively low levels although we are utilizing all of the installed equipment
base.  We expect to maintain the current level
of capacity utilization at Fab 2 and Fab 4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

The
process technologies utilized impact our gross margins.  Fab 2 currently
utilizes various manufacturing process technologies, but predominantly utilizes
our 0.5 to 1.0 micron processes.  Fab 4 currently utilizes our 0.5 micron process
technology.  We continue to transition
products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing
costs.  Since the closure of Fab 1 in June 2003, all of our production has been on
8-inch wafers.  In fiscal 2003 and the
first quarter of fiscal 2004, approximately 80% of our production was on 8-inch
wafers.

Our
overall inventory levels were $103.7 million at March 31, 2005, compared
to $94.5 million at March 31, 2004 and $102.3 million at March 31,
2003.  We maintained 107 days of
inventory on our balance sheet at March 31, 2005 compared to 101 days of
inventory at March 31, 2004 and 128 days at March 31, 2003.

We
anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by
the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog and interface and memory
products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a
particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption,
capacity utilization levels, particularly those at Fab 4,
and competitive and economic conditions.

The foregoing statements relating
to our expectation to maintain the current level of capacity utilization at Fab 2 and Fab 4 during the first
quarter of fiscal 2006, our transition to more advanced process technologies to
reduce future manufacturing costs and the fluctuation of gross margins over
time are forward-looking statements. 
Actual results could differ materially because of the following factors,
among others: changes in demand for our products and the products of our
customers; fluctuations in production yields, production efficiencies and
overall capacity utilization; absorption of fixed costs, labor and other direct
manufacturing costs; competition and competitive pressure on pricing; disruptions
in commercial activities, or international transport or delivery occasioned by
terrorist activity, armed conflict, war or an unexpected increase in the price
of, or decrease in the supply of, oil resulting in reduced end-user purchases
relative to expectations; impact of events outside the United States, such as
the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political
instability; our ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed; cost and
availability of raw materials; changes in product mix; and other general
industry, economic and political conditions.

At March 31, 2005,
approximately 70% of our assembly requirements were being performed in our
Thailand facility, compared to approximately 71% as of March 31, 2004 and
approximately 77% at March 31, 2003. 
Third-party contractors located in Asia perform the balance of our
assembly operations.  Substantially all
of our test requirements were being performed in our Thailand facility over the
last three fiscal years.  We believe that
the assembly and test operations performed at our Thailand facility provide us
with significant cost savings when compared to third-party contractor assembly
and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the
manufacturing process.

We
rely on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication
requirements.

Our
use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the
portions of our business that we subcontract. 
While we review the quality, delivery and cost performance of our
third-party contractors, our future operating results could suffer if any
third-party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and
test yields and costs at approximately their current levels.

Research and Development
(R&D)

R&D
expenses for fiscal 2005 were $93.0 million, or 11.0% of sales, compared to
$85.4 million, or 12.2% of sales, for fiscal 2004 and $88.0 million, or 13.5%
of sales, for fiscal 2003.  We are
committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development
systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process
technologies.  We believe these
investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  We expense all R&D costs as
incurred.  R&D expenses include
expenditures for labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for
the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support
new products and design environments.


R&D
expenses increased $7.6 million, or 9.0%, for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004.  The primary reasons for the dollar increase
in R&D costs in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was higher labor costs
as a result of expanding our technical resources and increases in bonuses.  R&D expenses decreased $2.6 million, or
3.0%, for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. 
The primary reasons for the dollar decrease in R&D costs in fiscal
2004 compared to fiscal 2003 were reductions in professional services and lower
costs associated with product prototyping which were partially offset by
increases in labor costs.

Selling, General and
Administrative

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2005 were $111.2

million, or 13.1% of sales, compared to $92.4 million, or
13.2% of sales, for fiscal 2004, and $89.4 million, or 13.7% of sales, for
fiscal 2003.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales,
marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional
expenditures and legal expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related
to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales
offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection
and use of our products.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased $18.8

million,
or 20.3% for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 
The primary reasons for the dollar increases in selling, general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 were higher labor costs
as a result of expanding our internal resources, increases in bonuses,
increases in travel expenses and increases in audit and legal services.  Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $3.0 million, or 3.4%, for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003.  The primary reasons for the dollar increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003
were increases in labor costs and travel expenses.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and
operating expense investment levels.

Special
Charges

The following table
presents a summary of special charges for the fiscal years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands).

Fiscal 2005

Settlement with
U.S. Philips Corporation

We reached an agreement
with U.S. Philips Corporation and Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together
“Philips”) regarding patent license litigation between Philips and ourselves
which had been ongoing from October 2001 to October 2004.  The agreement includes dismissal of the then pending
litigation and the cross-license of certain patents between Philips and
Microchip.  We recorded a special charge
of $21.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2004 associated with this
matter.  As part of the settlement, we
licensed certain of our patents related to 8-pin microcontrollers to Philips,
and Philips licensed its patents related to I


C serial
communications to us, each on fully-paid up, non-royalty bearing worldwide
licenses.  The definitive agreement
related to this matter was finalized and executed and the cash payment was made
by us to Philips during our fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2004.


Fiscal 2004

Fab

1 Closure and Special Charges

On April 7, 2003, we
announced our intention to close our Chandler, Arizona (Fab
1) wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain Fab
1 personnel and processes into our Tempe, Arizona (Fab
2) wafer fabrication facility.  We
completed this integration process during the three-month period ended June 30,
2003.  The closure of Fab
1 and the integration of certain Fab 1 personnel into
Fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of
207 employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing operations
or provided support to Fab 1.  The detail of the charges incurred related to
the closure of Fab 1 that were included in cost of
sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003 is as follows
(amounts in thousands):

For the quarter ended June 30,
2003, operating expense included $1,612,000 of special charges recorded
principally for contract cancellation, severance and other costs related to the
closure of Fab 1 and other actions.  We incurred $865,000 of such expenditures
during fiscal 2004.  We reversed $747,000
of the special charges recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2003 in the
quarter ended December 31, 2003 as a result of a favorable outcome in the
settlement of a contract cancellation.

The facility where Fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall campus
in Chandler, Arizona.  Within this same
facility resides our wafer probe, mask making and other manufacturing related
activities.  The accelerated depreciation
that was taken only related to assets used in the wafer fabrication operations
at the facility.  We have no specific
plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication
operations, and intend to leave it in an idle status.  The property, plant and equipment that was
subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and
accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property, plant and equipment section of
our balance sheet and related footnote disclosures.

Fiscal 2003

Fab

3 Impairment Charge

We recorded a $41.5
million asset impairment charge during the quarter ended September 30,
2002, as described below.

We acquired Fab 3, a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Puyallup,
Washington, in July 2000.  The
original purchase consisted of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real
property.  It was our intention to bring Fab 3 to productive readiness and commence volume
production of 8-inch wafers using our 0.7 and 0.5 micron process technologies
by August 2001.  We delayed our
production start up at Fab 3 due to deteriorating
business conditions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal 2002.  Fab 3 has never
been brought to productive readiness.

On August 23, 2002,
we acquired Fab 4, a semiconductor manufacturing
facility in Gresham, Oregon.  See Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page F-12, below.  We decided to purchase Fab
4 instead of bringing Fab 3 to productive readiness
because, among other things, the cost of the manufacturing equipment needed to
ramp production at Fab 3 over the next several
years was significantly higher than the total purchase price of Fab 4, and the time to bring Fab
4 to productive readiness was significantly less than the time required to
bring Fab 3 to productive readiness.

After the acquisition of Fab 4 was completed, we undertook an analysis of the
potential production capacity at Fab 4.  The results of the production capacity
analysis led us to determine that Fab 3’s capacity
would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the September 2002
quarter we committed to a plan to sell Fab 3.  At that time, we retained a third-party
broker to market Fab 3 on our behalf.  Accordingly, Fab 3
was classified as an asset held-for-sale as of September 30, 2002 and maintained
that classification until the end of fiscal 2005.

Management determined the
value assigned to the assets through various methods including assistance from
a third-party appraisal.  The independent
third party used the market approach and considered sales of comparable
properties in determining the fair value of Fab
3.  The comparable sales included eight
properties, including our purchases of Fab 3 in July 2000
and Fab 4 in August 2002.  Based on the results of this appraisal, we
recorded an asset impairment charge on Fab 3 of


$36.9 million, including estimated costs to sell.  The remaining value of $60.2 million was
classified as an asset held-for-sale and was included as a component of other
current assets until March 31, 2005.

During the quarter ended September 30,
2002, we also recorded an asset impairment charge of $4.6 million to
write-down certain excess manufacturing equipment located at Fab 3 to its net realizable value of $0.2 million.  This manufacturing equipment became “excess”
as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of Fab 4.  The net
realizable value for the excess manufacturing equipment was determined based on
management estimates.  Substantially all
of the other manufacturing equipment located at Fab 3
has been transferred to and will be used in our other wafer fabrication
facilities located in Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2) and
Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).

At March 31, 2005,
we changed the classification of Fab 3 from an asset
held-for-sale to an asset held-for-future use. 
Fab 3 consists of manufacturing buildings and
land, with no equipment.  Fab 3 had been on the market for over two years, and we had
not received any acceptable offers on the facility.  Over that period of time, our business has
increased significantly and over the next several years we need to begin
planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of Fab 4’s clean room capacity is utilized.  We determined that  the appropriate action to take was to stop
actively marketing the Fab 3 facility and hold it for
our future use.  As a result of this
change in classification, we had to assess the fair value of the Fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment
charge was required upon the change in classification from “held-for-sale” to “held-for-future-use”
under SFAS 144. 
We performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Fab
3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value
estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the asset.  The discounted cash flow analysis confirmed
the carrying value of the Fab 3 asset at March 31,
2005 was not in excess of its fair value. 
We will begin to depreciate the Fab 3 asset in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

PowerSmart

In-Process Research and
Development Charge

During the quarter ended June 30,
2002, purchased in-process research and development of $9.3 million associated
with our acquisition of PowerSmart, Inc. was
written off at the date of the acquisition (June 5, 2002) in accordance
with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability
of FASB Statement No. 2, Business Combinations
Accounted for by the Purchase Method

”

(“FIN 4”).  PowerSmart
delivered a battery management whole product solution that improves system
runtimes with a lower system cost for the user. 
Included in the whole product solution is an application tools suite
designed to speed up implementation during the user’s development and
production.  The acquisition was intended
to strengthen our position in battery management applications such as laptop
computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras
and camcorders.

The assets acquired
included in-process research and development for which there is no alternative
future use.  Management determined the
value assigned to this asset through various methods including assistance from
third party appraisal firms in valuing the PowerSmart
business.  As of the valuation date,
there were 15 projects that were considered to be in process.  The values of the projects were determined
based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by the products that
are expected to result from the in-process projects.  These cash flows were estimated by
forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting
appropriate operating expenses, cash flow adjustments and contributory asset
returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the in-process
technology.  These net returns were
substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the
risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving
commercial readiness.  The above analysis
resulted in $9.3 million of value assigned to acquired in-process research and
development, which was expensed on the acquisition date.  We believe the assumptions used in valuing
in-process research and development are reasonable, but are inherently
uncertain.

Other
Income (Expense)

Interest income in fiscal
2005 increased from interest income in fiscal 2004 as our average invested cash
balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, and we
extended the average maturity term of our invested cash balances and thus
earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances.  Interest income in fiscal 2004 increased from
interest income in fiscal 2003 as our average invested cash balances were at
higher levels in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.

Provision
for Income Taxes

Provisions for income
taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our U.S.
earnings.  Our effective tax rate was 22.9%
in fiscal 2005, 22.8% in fiscal 2004 and, 22.3% in fiscal 2003, and is lower
than statutory rates in the United States due primarily to lower tax rates at
our foreign locations and R&D tax credits.


As part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate
our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  This process involves estimating our actual
current tax exposure, together with assessing temporary differences resulting
from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance
sheet.  We must then assess the
likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable
income within the relevant jurisdiction and, to the extent we believe that
recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.  We have not provided for a valuation
allowance because we believe that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from
future taxable income.  Should we
determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred
tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be
charged to income in the period such determination was made.  At March 31, 2005 our gross deferred tax
asset was $105.1 million.

Various taxing
authorities in the United States and other countries in which we do business
are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by
businesses.  Companies of our size and
complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions
in which they conduct significant operations. 
We are currently under audit by the United States Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) for our fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1999, 2000 and
2001.  As part of this ongoing audit, the
IRS has proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these
returns.  The IRS has issued formal
assessments for these adjustments.  We do
not agree with these adjustments and intend to appeal these assessments.  We believe that we maintain adequate tax
reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon final
resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the appeals
process with the IRS.  We also believe
that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities
that may arise upon other audits in the United States and other countries in
which we do business.  If such amounts
ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves
would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no
longer deemed necessary.  If such amounts
ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to
expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined.

Our Thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit
from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the Thailand
government based on our investments in property, plant and equipment in
Thailand.  Although our tax holidays in
Thailand partially expired in October 2003, our manufacturing operations
in Thailand are being predominantly conducted using equipment that was invested
pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until September 2006.  The expiration of a portion of our tax
holiday in Thailand did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in
fiscal 2004.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”),
enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for a temporary deduction of 85% of dividends
received on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The
deduction would result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the
repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction, the earnings must be
reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan
established by a company’s chief executive officer and approved by the company’s
board of directors. Certain other criteria in the Jobs Act must be satisfied as
well. The maximum amount of our foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary
deduction is $500 million.  The one-year
period for which we are considering the qualifying distribution is fiscal 2006.

We are in the process of evaluating whether we will
repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act,
and if so, the amount that will be repatriated. 
The range of reasonably possible amounts that we are considering for
repatriation, which would be eligible for the temporary deduction, is zero to
$500 million.  We are in the process of
analyzing and evaluating the recently issued regulatory guidance and statutory
technical corrections associated with the Jobs Act to determine the amount, if
any, we will repatriate.  We expect to
determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated, if
any, during fiscal 2006.

We are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a
qualifying repatriation, should we choose to make one, on our income tax
expense for fiscal 2006 or the amount of our indefinitely reinvested foreign
earnings.  If we were to plan to repatriate
the maximum amount eligible for the temporary deduction, which is $500 million,
from foreign earnings which were previously indefinitely reinvested, we
estimate we would incur additional tax expense in fiscal 2006 of between $26.3
million and $28.7 million.

The
foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset
from our future taxable income, the adequacy of our tax reserves to offset any
potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit, the range of possible
repatriation amounts and the estimated amount of additional tax expense are
forward-looking statements.  Actual
results could differ materially because of the following factors, among others:
current and future tax laws and regulations; taxation rates in geographic
regions where we have significant operations; results of any current or future
audit conducted by the


U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing
authorities in the countries in which we do business; and the level of our
taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize our
deferred tax asset.

Change in Accounting Principle

We had
historically recognized revenue from sales to our Americas, European and
multinational Asian distributors at Point of Sale (POS), or when those
distributors sell our products to their customers, and, prior to fiscal 2003,
we recognized revenue on sales to regional Asian distributors at Point of
Purchase (POP), or when we shipped product to these distributors.   Upon shipment, amounts billed to distributors
at POS are included as accounts receivable, inventory is relieved, the sale is
deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the
product is sold by the distributor to its customers.

On March 18,
2003, we announced that we would change our revenue recognition policy relating
to regional Asian distributors from POP to POS.   We believe that revenue recognition at POS
for sales to distributors as our sole revenue recognition policy worldwide is a
more reflective measure of end customer demand for our products.  To implement the change in revenue
recognition, we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle of $11.4 million (net of income taxes of $6.6 million) as of April 1,
2002, the beginning of fiscal 2003.  The
cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was calculated by
multiplying the quantity of our inventory that the regional Asia distributors
maintained as of April 1, 2002 by the gross margin we would realize on
those sales, net of related income tax.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We had $734.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments at March 31, 2005, an increase of $260.1 million
from the March 31, 2004 balance.  The
increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments over this time
period is primarily attributable to our cash flows generated from operations.

During fiscal 2005, we
maintained an unsecured short-term line of credit with various financial
institutions in Asia, which at March 31, 2005 totaled $5 million (U.S. dollar
equivalent).  There were no borrowings
under the foreign line of credit as of March 31, 2005, but an allocation
of approximately $0.4 million of the available line was made, relating to
import guarantees associated with our business in Thailand.  There are no covenants related to the foreign
line of credit.

Net cash provided from
operating activities was $352.7 million for fiscal 2005, $343.1 million for
fiscal 2004 and $260.2 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in cash flow from
operations was primarily due to increases in net income.

Net cash used in
investing activities was $370.7 million for fiscal 2005, $267.6 million for
fiscal 2004 and $376.8 million in fiscal 2003. 
The increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 over
fiscal 2004 was due to changes in our net purchases, sales and maturities of
short-term investments.  The decrease in
cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was primarily
due to the purchases of Fab 4 and PowerSmart
that occurred in fiscal 2003.

We enter into hedging
transactions from time to time in an attempt to minimize our exposure to
currency rate fluctuations.  Although
none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had
a highly inflationary economy in the last five years, there is no assurance
that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries
where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in
the future.  There were no hedges
outstanding as of March 31, 2005.

Our level of capital
expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated
business conditions.  Capital
expenditures were $63.2

million in
fiscal 2005, $63.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $265.1 million in fiscal
2003.  The primary reason for the dollar
decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was a
reduced need for additional capital equipment as a result of our purchase of Fab 4 during fiscal 2003. 
We currently intend to spend approximately $55 to $60 million during the
next 12 months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain, and
selectively increase, capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs.

We expect to finance
capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from
operations.  We believe that the capital
expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide
sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs.

Net cash used in
financing activities was $18.6

million for
fiscal 2005, $24.0 million for fiscal 2004 and $3.1 million for fiscal
2003.  Proceeds from the sale of stock,
the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock
purchase plan were $47.2 million for fiscal 2005, $53.2 million for fiscal 2004
and $31.5 million for fiscal 2003.  Cash


expended for the repurchase of our common stock was $68.3 million in
fiscal 2005, $53.9 million in fiscal 2004 and $26.5 million in fiscal 2003.  We had short-term borrowings of $45.5 million
at March 31, 2005.  The short-term
debt is a result of repurchase agreements that are in place with two investment
firms.

On March 11, 2004,
our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 2,500,000 shares of our
common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As of March 31, 2005, we had repurchased
the entire 2,500,000 common shares under this authorization for a total of
$66.1 million.  On April 22, 2004,
our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
2,500,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions.  As of March 31,
2005, we had repurchased 884,900 common shares under this authorization for a
total of $23.3 million.  As of March 31,
2005, all but 818,332 of the purchased shares under both authorizations had
been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee
stock purchase plan.  The timing and
amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and
corporate considerations.

On October 28, 2002,
we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a
quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. 
The initial quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share was paid on December 6,
2003 in the amount of $4.0 million. 
We have continued to pay quarterly dividends and have increased the
amount of such dividends on a regular basis. 
During fiscal 2004, we paid dividends in the amount of $0.113

per share for a total dividend payment of $23.3
million.  During fiscal 2005, we paid
dividends in the amount of $0.208 per share for a total dividend payment of
$43.0 million.  On April 27, 2005,
we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.095 per share, which will be paid
on June 3, 2005 to stockholders of record on May 13, 2005 and is
estimated to be $19.8 million.  Our Board
is free to change its dividend practices at any time and to decrease or
increase the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend, on our common stock on
the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements
and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  Our current intent is to provide for ongoing
quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of
operations.

We believe that our
existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will
be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least
the next 12 months.  However, the
semiconductor industry is capital intensive. 
In order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to
make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and
research and development.  We may seek
additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our
wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, or for other
purposes.  The timing and amount of any
such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including
demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, and
competitive factors.  There can be no
assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, and any
additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to
our existing stockholders.

The
foregoing statements regarding our anticipated level of capital expenditures
over the next 12 months, the nature of such expenditures, the financing and
sufficiency of our capital expenditures and our belief that existing sources of
liquidity will be sufficient to meet our requirements are forward-looking
statements.  Actual results could differ
materially because of the following factors, among others: changes in demand
for our products and those of our customers; changes in utilization of current
manufacturing capacity; unanticipated costs in continuing to ramp production at
Fab 4; market acceptance of our products and of our
customers’ products; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the
markets addressed by our products; the availability and cost of raw materials,
equipment and other supplies; actual levels of capital expenditures; the costs
and outcome of any tax audit or any litigation involving intellectual property,
customer or other issues; the financial condition of our customers and vendors;
uninsured losses; and the economic, political and other conditions in the
worldwide markets served by us.

Contractual Obligations

The following
table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March 31,
2005, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and
cash flows in future periods.  This table
excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities
at March 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands):


(1)

Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or
purchases of property, plant and equipment. 
They are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31,
2005, as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the
property.

(2)

Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under
various types of licenses.

(3)

Total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations
recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, or certain purchase
obligations as discussed below.

Purchase orders or
contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are
not included in the table above.  We are
not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that
represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent
authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  For the purpose of this table, contractual
obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that
are enforceable and legally binding on Microchip and that specify all
significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased;
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the
transaction.  Our purchase orders are
based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with
short time horizons.  We do not have
significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods
specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected
requirements for three months.  We also
enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under
these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain
clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.

The expected
timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on
current information.  Timing of payments
and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of
goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of March 31,
2005, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 3(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

During December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R
which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all
share-based payments at fair value. 
Share-based payments include stock option grants.  We grant options to purchase common stock to
some of our employees and directors under our stock option plan at prices equal
to the market value of the stock on the dates the options were granted.  SFAS No. 123R
is effective for us beginning April 1, 2006.  Early adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 123R is encouraged, but not required.  We have not yet adopted this pronouncement
and are currently evaluating the expected impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on our consolidated financial
position and results of operations.  We
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have an
unfavorable impact on our consolidated results of operations and net income per
common share.  SFAS
No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather
than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature.  This requirement will reduce net operating
cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after
adoption.  We cannot estimate what those
amounts will be in the future because they depend on, among other things, when
employees exercise stock options.


FASB

Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 109-2, “Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”),
provides guidance under FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” (“SFAS 109”) with respect to
recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Creation Act”) on enterprises’ income tax
expense and deferred tax liability.  The
Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004.  FSP 109-2 states
that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of
enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment
or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109.  As of March 31,
2005, we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate any
foreign earnings under the Act and, if so, the amount that we will repatriate.  However, we do not expect to be able to
complete this evaluation until later in fiscal 2006.  Accordingly, as provided for in FSP 109-2, we have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred
tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Creation
Act.  The Jobs Creation Act also provides
a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, to be
phased in from 2005 through 2010, which is intended to replace the existing
extra-territorial income exclusion for foreign sales. In FSP
109-1, the FASB decided the deduction for qualified
domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under
SFAS 109, rather than as a rate reduction.  Accordingly, any benefit from the deduction
will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax
return and no adjustment to deferred taxes at March 31, 2005 is required.

In March 2004, the FASB
approved the consensus reached on the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF 03-1”).  The
Issue’s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other-than-temporarily
impaired investments.  EITF 03-1 also provides new disclosure requirements for
investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired.  In September 2004, the FASB issued a FSP  EITF 03-1-1 that delays the effective date of the
measurement and recognition guidance in EITF 03-1
until further notice.  The disclosure
requirements of EITF 03-1 are effective with this
annual report for fiscal 2005.  Once the FASB reaches a final decision on the measurement and
recognition provisions, we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the
accounting provisions of EITF 03-1.

In December 2004, the FASB
also issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” (“SFAS 151”) which will become effective for us beginning January 1,
2006.  This standard clarifies that
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead.  In addition, this standard requires that the
allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities.  We are currently evaluating the potential
impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations,
but do not believe the impact of the change will be material.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our investment portfolio,
consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an available-for-sale
basis, was $728.7 million as of March 31, 2005, and $462.9 million as
of March 31, 2004.  These
securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate
risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase.  We have the ability to hold our fixed income
investments until maturity and, therefore, we would not expect to recognize any
material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates
increase.  The following table provides
information about our available-for-sale securities that are sensitive to changes
in interest rates.  We have aggregated
our available-for-sale securities for presentation purposes since they are all
very similar in nature (dollars in thousands):

We have international
operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations.  To date, our exposure related to exchange
rate volatility has not been significant. 
Approximately 99% of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.  At times we maintain hedges of foreign
currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.  There were no hedges outstanding as of March 31,
2005.  The amounts of the hedges
outstanding as of March 31, 2004 were immaterial.  If foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15% from
the rates at March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, the effect on our
financial position and results of operation would not be material.


During the normal course
of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks, examples
of which include, but are not limited to, interest rate movements and foreign
currency fluctuations, as we discuss in this Item 7A, and collectability
of accounts receivable.  We continuously
assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect
against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures.  Although we do not anticipate any material
losses in these risk areas, no assurance can be made that material losses will
not be incurred in these areas in the future.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.

As of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as required by
paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we evaluated under the supervision of our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or
15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on
this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management. Our disclosure controls and
procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
will be met.

Management Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Management assessed our internal
control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, the end of our
fiscal year.  Management based its
assessment on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.  Management’s assessment
included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness
of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting
policies, and our overall control environment. 
This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our finance
organization.


Based on our assessment,
management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  We reviewed
the results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors.

Our independent
registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
who also audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, audited
management’s assessment and independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting.  Ernst &
Young LLP has issued their attestation report, which
is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting.

During the three months
ended March 31, 2005, there was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by
paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of
Directors and Stockholders of Microchip Technology Incorporated and
subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Microchip Technology Incorporated and subsidiaries as of March 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Microchip Technology Incorporated and subsidiaries at March 31,
2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2005, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Microchip Technology Incorporated’s internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 17, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
COSO criteria). Microchip Technology Incorporated’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Microchip
Technology Incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Microchip
Technology Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on
the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the March 31,
2005 consolidated financial statements of Microchip Technology Incorporated and
our report dated May 17,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of
Business

Microchip
develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products used by its
customers for a wide variety of embedded control applications.  Microchip’s product portfolio comprises the PICmicro

®

field-programmable
(FLASH) RISC microcontrollers, which serve 8-bit and 16-bit embedded control
applications, and a broad spectrum of high-performance linear and mixed-signal,
power management and thermal management devices.  Microchip also offers complementary
microperipheral products including interface devices, Serial EEPROMs, and
application-specific standard products (ASSPs). 
This synergistic product portfolio targets thousands of applications and
a growing demand for high-performance designs in the automotive,
communications, computing, consumer and industrial control markets.

Principles
of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microchip Technology Incorporated and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Microchip” or the “Company”).  The Company does not have any subsidiaries in
which it does not own 100% of the outstanding stock.  All of the Company’s subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements.  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Change in
Accounting Principle

On March 18, 2003, the Company announced that it would
change its revenue recognition policy relating to regional Asian distributors
from Point of Purchase (POP), or when the Company ships product to these distributors,
to Point of Sale (POS), or when those distributors sell the Company’s products
to their customers.  The change in
accounting principle is preferable because: (i) it better reflects the
substance of end customer demand for the Company’s products, and will better
focus the Company on, and allow investors to better understand, end user demand
trends for its products; (ii) it provides uniformity in the revenue
recognition policy of the Company; and (iii) the new accounting method is
consistent with other companies in the semiconductor industry and, therefore,
provides greater comparability in the presentation of financial results among
the Company and its peers.  To implement
the change in revenue recognition, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle charge of $11.4 million (net of income taxes of
$6.6 million) as of April 1, 2002.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced
by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title as well as fixed pricing
and probable collectability.  The Company
recognizes revenue from product sales to OEMs upon shipment and records
reserves for estimated customer returns. 
Distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product
return rights, so the Company defers revenue recognition until the distributor
sells the product to their customer.  The
Company reduces product pricing through price protection based on market
conditions, competitive considerations and other factors.  Price protection is granted to third-party
distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price
protection is offered.  When the Company
reduces the price of its products, it allows the distributor to claim a credit
against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of
the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction.  There is no revenue impact from the price
protections.  The Company also grants
certain credits to its third-party distributors.  The credits are granted to the distributors
on specially identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to
earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of the Company’s products to their
end customers.  The credits are on a per
unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information
regarding the sale to their end customer. 
The effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price
from the Company to its distributors for the product and results in the net
revenue recognized by the Company when the product is sold by the distributors
to their end customers.  Upon shipment,
amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable, inventory
is relieved, the sale and the gross margin are deferred and reflected as a
current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to its customers.  Shipping charges billed to customers are
included in net sales, and the related shipping costs are included in cost of
sales.

F-7

Product Warranty

The
Company generally sells products with a limited warranty related to product
quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual
property infringement claims related to the Company’s products.  Due to comprehensive product testing, the
short time between product shipment and the detection and correction of product
failures, and a low historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the
accrual based on historical activity and the related expense were not
significant as of and for the fiscal years presented.

Advertising
Costs

The
Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred.  Advertising costs were not material in the
years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Research
and Development

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
Research and development expenses include expenditures for labor, masks,
prototype wafers, and expenses for development of process technologies, new
packages, and software to support new products and design environments.

Foreign
Currency Translation and Forward Contracts

The Company’s foreign subsidiaries are considered to be
extensions of the U.S. Company and any translation gains and losses related to
these subsidiaries are included in other income and expense.  As the U.S. dollar is utilized as the
functional currency, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the
subsidiaries’ functional currency) are also included in income.  Gains and losses associated with currency
rate changes on forward contracts are recorded currently in income.  These gains and losses have historically been
immaterial to the Company’s financial statements.

Income
Taxes

As
part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, the
Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which it operates.  This process
involves estimating the Company’s actual current tax exposure together with assessing
temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and
accounting purposes.  These differences
result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet. 
The Company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets
will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that
recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance.  The Company has not provided for a valuation
allowance because management currently believes that it is “more likely than
not” that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments, including marketable
securities purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less when
acquired are considered to be cash equivalents.

Short-Term Investments

The
Company’s investments are classified as available-for-sale. The Company defines
short-term investments as income yielding securities, which can be readily
converted to cash. Short-term investments consist of government agency bonds,
municipal bonds, corporate preferred stock, state student loan bonds and fixed
rate annuity contracts.  These
investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported
in stockholders’ equity.  Realized gains
and losses are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is
based upon the specific identification method.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments, which
is included in bad debt expense.  The
Company determines the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the
composition of its accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer
receivables, considering such customer’s financial condition, credit history
and current economic conditions.

Inventories

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.  The Company writes down its
inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount
equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market
value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by the Company, additional

F-8

inventory
write-downs may be required.  Inventory
impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not
subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that
increased carrying amounts are recoverable. 
In estimating reserves for obsolescence, the Company primarily evaluates
estimates of demand over a 12-month period and provides reserves for inventory
on hand in excess of the estimated 12-month demand.

Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized,
while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.  The Company’s property and equipment
accounting policies incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments relative
to the useful lives of its property and equipment.  Depreciation is provided for assets placed in
service on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
relative assets, which range from 3 to 30 years.  The Company evaluates the carrying value of
its property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired.  Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature,
highly subjective.

Litigation

The
Company’s estimated range of liability related to certain pending litigation is
based on claims for which management believes a loss is probable and it can
estimate the amount or range of loss. 
Because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of the
loss on the remaining pending litigation, the Company is unable to make a
reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable
outcome.  As additional information
becomes available, the Company will assess the potential liability related to
its pending litigation and revise its estimates, if necessary.

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition
exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible
assets acquired.  The Company is required
to perform an annual impairment review, and more frequently under certain circumstances.  The goodwill is subjected to this test during
the fourth quarter of the Company’s fiscal year.  The Company engages primarily in the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products and, as a
result, the Company concluded there is one reporting unit.  The impairment review process compares the
fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the Company determines through the
impairment process that goodwill has been impaired, the Company will record the
impairment charge in the statement of income. 
As of March 31, 2005, there was no impairment charge related to
goodwill.  There can be no assurance that
future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses whether indicators of impairment of
long-lived assets are present.  If such
indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated
undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than
their carrying value.  If less, the
Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying
amount of the assets over their respective fair values.  Fair value is determined by discounted future
cash flows, appraisals or other methods. 
If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, the
Company recognizes an impairment loss through a charge to operating results to
the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the
asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. 
The Company would depreciate the remaining value over the remaining
estimated useful life of the asset.

Share-Based
Payment

The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of
shares to certain employees and directors with an exercise price equal to the
fair market value of the shares at the date of grant.  The Company accounts for stock option grants
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees” and related Interpretations, and, accordingly,
recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants.

The following table represents the effect on net income
and earnings per share (shown in thousands, except for per share amounts) if
the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition provisions
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to share-based
employee and director compensation.  For
purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the options is estimated
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and amortized ratably to expense
over the options’ vesting periods. 
Because the estimated value is determined as of the date of grant, the
actual value ultimately realized by the employee may be significantly
different.

F-9

See
Note 17 for further discussion of the Company’s equity incentive plan.

At a
meeting held on February 17, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors and the Board of Directors of the Company approved the
acceleration of the vesting of certain Company stock options with an option
price of $27.153 per share or greater. 
The purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to
avoid recognizing in its income statement compensation expense associated with
these options in future periods, upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R
(Share-Based Payment) in April 2006. 
The pre-tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately $13.7 million and
represents the fair of the unvested awards as of the date of the acceleration
as determined under SFAS No. 123.  This
amount would otherwise have been required to be recognized as compensation
expense over the vesting period upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R.  As a result of the accelerated vesting,
approximately 2.3 million option shares or 25.4% of the total number of the outstanding
unvested option shares with varying remaining vesting schedules became
immediately exercisable.  In order to
help avoid unintended personal benefits to the holders of the accelerated
options, any shares received through the exercise of accelerated options may
not be sold by the option holder until the first to occur of the original
vesting date of the accelerated option or the termination of the employment of
the option holder.  In connection with
the accelerated vesting, each option agreement underlying such options was
amended.  As of the date of the
acceleration, the fair market value of the Company’s common stock was below the
option price of the accelerated options in all material respects, so no APB 25
charges were incurred and future potential charges are immaterial.

Concentrations of Credit
Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of investments in debt securities and trade
receivables.  The Company generally
places its investments with high-credit quality counterparties.  Investments in debt securities with original
maturities of greater than six months consist primarily of AAA rated financial
instruments and counterparties.  The
Company’s investments are primarily in direct obligations of the United States
government or its agencies.

Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally not
significant due to the diversity of the Company’s customers and geographic
sales areas.  The Company sells its
products primarily to OEMs and distributors in the Americas, Europe and
Asia.  The company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and requires
collateral, primarily letters of credit, as deemed necessary.  No single end customer accounted for 10% or
more of the Company’s net sales or accounts receivable balances during the
years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 
The Company had two distributors that accounted for more than 10% of its
net sales in the year ended March 31, 2005.  See Note 19, Geographic Information, for
additional information on the Company’s largest distributors.

F-10

Use of
Estimates

The Company has made a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
to prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

During
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, which requires
companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based
payments at fair value.  Share-based
payments include stock option grants.  The
Company grants options to purchase common stock to some of our employees and
directors under our stock option plan at prices equal to the market value of
the stock on the dates the options were granted.  SFAS No. 123R is effective for the
Company beginning April 1, 2006. 
Early adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 123R is encouraged,
but not required.  The Company has not
yet adopted this pronouncement and is currently evaluating the expected impact
that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on our consolidated financial
position and results of operations.  The
adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have an unfavorable impact on the
consolidated results of operations and net income per common share.  SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under
current literature.  This requirement
will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in
periods after adoption.  The Company
cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend
on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options.

FASB
Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”), provides guidance under FASB Statement No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” (“SFAS No. 109”) with respect to recording
the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Creation Act”) on enterprises’ income tax
expense and deferred tax liability.  The
Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004.  FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed
time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect
of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign
earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109.  As of March 31, 2005, the Company is in
the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings and,
if so, the amount that it will repatriate.  However, the Company does not expect to be
able to complete this evaluation until later in fiscal 2006. Accordingly, as
provided for in FSP 109-2, the Company has not adjusted our tax expense or
deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs
Creation Act.  The Jobs Creation Act also
provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities,
to be phased in from 2005 through 2010, which is intended to replace the
existing extra-territorial income exclusion for foreign sales. In FSP 109-1,
the FASB decided the deduction for qualified domestic production activities
should be accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No. 109, rather
than as a rate reduction.  Accordingly,
any benefit from the deduction will be reported in the period in which the
deduction is claimed on the tax return and no adjustment to deferred taxes at March 31,
2005, is required.

In March 2004, the
FASB approved the consensus reached on the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF 03-1”).  The Issue’s objective is to provide guidance
for identifying other-than-temporarily impaired investments. EITF 03-1 also
provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be
temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-1-1
that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in
EITF 03-1 until further notice.  The
disclosure requirements of EITF 03-1 are effective with this annual report for
fiscal 2005.  Once the FASB reaches a
final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions, the Company will
evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1.

In December 2004,
the FASB also issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4,” which will become effective for the Company beginning January 1,
2006.  This standard clarifies that
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead.  In addition, this standard requires that the
allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities.  The Company is currently evaluating the
potential impact of this standard on its financial position and results of
operations, but does not believe the impact of the change will be material.

ACQUISITION
OF GRESHAM, OREGON WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY

On August 23,
2002, the Company completed its acquisition of a semiconductor manufacturing
complex in Gresham, Oregon.  The Company
acquired the facility for $183.5 million in cash plus direct acquisition costs
of approximately $1.2 million.  The
facility is situated on an approximately 140-acre campus east of Portland and
comprises approximately 826,500 square feet. 
The facility came equipped with approximately 350 process tools and 170
support tools.  The Company is currently
producing 8-inch wafers on its 0.5 micron process technology at the Gresham
facility.  The facility also houses
offices, meeting rooms and support functions. 
The Company began production activities on October 31, 2003 at this
facility.  As of March 31, 2005, all
of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as
the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service.  All manufacturing equipment that was not
being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process since
the Company believes there is no change to their utility from the present time
until they are placed into productive service. 
The lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at this facility
will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service.  The temporary idling of such assets has not
impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets.

ACQUISITION
OF POWERSMART, INC.

On June 5, 2002, the Company completed the
acquisition of PowerSmart, Inc. in which the Company acquired all of
PowerSmart’s outstanding capital stock and assumed certain stock options for
consideration of $54.0 million in cash plus other acquisition-related costs of
$1.2 million.  The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations,

and accordingly,
the results of PowerSmart’s operations are included in the Company’s
consolidated results from the date of the acquisition.  The acquisition was not considered
significant under the rules and regulations of the SEC (Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X).

The purchase price was allocated among PowerSmart’s
tangible and intangible assets, in-process research and development and
goodwill.  Management determined the
value assigned to the assets acquired through various methods including
assistance from a third-party appraisal. 
An allocation of $9.3 million of the purchase price was assigned to
in-process research and development and was written off at the date of the
acquisition.  The amount paid in excess
of the fair value of the net tangible assets has been allocated to separately
identifiable intangible assets based upon an independent valuation analysis.  An allocation of $5.6 million of the purchase
price was made to core technology and other identifiable intangible assets and
is being amortized over an estimated useful life of seven years.  An allocation of approximately $32.3 million
of the purchase price was made to goodwill. 
None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.  The goodwill related to the PowerSmart
acquisition was reduced by $0.4 million to $31.9 million in the year ended March 31,
2005 due to a favorable settlement of a liability that was recorded as of the
original acquisition date.

The Company records acquisition-related purchase
consideration as unearned stock-based compensation.  During the year ended March 31, 2003,
the Company recorded unearned stock-based compensation of $130,000.  The unearned stock-based compensation
includes the intrinsic value of stock options assumed in connection with the
acquisition of PowerSmart that is earned as the employees provide future
services.  The compensation is being
recognized over the period earned, and the expense is included in the
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs.  Amortization of unearned stock compensation was
$16,000 in fiscal 2005, $46,000 in fiscal 2004 and $59,000 in fiscal 2003.

The acquisition was intended to strengthen the Company’s
position in battery management applications such as laptop computers, personal
digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras and camcorders.

SPECIAL
CHARGES

The
components of special charges are (in thousands):

Fiscal 2005

Settlement with U.S. Philips
Corporation

The Company reached an agreement with U.S. Philips
Corporation and Philips Electronics North America Corp. (together “Philips”)
regarding patent license litigation with Philips which was ongoing from October 2001
to October 2004.  The agreement
included dismissal of the then pending litigation and the cross-license of certain
patents between Philips and the Company. 
The Company recorded a special charge of $21.1 million in the quarter
that ended June 30, 2004 associated with this matter.  Pursuant to this cross-license, the Company
licensed certain of its patents related to 8-pin microcontrollers to Philips,
and Philips licensed its patents related to I


C
serial communications to the Company, each on fully-paid up, non-royalty
bearing worldwide licenses.  The Company
finalized and executed the definitive settlement agreement related to this
matter and made the cash payment to Philips during the fiscal quarter ending September 30,
2004.

Fiscal 2004

Closure of Fab 1

On April 7, 2003, the Company announced its
intention to close its Chandler, Arizona (Fab 1) wafer fabrication facility and
integrate certain Fab 1 personnel and processes into its Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2)
wafer fabrication facility.  The Company
completed this integration process during the three-month period ended June 30,
2003.  The closure of Fab 1 and the integration
of certain Fab 1 personnel into Fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in
force of 207 employees who were either directly involved in the Company’s
manufacturing operations or provided support functions to Fab 1.  The detail of the charges incurred related to
the closure of Fab 1 that were included in cost of sales for the
three-month period ended June 30, 2003 is as follows (amounts in
thousands):

Accelerated depreciation for Fab 1

$

30,608

Fab 1 related charges including severance, material
  and other costs

1,147

Total charges in cost of sales

$

31,755

The facility where Fab 1 was located is an integral part of
the Company’s overall campus in Chandler, Arizona.  Within this same facility resides the Company’s
wafer probe, mask making and other manufacturing related activities.  Consequently it is not possible to abandon or
otherwise dispose of this facility.  The
accelerated depreciation that was taken only related to assets used in the
wafer fabrication operations at the facility. 
The Company has no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly
housing the wafer fabrication operations, and intends to leave it in an idle
state.  The property, plant and equipment
that was subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and
accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property, plant and equipment section of
the Company’s balance sheet and related footnote disclosures.

The Company incurred $865,000 of special charges recorded
principally for contract cancellation, severance and other costs related to the
closure of Fab 1 and other actions.

F-13

Fiscal 2003

Fab 3
Impairment Charge

The
Company recorded a $41.5 million asset impairment charge during the quarter ended
September 30, 2002, as described below.

The
Company acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Puyallup,
Washington, referred to as Fab 3, in July 2000.  The original purchase consisted of
semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real property.  It was the Company’s intention to bring Fab 3
to productive readiness and commence volume production of 8-inch wafers using
its 0.7 and 0.5 micron process technologies by August 2001.  The Company delayed its intended production
start up at Fab 3 due to deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor
industry during fiscal 2002.  Fab 3 has
never been brought to productive readiness.

As is
described in Note 2, in August 2002 the Company acquired a semiconductor
manufacturing facility in Gresham, Oregon, referred to as Fab 4.  After the acquisition of Fab 4 was completed,
the Company undertook an analysis of the potential production capacity at Fab
4.  The results of the production
capacity analysis at that time led the Company to determine that Fab 3’s
capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the second
quarter of fiscal 2003 the Company committed to a plan to sell Fab 3.  The Company subsequently retained a
third-party broker to market Fab 3 on its behalf and began actively seeking
potential buyers.  Accordingly, Fab 3 was
classified as an asset held-for-sale as of September 30, 2002 and
maintained that classification until March 31, 2005.

Management
determined the value assigned to the Fab 3 assets through various methods
including assistance from a third-party appraisal.  The independent third party used the market
approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair
value of Fab 3.  The comparable sales
included eight properties, including the Company’s purchases of Fab 3 in July 2000
and Fab 4 in August 2002.  Based on
the results of this appraisal, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge
on Fab 3 of $36.9 million, including estimated costs to sell.  The remaining value of $60.2 million was
classified as an asset held-for-sale and was included as a component of other
current assets until March 31, 2005.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company recorded an asset
impairment charge of $4.6 million to write-down certain excess manufacturing
equipment located at Fab 3 to its net realizable value of $0.2 million.  This manufacturing equipment became “excess”
as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of Fab 4.  The net realizable value for the excess
manufacturing equipment was determined based on management estimates.  Substantially all of the other manufacturing
equipment located at Fab 3 has been transferred to and will be used in the
Company’s other wafer fabrication facilities located in Tempe, Arizona (Fab 2)
and Gresham, Oregon (Fab 4).

At March 31,
2005, the Company changed the classification of Fab 3 from an asset
held-for-sale to an asset held-for-future-use. 
Fab 3 had been on the market for over two years, and the Company had not
received any acceptable offers on the facility. 
Over that period of time, the Company’s business had increased
significantly and over the next several years the Company will need to begin
planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of Fab 4’s
clean room capacity is utilized.  The
Company determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively
marketing the Fab 3 facility and hold it for its future use.  As a result of this change in classification,
the Company had to assess the fair value of the Fab 3 asset to determine if any
additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification
from “held-for-sale” to “held-for-future-use” under SFAS 144.  The Company performed a discounted cash flow
analysis of the Fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in
developing the fair value estimate given that it was the best available
valuation technique for the asset.  The
discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of the Fab 3 asset
at March 31, 2005 was not in excess of its fair value.  The Company will begin to depreciate the Fab
3 asset in April 2005.

SHORT-TERM
INVESTMENTS

The Company’s short-term investments are intended to
establish a high-quality portfolio that preserves principal, meets liquidity
needs, avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in
relationship to the Company’s investment guidelines and market conditions.
Short-term investments consist of corporate and various government agency and
municipal debt securities.  Management
classifies the Company’s short-term investments as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’
equity.  Realized gains and losses and
declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, are included in
operations.  A decline in the market
value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other
than temporary, results in an impairment in the fair value of the
investment.  The impairment is charged to
earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established.  Premiums and discounts are amortized or
accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security.  Dividend and interest income are recognized
when earned.  The cost of security sold
is calculated using the specific identification method.  The following is a summary of
available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2005 (amounts in thousands):

The
following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2004
(amounts in thousands):

The
Company’s unrealized losses of $11.6 million were due to fluctuations in
interest rates.  Management does not
believe any of the unrealized losses represented an other-than-temporary
impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of March 31,
2005.

During
the year ended March 31, 2005, the Company did not have any gross realized
gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale securities.  During the year ended March 31, 2004,
the Company had a gross realized gain of $8,000 on sales of available-for-sale
securities.

The
amortized cost and estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities at
March 31, 2005, by maturity, are shown below (amounts in thousands).  Expected maturities can differ from
contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right
to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties, and the Company views its
available-for-sale securities as available for current operations.

Property,
plant and equipment consists of the following (amounts in thousands):

Property,
plant and equipment at March 31, 2005 includes $12.1 million in land and
$48.1 million in buildings and building improvements related to Fab 3.  These assets were included in other current
assets at March 31, 2004 since they were classified as assets
held-for-sale prior to the Company’s recent decision to retain them for future
use (see Note 4).

Depreciation
and amortization expense attributed to property, plant and equipment was $119.0
million, $109.8 million and $109.6 million for the years ending March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  In
addition to depreciation and amortization expense, accelerated depreciation
charges of $30.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2004, related to the
Company’s Fab 1 shutdown, are included in cost of sales.

SHORT-TERM
DEBT

The Company had
short-term debt of $45.5 million as of March 31, 2005.  The short-term debt is a result of repurchase
agreements that are in place with two of the Company’s investment
brokerages.  The short-term debt is
collateralized with $47.5 million of the Company’s short-term investments.  The short-term debt had a weighted average
interest rate of 2.71% as of March 31, 2005.  The Company used these borrowings to fund the
activity under its stock repurchase programs beginning in the second quarter of
the year ended March 31, 2005.

The Company has an
unsecured line of credit with a financial institution in Asia for up to $5.0
million (U.S. dollar equivalent).  There
were no borrowings against this line of credit as of March 31, 2005, but
an allocation of $0.4 million of the available line was made, relating to
import guarantees associated with the Company’s business in Thailand.  There are no covenants associated with the
foreign line of credit.  The foreign line
of credit is due to expire in July 2005.

INCOME
TAXES

The provision for income taxes is as follows (amounts

F-18

The tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee
stock options reduced taxes currently payable by $15.3 million, $37.6
million and $18.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.  These amounts were
credited to additional paid-in capital in each of the three fiscal years.

The provision for
income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal
tax rate to income before income taxes. 
The sources and tax effects of the differences in the total income tax
provision for income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Pretax income from
foreign operations was $199.0 million, $136.3 million and $108.2 million for
the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Unremitted foreign earnings that are
considered to be permanently invested outside the United States, and on which
no deferred taxes have been provided, amounted to approximately $766.0 million
at March 31, 2005.  Should the
Company elect in the future to repatriate a portion of the foreign earnings so
invested, the Company would incur income tax expense on such repatriation, net
of any available deductions and foreign tax credits.  This would result in additional income tax
expense beyond the computed expected provision in such periods.

In December 2004,
the FASB issued Financial Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (FSP 109-2).  On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was signed into law.  The Act creates a temporary incentive for
U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by including
an 85 percent deduction for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as
defined in the Act, at an effective tax cost of 5.25 percent.  FSP 109-2 is effective immediately and
provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision.  FSP 109-2 allows companies additional time to
evaluate the effects of the law on its unremitted earnings for the purpose of
applying the “indefinite reversal criteria” under APB 23, “Accounting for
Income Taxes – Special Areas,” and requires explanatory disclosures from
companies that have not yet completed the evaluation.

F-19

The Company is in
the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings under
the Act and, if so, the amount that it will repatriate.  However, the Company does not expect to be
able to complete this evaluation until later in fiscal 2006.  Based on our preliminary analysis, the range
of possible amounts that the Company is considering for repatriation under this
provision is between zero and $500 million. 
The related potential range of income tax is between zero and
approximately $28.7 million.  The Company
expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be
repatriated, if any, during fiscal year 2006.

The tax effects of
temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (amounts in thousands):

The Fab 3 asset changed classifications from an asset
held-for-sale at March 31, 2004 to an asset held-for-future-use at March 31,
2005.  At March 31, 2005, any tax
effects of temporary differences related to Fab 3 are included in the deferred
tax liability related to depreciation on property, plant and equipment.

Management believes that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income such that it is “more likely than not”
that deferred tax assets will be realized.

On June 5, 2002, the Company acquired
all of the outstanding stock of PowerSmart Inc. in a taxable stock
acquisition.  As a result of the
PowerSmart acquisition, $6.7 million of net deferred tax assets were acquired
consisting of a deferred tax asset of $8.8 million relating primarily to net
operating loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability of $2.1 million
relating to intangible assets acquired.

At March 31, 2005, the Company had a net operating loss
carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $15.4 million, which
begins to expire in varying amounts in the years 2018

through
2022.  The net operating loss
carryforward is attributable to the acquisition of PowerSmart.  An analysis of the annual limitation on the
utilization of the PowerSmart net operating losses was performed in accordance
with Internal Revenue Code Section 382. 
It was determined that Section 382 will not limit the use of the
PowerSmart net operating losses in full over the carryover period.

At March 31, 2005, the Company had recorded credit carryforwards
of approximately $19.7 million for foreign tax credits, $22.9 million for
research and development credits, and $4.7 million for alternative minimum tax
credits.

F-20

The foreign tax credits begin to expire in varying amounts
in the years ending March 31, 2006 through March 31, 2010, the
research and development credits begin to expire in varying amounts in the
years ending March 31, 2011 through March 31, 2025 and the
alternative minimum tax credits have no expiration date.  The Company believes that all of its credit
carryforwards will be utilized in future periods.

The Company’s Thailand manufacturing
operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays granted to the Company
based on its investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand.  Although the Company’s tax holidays in
Thailand partially expired in October 2003, the Company’s manufacturing
operations in Thailand are being conducted using primarily equipment that was
invested pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until September 2006.  The aggregate dollar benefits derived from
these tax holidays approximated $11.5 million, $45.3 million and $31.4
million for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The benefit the tax holiday had on net income
per share approximated $0.05, $0.21 and $0.15 for the years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The
reduction in the benefits derived from the Company’s tax holiday in Thailand in
the year ended March 31, 2005 compared to the year ended March 31,
2004 was a result of changes in the Company’s overall international tax
structure.  These changes did not have a
material impact on the Company’s overall effective tax rate.

The Company is currently under audit by
the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for its fiscal years ended March 31,
1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.  The IRS has
proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these tax
returns.  The IRS has issued formal assessments
for these adjustments.  The Company does
not agree with these adjustments and intends to appeal these assessments.  The Company believes that it maintains
adequate tax reserves to offset the potential liabilities that may arise upon final
resolution of the audit through either settlement or the appeals process with
the IRS.  If such amounts ultimately
prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves would result
in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
necessary.  If such amounts ultimately
prove to be less than the ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would
result.  The Company has included in
income taxes payable reserves for potential losses.  Should such losses occur, they would result
in the reduction of deferred tax assets or payments of amounts accrued.

CONTINGENCIES

The Company’s assembly and test facility in Thailand is
located in Alphatechnopolis Industrial Park near Bangkok on land to which the
Company expects to acquire title in accordance with its agreement with the
landowner.  Progress towards obtaining
full title of the land has been delayed due to a complex financial
restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land.  At this time it is not possible to estimate
when, or if, full title will be completed. 
The Company has provided reserves that it estimates will be adequate to
obtain full title.  Such reserves are set
at the estimated fair value of the land.

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is
involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant,
and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.  Although the outcome of these actions is not
presently determinable, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not harm its business. 
Litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon, and
the Company is, and from time to time has been, subject to such litigation.

In the Company’s
opinion, based on consultation with legal counsel, as of March 31, 2005,
the effect of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

Stockholder
Rights Plan.

Effective
October 11, 1999, the Company adopted an Amended and Restated Preferred
Shares Rights Agreement (the “Amended Rights Agreement”).  The Amended Rights Agreement amends and
restates the Preferred Share Rights Agreement adopted by the Company as of February 13,
1995 (the “Prior Rights Agreement”). 
Under the Prior Rights Agreement, on February 13, 1995, the Company’s
Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right (a “Right”) to purchase one
one-hundredth of a share of the Company’s Series A Participating Preferred
Stock (“Series A Preferred”) for each outstanding share of common stock,
$.001 par value, of the Company.  The
dividend was payable on February 24, 1995 to stockholders of record as of
the close of business on that date.  The
Amended Rights Agreement supersedes the Prior Rights Agreement as originally
executed.  Under the Amended Rights
Agreement, each Right enables the holder to purchase from the Company one
one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred at a purchase price of
seventy four dollars and seven cents ($74.07) (the “Purchase Price”), subject
to adjustment.  Under the Amended Rights
Agreement, the rights will become exercisable upon the earlier of (i) 10
days following a public announcement that a person or a group of affiliated or
associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common shares, or (ii) 10
days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company’s Board
of Directors) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to
make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result
in a beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding
common shares.

Stock
Repurchase Activity.

On
August 7, 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to
repurchase up to 2,500,000 shares of its common stock in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions.  As of
March 31, 2005, the Company had repurchased the entire 2,500,000 common
share authorization for $59.3 million. 
On March 11, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of its common stock in the open market
or in privately negotiated transactions. 
As of March 31, 2005, the Company had repurchased the entire
2,500,000 common share authorization for $66.1 million.  On April 22, 2004, the Company’s Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,500,000 shares of its
common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As of March 31, 2005, the Company had
repurchased 884,900 shares under this authorization for $23.3 million.  As of March 31, 2005, all but 818,332 of
the purchased shares under the authorizations had been reissued to fund stock
option exercises and purchases under the Company’s employee stock purchase
plan.  During the twelve months ended March 31,
2003, the Company purchased 1,264,700 shares of its common stock for $27.1
million.  During the twelve months ended March 31,
2004, the Company purchased 2,435,400 shares of its common stock for
$63.9 million, of which $10.6 million was not paid until April 2004
and is reflected in the March 31, 2004 accounts payable balance.  During the twelve months ended March 31,
2005, the Company purchased 2,184,800 shares of its common stock for $57.7

million.

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

The
Company maintains a contributory profit-sharing plan for its domestic employees
meeting certain eligibility and service requirements.  The plan qualifies under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and allows employees to
contribute up to 60% of their base salary, subject to maximum annual
limitations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Company shall make a matching
contribution of up to 25% of the first 4% of the participant’s eligible
compensation and may award up to an additional 25% under the discretionary
match.  All matches are provided on a quarterly
basis and require the participant to be an active employee at the end of each
quarter.  For the fiscal years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company contributions to the plan totaled $1.4

million, $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

The Company’s 2001 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “2001 Purchase Plan”) became effective on March 1, 2002.  The Board of Directors approved the 2001
Purchase Plan in May 2001 and the stockholders approved it in August 2001.  Under the 2001 Purchase Plan, eligible
employees of the Company may purchase shares of common stock at semi-annual
intervals through periodic payroll deductions. 
The purchase price in general will be 85% of the lower of the fair
market value of the common stock on the first day of the participant’s entry
date into the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the
semi-annual purchase date.  Depending
upon a participant’s entry date into the 2001 Purchase Plan, purchase periods
under the 2001 Purchase Plan consist of overlapping periods of either 24, 18,
12 or 6 months in duration.  2,450,000
shares of common stock have been previously reserved for issuance under the
2001 Purchase Plan.  In May 2003,
the Board of Directors reserved an additional 975,000 shares of common stock
for issuance under the 2001 Purchase Plan, which was approved by the
stockholders in August 2003.

F-22

In May 2003 and August 2003, the
Company’s Board and stockholders, respectively, each approved an annual
automatic increase in the number of shares reserved under the 2001 Purchase
Plan.  The automatic increase took effect
on January 1, 2005, and on each January 1 thereafter during the term
of the plan, and is equal to the lesser of (i) 1,500,000 shares, (ii) one
half of one percent (0.5%) of the then outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock, or (iii) such lesser amount as is approved by the Company’s
Board of Directors.  On January 1,
2005, 1,035,863

additional
shares were reserved under the 2001 Purchase Plan based on the automatic
increase.

During fiscal 1995, a purchase plan was
adopted for employees in non-U.S. locations. 
Such plan allows for the purchase price per share to be 100% of the
lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the beginning or end of
the semi-annual purchase plan period. 
Since the inception of this purchase plan, 348,593 shares of common
stock have been reserved for issuance and 232,254 shares have been issued under
this purchase plan.

Effective January 1, 1997, the Company adopted a
non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement.  This plan is unfunded and is maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group
of highly compensated employees as defined in ERISA Sections 201, 301 and
401.  There are no Company matching
contributions made under this plan.

The Company has a management incentive
compensation plan which provides for bonus payments, based on a percentage of
base salary, from an incentive pool created from operating profits of the
Company, at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  During the years ended March 31, 2005
and March 31, 2004, $10.2 million and $1.8 million was charged against
operations for this plan, respectively. 
The Company did not make any payments under its management incentive
compensation plan during fiscal 2003.

The Company also has a plan that, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, provides a cash bonus to all employees of the Company based
on the operating profits of the Company. 
During the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, $4.9 million,
$2.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, were charged against operations
for this plan.

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

Under the Company’s equity incentive plans (the “Plans”), eligible
participants may be granted different types of equity incentive awards.  No awards other than stock options have been
awarded under our equity incentive plans as of March 31, 2005.  Officers, key employees, non-employee
directors and consultants may be granted non-statutory stock options to
purchase shares of common stock at a price not less than 100% of the fair value
of the option shares on the grant date. 
Options granted under the Plans vest over the period determined by the
Board of Directors at the date of grant, at periods ranging from one year to
four years.  The maximum term of options
granted under the Plans is 10 years.  The
Company did not make any stock option grants to consultants during the years
ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 
At March 31, 2005, there were 15,122,075 shares available for
grant under the Plans.  The per share
weighted average fair value of stock options granted under the Plans for the
years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $15.82, $12.06 and $15.00,
respectively, based on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions:

F-23

Under the Plans, 105,281,645 shares of common stock had been
reserved for issuance since the inception of the Plans.

The
stock option activity is as follows:

The
following table summarizes information about the stock options outstanding at March 31,
2005:

At March 31, 2005 and 2004, the number of option shares
exercisable was 16,014,070 and 11,583,715, respectively, and the
weighted-average exercise price of those options was $18.09 and $13.26,
respectively.

The Company received a tax benefit of $15.3 million, $37.6
million and $18.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, from the exercise of non-qualified stock options and the
disposition of stock acquired with incentive stock options or through the
Company’s employee stock purchase plan. 
For financial reporting purposes, the tax effect of this deduction is
accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather than as a
reduction of income tax expense.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company leases office space, transportation and other
equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through March 31,
2010.  The future minimum lease
commitments under these leases are payable as follows (amounts in thousands):

Rental expense under operating leases totaled $5.9 million,
$5.4 million and $5.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

primarily in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of
semiconductor products.  The Company
sells its products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
in a broad range of market segments, performs on-going credit evaluations of
its customers and generally requires no collateral.  The Company’s operations outside the United
States consist of product assembly and final test facilities in Thailand, and sales
and support centers and design centers in certain foreign countries.  Domestic operations are responsible for the
design, development and wafer fabrication of all products, as well as the
coordination of production planning and shipping to meet worldwide customer
commitments.  The Thailand assembly and test
facility is reimbursed in relation to value added with respect to assembly and
test operations and other functions performed, and certain foreign sales
offices receive compensation for export sales within their territory.  Accordingly, for financial statement
purposes, it is not meaningful to segregate sales or operating profits for the assembly
and test and foreign sales office operations. 
Identifiable long-lived assets (consisting of property, plant and
equipment and goodwill) by geographic area are as follows (amounts in

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amount of cash equivalents
approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months.  The carrying amount of short-term investments
approximates fair value because the longer-term instruments have interest rate
reset features that regularly adjust to current market rates.  The carrying amount of accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of the amounts.  The
fair value of capital lease obligations, long-term debt and lines of credit
approximate their carrying value as they are estimated by discounting the
future cash flows at rates currently offered to the Company for similar debt
instruments.

The Company has entered into certain financial instruments
in the normal course of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates.  These financial
instruments include standby letters of credit and foreign currency forward
contracts.  When engaging in forward
contracts, risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet
the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest
rates and foreign exchange rates.  At March 31,
2005, there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.  At March 31, 2004, the Company held
contracts with nominal amounts totaling $3.2 million, which were entered into
and hedged the Company’s foreign currency risk. 
The value of the contracts is based on quoted market prices.  The contracts matured in June 2004.  Unrealized gains and losses as of the balance
sheet dates and realized gains and losses for the years ending March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 were not material.
