Business and Properties

Hess Corporation (the Registrant) is a Delaware corporation,
    incorporated in 1920. The Registrant and its subsidiaries
    (collectively referred to as the Corporation or Hess) is a
    global integrated energy company that operates in two segments,
    Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining
    (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops,
    produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural
    gas. These exploration and production activities take place
    principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei,
    China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France,
    Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia,
    Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. The M&R
    segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases,
    markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and
    electricity. The Corporation owns 50% of a refinery joint
    venture in the United States Virgin Islands. An additional
    refining facility, terminals and retail gasoline stations, most
    of which include convenience stores, are located on the East
    Coast of the United States.

    barrels undeveloped). Total natural gas liquids reserves at
    December 31, 2009, were 71 million barrels
    (41 million barrels developed and 30 million barrels
    undeveloped).

On a barrel of oil equivalent (boe) basis, 45% of the
    Corporation’s worldwide proved reserves are undeveloped at
    December 31, 2010 (41% at December 31, 2009). Proved
    reserves held under production sharing contracts at
    December 31, 2010 totaled 15% of crude oil and natural gas
    liquids and 51% of natural gas reserves (24% and 57%,
    respectively, at December 31, 2009).

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revised its oil and
    gas reserve estimation and disclosure standards effective
    December 31, 2009. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data
    on pages 88 through 97 in the accompanying financial

A description of our significant E&P operations follows:

United
    States

At December 31, 2010, 23% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in the United States. During 2010,
    29% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids
    production and 16% of its natural gas production were from
    United States operations. The Corporation’s production in
    the United States was from properties offshore in the Gulf of
    Mexico, as well as onshore properties in the Williston Basin of
    North Dakota and in the Permian Basin of Texas.

Offshore:

The Corporation’s
    production offshore the United States was principally from the
    Shenzi (Hess 28%), Llano (Hess 50%), Conger (Hess 38%), Baldpate
    (Hess 50%), Hack Wilson (Hess 25%) and Penn State (Hess 50%)
    fields. At the Shenzi Field, the operator is pursuing water
    injection and additional development drilling opportunities.
    However, development and exploration activities are currently
    being affected by the uncertain regulatory environment in the
    Gulf of Mexico. See Gulf of Mexico Update on page 12.

At the Pony project on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%),
    the Corporation has signed a non-binding agreement in principle
    with the owners on adjacent Green Canyon Block 512 that
    outlines a proposal to jointly develop the Pony and Knotty Head
    fields. Negotiation of a joint operating agreement and planning
    for field development are underway. The agreement in principle
    provides that Hess will be operator of the joint development.
    The Corporation also commenced and subsequently suspended
    drilling the Pony 3 appraisal well on Green Canyon
    Block 469 in 2010. The Corporation is planning to resume
    drilling in 2011 contingent upon receipt of necessary permits.

In the third quarter of 2010, the Corporation acquired an
    additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field
    in the Gulf of Mexico. The Corporation now has a 40% working
    interest in the field and is operator. Engineering and design
    work for the field development progressed during 2010 and will
    continue in 2011.

At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had interests in 306
    blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, of which 272 were exploration
    blocks comprising 1,069,000 net undeveloped acres, with an
    additional 78,000 net acres held for production and
    development operations.



Onshore:

In North Dakota, the
    Corporation holds more than 900,000 net acres in the Bakken
    oil shale play (Bakken). In December 2010, the Corporation
    acquired approximately 85,000 net acres in the Bakken
    through the purchase of American Oil & Gas Inc.
    (American Oil & Gas) through the issuance of
    approximately 8.6 million shares of the Corporation’s
    stock. Further, in December 2010, the Corporation acquired an
    additional 167,000 net acres in the Bakken from TRZ Energy,
    LLC for $1,075 million in cash. The Corporation is
    currently operating 18 drilling rigs in the Bakken and is
    expanding production and export facilities to accommodate future
    production growth. In 2011, the Corporation plans to invest
    $1.8 billion for drilling and infrastructure in the Bakken.

In Texas, the Corporation holds a 34% interest in the
    Seminole-San Andres Unit and is operator. The Corporation
    is developing a part of this producing field using tertiary
    CO


flooding operations.

During 2010, the Corporation acquired approximately
    90,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford shale formation in
    Texas. The Corporation plans to drill an initial six exploration
    wells, which will be followed by 12 appraisal wells. Exploration
    drilling commenced in the fourth quarter of 2010.

In the Marcellus gas shale formation in Pennsylvania, the
    Corporation is operator and holds a 100% interest on
    approximately 53,000 net acres and holds a 50% non-operated
    interest in approximately 38,000 net acres. There is
    currently a drilling moratorium in the Delaware River Basin
    area, where the majority of the Corporation’s acreage is
    located. The moratorium is expected to remain in place until the
    Delaware River Basin Commission establishes new drilling
    regulations.

Europe

At December 31, 2010, 38% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in Europe (United Kingdom 6%,
    Norway 22%, Denmark 3% and Russia 7%). During 2010, 30% of the
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
    and 20% of its natural gas production were from European
    operations.

United Kingdom:

Production of crude oil
    and natural gas liquids from the United Kingdom North Sea was
    principally from the Corporation’s non-operated interests
    in the Nevis (Hess 27%), Bittern (Hess 28%), Schiehallion (Hess
    16%) and Beryl (Hess 22%) fields. Natural gas production from
    the United Kingdom was primarily from the Bacton Area (Hess
    23%), Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), Everest (Hess 19%),
    Beryl (Hess 22%), Nevis (Hess 27%) and Lomond (Hess 17%) fields.
    The Corporation also has an 18% interest in the Central Area
    Transmission System (CATS) pipeline and interests in the
    Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) fields.

In September 2010, the Corporation disposed of all of its
    interests in the Clair Field as part of an exchange for
    additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway as
    further described below.

In February 2011, the Corporation completed the previously
    announced sale of a package of natural gas producing assets in
    the United Kingdom North Sea including its interests in the
    Easington Catchment Area, the Bacton Area, the Everest Field and
    the Lomond Field for approximately $350 million, after
    closing adjustments. The sale of the Corporation’s interest
    in the CATS pipeline is expected to close in the second quarter
    of 2011.

Norway:

Substantially all of the 2010
    Norwegian production was from the Corporation’s interest in
    the Valhall Field (Hess 64%). The Corporation also holds an
    interest in the Hod (Hess 63%), Snohvit (Hess 3%) and Snorre
    (Hess 1%) fields. All four of the Corporation’s Norwegian
    field interests are located offshore.

In September 2010, the Corporation exchanged its interests in
    Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for
    additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the
    Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. Also in September 2010, the
    Corporation completed the acquisition of an additional 8%
    interest in the Valhall Field and 13% interest in the Hod Field
    for $507 million. After these transactions, the
    Corporation’s interests in the Valhall and Hod fields are
    now 64% and 63%, respectively.

A field redevelopment for Valhall commenced in 2007 and the
    Valhall Flank Gas Lift project was sanctioned in 2009. In 2010,
    the operator continued work on these projects, which are
    expected to be completed and commissioned in 2011. In 2011,
    further drilling is planned for Valhall, which will include the
    addition of a

jack-up

rig
    during the second half of the year.



Denmark:

Crude oil and natural gas
    production comes from the Corporation’s operated interest
    in the South Arne Field (Hess 58%). In 2010, the Corporation
    drilled two new production wells and sanctioned an additional
    development phase at South Arne, which will include design,
    construction and installation of two new platforms and related
    infrastructure.

Russia:

The Corporation’s
    activities in Russia are conducted through its interest in a
    subsidiary operating in the Volga-Urals region. In the third
    quarter of 2010, the Corporation acquired an additional 5%
    interest in its subsidiary, increasing its ownership to 85%. As
    of December 31, 2010, this subsidiary had exploration and
    production rights in 18 license areas in the Samara and
    Ulyanovsk territories.

France:

In 2010, the Corporation
    entered into an agreement with Toreador Resources Corporation
    (Toreador) under which it can invest in an initial exploration
    phase and earn up to a 50% working interest in, and become
    operator of, Toreador’s Paris Basin acreage. An initial six
    exploration well program is scheduled to begin in 2011, with the
    first well expected to spud in the first half of 2011.

Africa

At December 31, 2010, 18% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in Africa (Equatorial Guinea 6%,
    Algeria 1% and Libya 11%). During 2010, 37% of the
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
    was from African operations. In September 2010, the Corporation
    disposed of all of its interests in Gabon as part of the
    exchange for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields
    in Norway.

Equatorial Guinea:

The Corporation is
    the operator and owns an interest in Block G (Hess 85%) which
    contains the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex. In 2010, a 4D
    seismic survey was acquired covering the Okume Complex and the
    Ceiba Field. This seismic data will be processed and evaluated
    in 2011 in preparation for potential further development
    drilling.

Algeria:

The Corporation has a 49%
    interest in a venture with the Algerian national oil company
    that redeveloped three oil fields. The Corporation also has an
    interest in Bir El Msana (BMS) Block 401C.

Libya:

The Corporation, in conjunction
    with its Oasis Group partners, has oil and gas production
    operations in the Waha concessions in Libya (Hess 8%). The
    Corporation also owns a 100% interest in offshore exploration
    Area 54 in the Mediterranean Sea, where a successful exploration
    well was drilled in 2008. In 2009, the Corporation successfully
    drilled a down-dip appraisal well. In 2010, the Corporation
    received a five year extension to the Area 54 license.

Egypt:

The Corporation has an interest
    in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med
    Block) (Hess 55%). In September 2010, the Corporation recorded
    an after-tax charge of $347 million to fully impair the
    carrying value of its interest in the West Med Block and to
    expense a previously capitalized well. See further discussion in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations on page 29. The Corporation also
    owns a 100% interest in Block 1 offshore Egypt in the North
    Red Sea. The Corporation spud an exploration well on the North
    Red Sea block in late December 2010, the completion of which may
    be delayed by the current political unrest in Egypt. In December
    2010, the Corporation entered a farm-out agreement that will,
    subject to government approval, reduce its interest in the block
    from 100% to 80%.

Ghana:

The Corporation holds a 100%
    interest in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points License. In
    2010, the Corporation acquired additional 3D seismic data and
    plans to drill a second exploration well on this block in 2011.

Asia

At December 31, 2010, 21% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in the Asia region (JDA 9%,
    Indonesia 6%, Thailand 3%, Azerbaijan 2% and Malaysia 1%).
    During 2010, 4% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
    gas liquids production and 64% of its natural gas production
    were from its Asian operations.

Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand
    (JDA):

The Corporation owns an interest in
    Block

A-18

of the JDA (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand. In 2011, the
    operator will continue development of the block with further
    drilling and construction of additional platform facilities.



Malaysia:

The Corporation’s
    production in Malaysia comes from its interest in Block PM301
    (Hess 50%), which is adjacent to Block

A-18

of the
    JDA where the natural gas is processed. The Corporation also
    owns an interest in Block PM302 (Hess 50%) and Belud —
    Block SB302 (Hess 40%). Through December 31, 2010 the
    Corporation has drilled two wells on Block SB302 which were
    natural gas discoveries. Technical and commercial evaluations
    are underway to assess the development alternatives for this
    block.

Indonesia:

The Corporation’s
    natural gas production in Indonesia primarily comes from its
    interests offshore in the Ujung Pangkah project (Hess 75%), and
    the Natuna A Field (Hess 23%). In 2010, the Corporation
    installed a new wellhead platform at Ujung Pangkah and will
    install a new central processing platform in 2011 to expand oil
    and water handling capacity. At the Natuna A Field the operator
    is constructing a second wellhead platform and a central
    processing platform, which is expected to be placed in service
    in 2011. The Corporation also holds a 100% working interest in
    the offshore Semai V Block, where it plans to drill three
    exploration wells beginning in 2011. The Corporation owns a 100%
    working interest in the offshore South Sesulu Block and a 49%
    interest in the West Timor Block. In 2010, the Corporation sold
    its interest in the Jambi Merang onshore natural gas development
    project.

Thailand:

The Corporation’s
    natural gas production in Thailand primarily comes from the
    offshore Pailin Field (Hess 15%) and the onshore Sinphuhorm
    Block (Hess 35%).

Azerbaijan:

The Corporation has an
    interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields (Hess 3%) in
    the Caspian Sea and also owns an interest in the
    Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan oil transportation pipeline (Hess 2%). In
    2010, the Corporation sanctioned the Chirag Oil Development
    project at ACG. This project includes construction and
    installation of a production, drilling and living-quarters
    platform and further development drilling.

Brunei:

The Corporation has a 14%
    interest in Block

CA-1

(previously known as Block J). The Corporation expects the
    operator to begin exploration drilling in the second half of
    2011.

China:

The Corporation has signed a
    joint study agreement with China National Petroleum Corporation
    and two joint study agreements with Sinopec to evaluate
    unconventional oil and gas resource opportunities in China.

Other
    Exploration Areas

Australia:

The Corporation holds a 100%
    interest in an exploration license covering 780,000 acres
    in the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia (WA-390-P
    Block). The Corporation has drilled all of the 16 commitment
    wells on the block, 13 of which were natural gas discoveries. In
    the fourth quarter of 2010, the Corporation commenced an
    appraisal program that includes further drilling and flow
    testing certain wells. In November 2010, the Corporation sold
    its 50% interest in the WA-404-P Block located offshore Western
    Australia.

Brazil:

The Corporation has a 40%
    interest in block BM-S-22 located offshore Brazil. In early
    2011, the operator completed drilling of a third exploration
    well on this block, which did not encounter commercial
    quantities of hydrocarbons. See further discussion in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations on page 23. The Corporation also
    had an interest in Block BM-ES-30 but reassigned its 30%
    interest in 2010, pending government approval.

Peru:

The Corporation has an interest
    in Block 64 in Peru (Hess 50%). In 2010, the Corporation
    successfully drilled a sidetrack to an exploration well on this
    block. Further evaluation work is planned for 2011.

Colombia:

The Corporation has interests
    in offshore Blocks RC 6 and RC 7 (Hess 30%).

Sales
    Commitments

In the E&P segment, the Corporation has no contracts or
    agreements to sell fixed quantities of its crude oil production.
    The Corporation has contracts to supply fixed quantities of
    natural gas, principally relating to producing fields in Asia.
    The most significant of these commitments relates to the JDA
    where the minimum contract quantity of natural gas is estimated
    at 107 million mcf per year based on current entitlements
    under a natural gas sales contract expiring in 2027. There are
    additional natural gas supply commitments on producing fields in
    Thailand and Indonesia which currently total approximately
    42 million mcf per year under contracts expiring in years
    2021 through 2029. The Corporation is also currently committed
    to supply 7 million mcf per year of natural gas from its



share of production to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing
    facility in Norway under a contract expiring in 2026. The
    estimated total volume of natural gas subject to sales
    commitments under these contracts is approximately
    2,700 million mcf. The Corporation has not experienced any
    significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities
    under these natural gas sales contracts and it anticipates being
    able to meet future requirements from available proved and
    probable reserves. In the United States there are no long-term
    sales contracts for natural gas production from the E&P
    segment.

Natural gas is marketed by the M&R segment on a spot basis
    and under contracts for varying periods of time to local
    distribution companies, and commercial, industrial and other
    purchasers. These natural gas marketing activities are primarily
    conducted in the eastern portion of the United States, where the
    principal source of supply is purchased natural gas, not the
    Corporation’s production from the E&P segment. The
    Corporation has not experienced any significant constraints in
    obtaining the required supply of purchased natural gas.

Marketing
    and Refining

Refining

The Corporation owns a 50% interest in HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA),
    a refining joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands
    with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In
    addition, it owns and operates a refining facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey.

HOVENSA:

Refining operations at HOVENSA
    consist of crude units, a fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCC)
    and a delayed coker unit.

The following table summarizes capacity and utilization rates
    for HOVENSA:

In January 2011, HOVENSA announced plans to shut down certain
    older and smaller processing units on the west side of its
    refinery, which will reduce the refinery’s crude oil
    distillation capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per
    day, with no impact on the capacity of its coker or FCC unit.
    This reconfiguration, which is expected to be completed in the
    first quarter of 2011, is being undertaken to improve
    efficiency, reliability and competitiveness. In 2010, the
    Corporation recorded an impairment charge related to its
    investment in HOVENSA. For discussion of the impairment charge,
    see Note 4, Refining Joint Venture in the notes to the
    financial statements on page 59.

The delayed coker unit permits HOVENSA to run lower-cost heavy
    crude oil. HOVENSA has long-term supply contracts with PDVSA to
    purchase 115,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy
    crude oil and 155,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Mesa
    medium gravity crude oil. The remaining crude oil requirements
    are purchased mainly under contracts of one year or less from
    third parties and through spot purchases on the open market.
    After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third parties, the
    Corporation purchases 50% of HOVENSA’s remaining production
    at market prices.

Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 390,000 barrels per
    day in 2010 compared with 402,000 barrels per day in 2009
    and 441,000 barrels per day in 2008. The 2010 and 2009
    utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins,
    higher fuel costs and planned and unplanned maintenance. During
    the first quarter of 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at
    HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The 2008
    utilization rates reflect a refinery wide shut down for
    Hurricane Omar.

Port Reading Facility:

The Corporation
    owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey, with a capacity of 70,000 barrels per
    day. This facility, which processes residual fuel oil and vacuum



gas oil, operated at a rate of approximately 55,000 barrels
    per day in 2010 compared with 63,000 barrels per day in
    2009 and 64,000 barrels per day in 2008. Substantially all
    of Port Reading’s production is gasoline and heating oil.
    During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shutdown for
    41 days for a scheduled turnaround.

Marketing

The Corporation markets refined petroleum products, natural gas
    and electricity on the East Coast of the United States to the
    motoring public, wholesale distributors, industrial and
    commercial users, other petroleum companies, governmental
    agencies and public utilities.

The Corporation had 1,362
    HESS

®

gasoline stations at December 31, 2010, including stations
    owned by its WilcoHess joint venture (Hess 44%). Approximately
    92% of the gasoline stations are operated by the Corporation or
    WilcoHess. Of the operated stations, 94% have convenience stores
    on the sites. Most of the Corporation’s gasoline stations
    are in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida,
    Massachusetts, North Carolina and South Carolina.

    Port Reading in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    Corporation purchased the balance from third parties under
    short-term supply contracts and spot purchases.

The Corporation owns 20 terminals with an aggregate storage
    capacity of 22 million barrels in its East Coast marketing
    areas. The Corporation also owns a terminal in St. Lucia with a
    storage capacity of 9 million barrels, which is operated
    for third party storage.

The Corporation has a 50% interest in Bayonne Energy Center,
    LLC, a joint venture established to build and operate a
    512-megawatt natural gas fueled electric generating station in
    Bayonne, New Jersey. The joint venture plans to sell electricity
    into the New York City market by a direct connection with the
    Con Edison Gowanus substation. Construction of the facility
    began in mid-2010 and operations are expected to commence in
    2012.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
    Corporation also takes energy commodity and derivative trading
    positions for its own account.

The Corporation is pursuing opportunities for LNG import
    terminals in Shannon, Ireland and on the East Coast of the
    United States. In addition, a subsidiary of the Corporation is
    exploring the development of fuel cell and hydrogen reforming
    technologies.

Gulf of Mexico Update:

In April 2010, an
    accident occurred on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling
    rig at the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf
    of Mexico, resulting in loss of life, the sinking of the rig and
    a significant crude oil spill. The Corporation was not a
    participant in the well. As a result of the accident, a
    temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico.
    In October 2010, the drilling moratorium was lifted by the
    United States Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean
    Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) provided
    operators complied with all rules and requirements, including a
    series of new drilling and safety rules issued by BOEMRE. The
    Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new
    requirements on its activities in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as
    seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection
    with planned activities. However, the new regulatory environment
    is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher
    costs.

The moratorium impacted development drilling at the Shenzi
    Field, in which the Corporation has a 28% interest. A production
    well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a
    second production well that was planned for 2010 was postponed.
    The Corporation estimates that these delays reduced 2010
    production by approximately 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
    day (boepd) and will likely reduce 2011 production by
    approximately 4,000 boepd. In 2010, the Corporation’s only
    operated drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth,
    left the Pony project on Green Canyon 469 as part of a
    preexisting agreement for a one well farm-out of the rig to
    another operator.

In January 2011, the BOEMRE announced that supplementary
    environmental reviews will not be required of 13 companies
    to resume work on the 16 wells that were in progress when
    the moratorium took effect, including the aforementioned
    suspended Shenzi and Pony wells. However, these projects must
    comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can
    resume. As a result, the Corporation does not anticipate that it
    will be able to re-commence these operations before the second
    half of 2011.

Additionally, the Corporation has filed Suspension of Operations
    (SOO) applications with the BOEMRE for several exploration block
    licenses in the Gulf of Mexico that are due to expire in 2011
    and may file additional applications as deemed necessary. These
    SOO applications seek approval for extension of the lease
    expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the
    Corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the
    licenses.

Remediation Plans and Procedures:

The
    Corporation has in place a series of asset-specific emergency
    response and continuity plans which detail procedures for rapid
    and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation
    activities for its global offshore operations. These plans are
    maintained, reviewed and updated annually to ensure their
    accuracy and suitability.

Where appropriate, plans are reviewed and approved by the
    relevant host government authorities on a periodic basis. The
    Corporation has a current oil spill response plan for its Gulf
    of Mexico operations that has been approved by the BOEMRE. This
    plan sets forth expectations for response training, drills and
    capabilities and the strategies, procedures and methods that
    will be employed in the event of a spill covering the following
    topics: spill response organization, incident command post,
    communications and notifications, spill detection and assessment
    (including worst case discharge scenarios), identification and
    protection of environmental resources, strategic response
    planning, mobilization and deployment of spill response
    equipment and personnel, oil and debris removal and disposal,
    the use of dispersants and chemical and biological agents,
    in-situ burning of oil, wildlife rehabilitation and
    documentation requirements.

Responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to
    assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the
    Corporation’s plans. The Corporation’s contractors,
    service providers, representatives from government agencies and,
    where applicable, joint venture partners participate in the
    drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and
    can be effectively implemented.

To complement internal capabilities, the Corporation maintains
    membership contracts with oil spill response organizations to
    provide coverage for its global drilling and production
    operations. These organizations are Clean Gulf Associates,
    National Response Corporation (NRC) and Oil Spill Response
    (OSR). Clean Gulf Associates is a regional spill response
    organization for the Gulf of Mexico; NRC and OSR are global
    response corporations and are available to assist the
    Corporation when needed anywhere in the world. In addition to
    owning response assets in



their own right, these organizations maintain business
    relationships that provide immediate access to additional
    critical response support services if required. These owned
    response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels
    and barges, more than 250 skimmers, over 300,000 feet of
    boom, and significant quantities of dispersants and other
    ancillary equipment, including aircraft. If the Corporation were
    to request these organizations to obtain additional critical
    response support services, it would provide the funding for such
    services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverages
    described below. In certain circumstances, the Corporation
    pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other
    companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil
    spill response equipment and personnel support. It also has
    representation on the Executive Committee of Clean Gulf
    Associates and the Board of Directors of OSR, maintaining close
    associations with these organizations.

In light of the recent events in the Gulf of Mexico, the
    Corporation is participating in a number of industry-wide task
    forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and
    prevent offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in
    subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery
    methods. The task forces are working closely with the oil and
    gas industry and international government agencies to implement
    improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill
    prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes.

Insurance Coverage and Indemnification:

The
    Corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage
    for physical damage to its property, third party liability,
    workers’ compensation and employers’ liability,
    general liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other
    coverage. This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles,
    exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such
    coverage will adequately protect the Corporation against
    liability from all potential consequences and damages.

The amount of insurance covering physical damage to the
    Corporation’s property and liability related to negative
    environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental
    pollution event, excluding windstorm coverage in the Gulf of
    Mexico where it is self insured, varies by asset, based on the
    asset’s estimated replacement value or the estimated
    maximum loss. In the case of a catastrophic event, first party
    coverage consists of two tiers of insurance. The first
    $250 million of coverage is provided through an industry
    mutual insurance group. Above this $250 million threshold,
    insurance is carried which ranges in value to over
    $1.9 billion in total, depending on the asset coverage
    level, as described above. Additionally, the Corporation carries
    insurance which provides third party coverage for general
    liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to
    $995 million.

Other insurance policies provide coverage for, among other
    things: charterer’s legal liability, in the amount of
    $500 million per occurrence and aircraft liability, in the
    amount of $300 million per occurrence.

The Corporation’s insurance policies renew at various dates
    each year. Future insurance coverage for the industry could
    increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or
    retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations. In
    addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the
    future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically
    acceptable.

Generally, the Corporation’s drilling contracts (and most
    of its other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual
    hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the
    contract (the Corporation and Contractor) indemnifies the other
    party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property
    regardless of fault. Variations include indemnity exclusions to
    the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence

and/or

willful misconduct of a party. Third-party claims, on the other
    hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis.

The Corporation is customarily responsible for, and indemnifies
    the Contractor against, all claims, including those from
    third-parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or
    contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or
    other property (regardless of fault, including gross negligence
    and willful misconduct) and the Contractor is responsible for
    and indemnifies the Corporation for all claims attributable to
    pollution emanating from the Contractor’s property.
    Additionally, the Corporation is generally liable for all of its
    own losses and most third-party claims associated with
    catastrophic losses such as blowouts, cratering and loss of
    hole, regardless of cause, although exceptions for losses
    attributable to gross negligence

and/or

willful misconduct do exist. Lastly, many offshore services
    contracts include overall limitations of the Contractor’s
    liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount,
    whichever is greater.

Under a standard joint operating agreement (JOA), each party is
    liable for all claims arising under the JOA, not covered by or
    in excess of insurance carried by the JOA, to the extent of its
    participating interest (operator or non-



operator). Variations include indemnity exclusions where the
    claim is based upon the gross negligence

and/or

willful misconduct of a party in which case such party is solely
    liable.

Environmental:

Compliance with various
    existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed
    by federal, state, local and foreign governments is not expected
    to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s
    financial condition or results of operations. The Corporation
    spent $13 million in 2010 for environmental remediation.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors Related to Our Business and Operations

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant risk factors, including those described
    below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect
    our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of
    operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our
    securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is
    possible additional risks relating to our securities may be
    described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in
    the future.

Our business and operating results are highly dependent on
    the market prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum
    products and electricity, which can be very
    volatile.

Our estimated proved reserves, revenue,
    operating cash flows, operating margins, future earnings and
    trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude
    oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity,
    which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control.
    Historically these prices have been very volatile. The major
    foreign oil producing countries, including members of the
    Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert
    considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil
    and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to
    agree on a common policy on rates of production and other
    matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The
    commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand
    factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil,
    natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity. To the
    extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate
    commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of
    price increases above the hedged price. Changes in commodity
    prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin
    requirements under our derivative contracts. In addition, we
    utilize significant bank credit facilities to support these
    collateral and margin requirements. An inability to renew or
    replace such credit facilities as they mature would negatively
    impact our liquidity.

If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future
    crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely
    impacted.

We own or have access to a finite
    amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time.
    Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including
    proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful
    exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced
    recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is
    dependent on technical success in finding and developing
    additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves
    the interpretation of seismic and other geological and
    geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the
    presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling
    risks include



unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or
    formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather
    interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen
    reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or
    flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities
    have increased in recent years which could negatively affect
    expected economic returns. Reserve replacement can also be
    achieved through acquisition. Although due diligence is used in
    evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar risks may be
    encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties
    acquired from others.

There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of
    proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow, and actual
    quantities may be lower than estimated.

Numerous
    uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves
    and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future
    production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital
    expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable
    oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed
    in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated
    quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net
    revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to
    downward or upward revisions based on production performance,
    purchases or sales of properties, results of future development,
    prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts,
    which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices
    increase, and other factors.

We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other
    governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect
    our business.

Federal, state, local, territorial
    and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, expropriation or nationalization of
    property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or
    amendment of contract rights, and changes in import and export
    regulations, limitations on access to exploration and
    development opportunities, as well as other political
    developments may affect our operations. We also market motor
    fuels through lessee-dealers and wholesalers in certain states
    where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil
    from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels.
    Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various
    other states. As a result of the accident in April 2010 at the
    BP-operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico (in which the
    Corporation was not a participant) and the ensuing significant
    oil spill, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the
    Gulf of Mexico. While this moratorium has since been lifted,
    significant new regulations have been imposed and further
    legislation and regulations may be proposed, including an
    increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil
    spill. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the conditions under
    which future drilling in the Gulf of Mexico will occur. However,
    the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer
    permitting process and higher costs.

Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely
    affect our business.

Some of the international
    areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we
    operate, are politically less stable than other areas and
    partners. Current political unrest in North Africa and the
    Middle East may affect our operations in these areas as well as
    oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around
    the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the
    oil and gas industry.

Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks
    and environmental laws and regulations that can result in
    significant costs and liabilities.

Our oil and
    gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to
    environmental risk such as oil spills, produced water spills,
    gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases
    that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or
    other environmental damage. For example, the accident at the
    BP-operated Macondo prospect in April 2010 resulted in a
    significant release of crude oil which caused extensive
    environmental and economic damage. Our operations are also
    subject to numerous United States federal, state, local and
    foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with
    these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative,
    civil or criminal penalties, remedial

clean-ups

and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition,
    increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly
    relating to the production of motor and other fuels, have
    resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital
    expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas
    industry in general.

Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have
    operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the
    drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas
    resources, particularly using the process of hydraulic
    fracturing. While we believe that these operations can be
    conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment,
    regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may
    impose temporary moratoriums and new regulations on such
    drilling operations that would likely have the effect of
    delaying and increasing the cost of such operations.



Concerns about climate change may result in significant
    operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our
    products.

We recognize that climate change is a
    global environmental concern. Continuing political and social
    attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both
    existing and pending international agreements and national,
    regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit
    greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may
    require significant equipment modifications, operational
    changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce
    emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may
    result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance,
    operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, we
    manufacture petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use
    result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory
    initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our
    sales of, and revenues from, these products. Finally, to the
    extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather
    related events, we could experience increased costs related to
    prevention, maintenance and remediation of affected operations
    in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and
    shutdowns.

Our industry is highly competitive and many of our
    competitors are larger and have greater resources than
    us.

The petroleum industry is highly competitive
    and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from
    numerous companies in each of our activities, including
    acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas, and
    in purchasing and marketing of refined products, natural gas and
    electricity. Many competitors, including national oil companies,
    are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also
    in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of
    energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets
    has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In
    addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise
    and equipment has, in the recent past, affected the availability
    of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased
    capital and operating costs.

Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man-made,
    may materially affect our operations and financial
    conditions.

Our oil and gas operations are
    subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from
    time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt
    operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples
    of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and
    blowouts, such as the accident at the Macondo prospect operated
    by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Although we maintain a level of
    insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against
    property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that
    such insurance will adequately protect the Corporation against
    liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover,
    some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be
    available only on terms that are deemed economically
    unacceptable.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving
    water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in
    jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE
    and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE,
    including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases
    is that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that
    these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share
    of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and
    are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged
    effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the
    majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In
    2010, additional cases were settled, and three new cases were
    filed. The six unresolved cases consist of five cases that have
    been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the Southern
    District of New York as part of a multi-district litigation
    proceeding and an action brought in state court by the State of
    New Hampshire. In 2007, a pre-tax charge of $40 million was
    recorded to cover all of the known MTBE cases against the
    Corporation.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual



refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly,
    depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the
    circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the
    refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution
    controls. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a Consent Decree with
    EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent
    Decree, HOVENSA will pay a penalty of approximately
    $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over
    the next 10 years to install equipment and implement
    additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to
    reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires
    HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an
    environmental project to be determined at a later date by the
    Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water
    and Power Authority with monitoring. The Consent Decree has been
    lodged with the United States District Court for the Virgin
    Islands and approval is pending. In addition, substantial
    progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the
    Port Reading refining facility, which is not expected to have a
    material adverse impact on the Corporation’s financial
    position or results of operations.

On September 13, 2007, HOVENSA received a Notice Of
    Violation (NOV) pursuant to section 113(a)(i) of the Clean
    Air Act (Act) from the EPA finding that HOVENSA failed to obtain
    proper permitting for the construction and operation of its
    delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and
    regulations. HOVENSA believes it properly obtained all necessary
    permits for this project. The NOV states that the EPA has
    authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties
    for violation of the Act. This matter is resolved by the Consent
    Decree discussed above, provided that the Consent Decree is
    entered by the court.

In December 2006, HOVENSA received a NOV from the EPA alleging
    non-compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the
    Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources
    (DPNR) for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit.
    The NOV was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and
    submission by HOVENSA regarding potential non-compliance with
    the permit emissions limits for two pollutants. Any exceedances
    were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants
    emitted in excess of the limits. This matter is resolved by the
    Consent Decree discussed above, provided that the Consent Decree
    is entered by the court.

On December 16, 2010, the Virgin Islands Department of
    Planning and Natural Resources commenced four separate
    enforcement actions against HOVENSA by issuance of documents
    titled “Notice Of Violation, Order For Corrective Action,
    Notice Of Assessment Of Civil Penalty, Notice Of Opportunity For
    Hearing” (the “NOVs”). The NOVs assert violations
    of Virgin Islands Air Pollution Control laws and regulations
    arising out of air release incidents at the HOVENSA refinery in
    2009 and 2010 and propose total penalties of $1,355,000. HOVENSA
    intends to vigorously defend this matter.

The Corporation received a directive from the New Jersey
    Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate
    contamination in the sediments of the lower Passaic River and
    NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive,
    insofar as it affects the Corporation, relates to alleged
    releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New
    Jersey now owned by the Corporation. The Corporation and over
    70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on
    Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination. NJDEP has
    also sued several other companies linked to a facility
    considered by the State to be the largest contributor to river
    contamination. In January 2009, these companies added third
    party defendants, including the Corporation, to that case. In
    June 2007, the EPA issued a draft study which evaluated six
    alternatives for early action, with costs ranging from
    $900 million to $2.3 billion. Based on adverse
    comments from the Corporation and others, the EPA is
    reevaluating its alternatives. In addition, the federal trustees
    for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of
    damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given the
    ongoing studies, remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at
    this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, the
    Corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a
    material liability because its terminal could not have
    contributed contamination along most of the river’s length
    and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest
    concern in the river sediments, and because there are numerous
    other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation
    and damages.

In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly
    owned subsidiary of the Corporation, and HOVENSA, each received
    a letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department
    of Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources
    Trustees, advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit
    against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
    alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
    damages to natural resources arising



from releases of hazardous substances from the HOVENSA Refinery,
    which had been operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action
    was filed on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the
    Virgin Islands against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that
    operated industrial facilities on the south shore of
    St. Croix asserting that the defendants are liable under
    CERCLA and territorial statutory and common law for damages to
    natural resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA do not believe that this
    matter will result in a material liability as they believe that
    they have strong defenses to this complaint, and they intend to
    vigorously defend this matter.

The Corporation periodically receives notices from EPA that it
    is a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
    legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
    this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
    jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
    claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation
    relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With
    respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s claims have been
    settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all
    cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of
    these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private
    parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot
    be predicted at this time due to the large number of other
    potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of

clean-up

cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
    and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
    to other environmental matters. The Corporation cannot predict
    with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved
    or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for
    proceedings that are in their early stages of development or
    where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may
    need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy
    discovery and determination of important factual matters before
    a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any
    proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s
    opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the
    outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse
    effect on the financial condition of the Corporation, although
    the outcome of such proceedings could be material to the
    Corporation’s results of operations and cash flows for a
    particular period depending on, among other things, the level of
    the Corporation’s net income for such period.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
    operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P)
    and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment
    explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and
    sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment
    manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets
    and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and
    electricity.

Net income in 2010 was $2,125 million compared with
    $740 million in 2009 and $2,360 million in 2008.
    Diluted earnings per share were $6.47 in 2010 compared with
    $2.27 in 2009 and $7.24 in 2008. A table of items affecting
    comparability between periods is shown on page 25.

Exploration
    and Production

The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to
    profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and
    financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were 1,537 million barrels of oil
    equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2010 compared with
    1,437 million boe at December 31, 2009 and
    1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008.

E&P earnings were $2,736 million in 2010,
    $1,042 million in 2009 and $2,423 million in 2008.
    Average realized crude oil selling prices were $66.20 per barrel
    in 2010, $51.62 in 2009, and $82.04 in 2008, including the
    impact of hedging. Production averaged 418,000 barrels of
    oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2010, an increase of 10,000
    boepd or 2.5% from 2009. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in
    2009, an increase of 27,000 boepd or 7% from 381,000 boepd in
    2008. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide production
    will average between 415,000 and 425,000 boepd in 2011.

The following is an update of significant E&P activities
    during 2010:

•

In December, the Corporation acquired approximately
    167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play (Bakken) in
    North Dakota for $1,075 million in cash from TRZ Energy,
    LLC. The Corporation also completed the acquisition of American
    Oil & Gas Inc. (American Oil & Gas) through
    the issuance of approximately 8.6 million shares of the
    Corporation’s stock, which further increased its acreage
    position in the Bakken by approximately 85,000 net acres.
    After these acquisitions, the Corporation holds more than
    900,000 net acres in the Bakken. The properties acquired
    are located near the Corporation’s existing acreage.

•

In September, the Corporation completed the exchange of its
    interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for
    additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields of 28% and
    25%, respectively. This non-monetary exchange, which was
    recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre-tax gain of
    $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes).
    The Corporation also completed the acquisition of an additional
    8% interest in the Valhall Field and 13% interest in the Hod
    Field for $507 million in cash. As a result of these
    transactions, the Corporation’s interests in the Valhall
    and Hod fields increased to 64% and 63%, respectively.

•

In the fourth quarter, the Corporation completed the acquisition
    of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas
    field in the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $40 million.
    The Corporation now has a 40% working interest and is operator
    of the field.

•

In January, the Corporation completed the sale of its interest
    in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia
    (Hess 25%) for cash proceeds of $183 million. The
    transaction resulted in a gain of $58 million.

•

In March, the Corporation agreed to the sale of its interests in
    a package of natural gas production and transportation assets in
    the United Kingdom North Sea. The package includes the
    Corporation’s interests in the Easington Catchment Area
    (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess
    19%), the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) and the Central Area
    Transmission System (CATS) pipeline (Hess 18%). In February
    2011, the Corporation completed the sale of the producing assets
    for approximately $350 million,



after closing adjustments. The sale of the Corporation’s
    interest in the CATS pipeline is expected to close in the second
    quarter of 2011.

•

In September, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge and
    dry hole expense totaling $554 million before income taxes
    ($347 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying
    value of unproved property and suspended well costs relating to
    its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1
    Concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt.

•

In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the
    Corporation drilled 4 exploration wells in 2010 on WA-390-P
    Block (Hess 100%). The Corporation has drilled all 16 commitment
    wells on the block, 13 of which were natural gas discoveries. In
    the fourth quarter of 2010, the Corporation commenced an
    appraisal program that includes further drilling and flow
    testing certain wells.

•

On the Pony project in Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%)
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation has signed a
    non-binding agreement in principle with the owners on the
    adjacent Green Canyon Block 512 that outlines a proposal to
    jointly develop the Pony and Knotty Head fields. The Corporation
    also spud and subsequently suspended an appraisal well on the
    Pony prospect in 2010. The Corporation is planning to resume
    drilling of the Pony appraisal well in 2011 contingent upon
    receipt of necessary drilling permits.

•

In November, the third exploration well was spud on Block
    BM-S-22 (Hess 40%) offshore Brazil which encountered
    noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. As a result, dry hole
    expenses totaling $111 million ($72 million after-tax)
    were recorded relating to this well and the previously suspended
    Azulão well, which was drilled in 2009.

Gulf of Mexico Update:

In April 2010,
    an accident occurred on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon
    drilling rig at the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in
    the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in loss of life, the sinking of
    the rig and a significant crude oil spill. The Corporation was
    not a participant in the well. As a result of the accident, a
    temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico.
    In October 2010, the drilling moratorium was lifted by the
    United States Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean
    Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) provided
    operators complied with all rules and requirements, including a
    series of new drilling and safety rules issued by BOEMRE. The
    Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new
    requirements on its activities in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as
    seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection
    with planned activities. However, the new regulatory environment
    is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher
    costs.

The moratorium impacted development drilling at the Shenzi
    Field, in which the Corporation has a 28% interest. A production
    well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a
    second production well that was planned for 2010 was postponed.
    The Corporation estimates that these delays reduced 2010
    production by approximately 2,000 boepd and will likely reduce
    2011 production by approximately 4,000 boepd. In 2010, the
    Corporation’s only operated drilling rig in the Gulf of
    Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony project on Green Canyon
    469 as part of a preexisting agreement for a one well farm-out
    of the rig to another operator.

In January 2011, the BOEMRE announced that supplementary
    environmental reviews will not be required of 13 companies
    to resume work on the 16 wells that were in progress when
    the moratorium took effect, including the aforementioned
    suspended Shenzi and Pony wells. However, these projects must
    comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can
    resume. As a result, the Corporation does not anticipate that it
    will be able to re-commence these operations before the second
    half of 2011.

Additionally, the Corporation has filed Suspension of Operations
    (SOO) applications with the BOEMRE for several exploration block
    licenses in the Gulf of Mexico that are due to expire in 2011
    and may file additional applications as deemed necessary. These
    SOO applications seek approval for extension of the lease
    expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the
    Corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the
    licenses.



Marketing
    and Refining

The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to
    deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash
    flow. M&R earnings (losses) were $(231) million in
    2010, $127 million in 2009 and $277 million in 2008.
    Refining operations generated losses of $445 million in
    2010 and $87 million in 2009 and income of $73 million
    in 2008. Refining results for 2010 include an after-tax
    impairment charge of $289 million ($300 million
    pre-tax) to reduce the carrying value of the Corporation’s
    investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. to the estimated fair value. The
    refining results in 2010 and 2009 also reflect weak refining
    margins and lower volumes. Marketing earnings were
    $215 million in 2010, $168 million in 2009 and
    $240 million in 2008.

Liquidity
    and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $4,530 million in 2010, $3,046 million in 2009 and
    $4,688 million in 2008, principally reflecting fluctuations
    in earnings. At December 31, 2010, cash and cash
    equivalents totaled $1,608 million compared with
    $1,362 million at December 31, 2009. Total debt was
    $5,583 million at December 31, 2010 compared with
    $4,467 million at December 31, 2009. In August 2010,
    the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year
    fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% that are scheduled to
    mature in 2041. The proceeds were used for the acquisition of
    additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the
    Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation
    completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of
    notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. The
    Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at
    December 31, 2010 was 24.9% compared with 24.8% at the end
    of 2009.

Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the

In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
    transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
    reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
    after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
    earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
    preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
    they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
    the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
    the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

Amounts differ from E&P
    operating revenues in Note 18, Segment Information,
    primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons
    purchased from third parties.

After considering the E&P items in the table on
    page 28, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are
    primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production
    and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses,
    foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below.

Selling prices:

Higher average selling
    prices increased E&P revenues by approximately
    $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Lower average
    selling prices reduced E&P revenues by approximately
    $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008.

In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil
    hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though
    2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same
    counterparty. The deferred after-tax loss as of the date the
    hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the
    contracts mature. The estimated annual after-tax loss from the
    closed positions will be approximately $330 million in 2011
    and 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by
    $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in
    2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income
    taxes) in 2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced
    E&P earnings by $423 million ($685 million before
    income taxes) in 2008.

Production and sales volumes:

The
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was
    418,000 boepd in 2010 compared with 408,000 boepd in 2009 and
    381,000 boepd in 2008. Approximately 73% in 2010, 72% in 2009
    and 70% in 2008 of the Corporation’s production was from
    crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently
    estimates that its 2011 production will average between 415,000
    and 425,000 boepd, after a reduction of approximately 4,000
    boepd due to drilling delays at the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of
    Mexico as well as the effect of the sale in February 2011 of
    natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea.



The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as
    follows:

Reflects natural gas production
    converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf
    equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not
    necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price
    of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been
    substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil
    over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the
    table above.

United States:

Crude oil and natural
    gas production in the United States was higher in 2010 compared
    with 2009, primarily due to production from the Shenzi, Llano,
    Conger and Bakken fields. Crude oil and natural gas production
    was higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to new
    production from the Shenzi Field and production resuming after
    the 2008 hurricanes. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008
    production by an estimated 7,000 boepd.

Europe:

Crude oil production was higher
    in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia
    and an increase in Norway following the acquisition of
    additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields, partially
    offset by lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea
    following the exchange of Clair for additional Norway interests.
    Crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher
    production in Russia offset lower production in the United
    Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2010
    compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United
    Kingdom gas fields. Natural gas production was lower in 2009
    compared with 2008, primarily due to decline and subsequent
    cessation of production at the Atlantic and Cromarty fields.

Africa:

Crude oil production decreased
    in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for
    additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway in
    the third quarter and lower entitlement to Algerian production.
    Crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008,
    primarily due to lower production from the Ceiba Field.

Asia and other:

Natural gas production
    in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the
    Pangkah Field and a temporary shut-in at the Bumi Field in the
    Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas
    production in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a
    full year of Phase 2 sales from JDA. The decrease in crude oil
    production in 2010 from 2009 principally reflects changes to the
    Corporation’s entitlement to production in Azerbaijan.



Sales volumes:

Higher sales volumes and
    other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately
    $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and
    $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008.

Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and
    amortization:

Cash operating costs,
    consisting of production expenses and general and administrative
    expenses, increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with
    2009 and decreased by $114 million in 2009 compared with
    2008. The increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due
    to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices.
    The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to
    lower production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices),
    the cessation of production at several United Kingdom North Sea
    fields, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost
    savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher
    production volumes.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by
    $109 million in 2010 and $191 million in 2009,
    compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The
    increases in both 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to higher
    production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher
    finding and development costs.

Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash
    operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.45 in
    2010, $13.70 in 2009 and $15.49 in 2008. Cash operating costs in
    2011 are estimated to be in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per
    barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation, depletion and
    amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.56 in
    2010, $14.19 in 2009 and $13.79 in 2008. Depreciation, depletion
    and amortization costs for 2011 are estimated to be in the range
    of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent.

Effective December 31, 2009, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) issued updated standards for oil and gas
    reserve estimation and disclosure. The new rules allow, among
    other changes, the use of permitted technology in determining
    oil and gas reserve estimates. Since it was not practical to
    calculate reserve estimates under both the old and the new
    reserve estimation standards, it was not possible to precisely
    measure the effect of adopting the new SEC requirements on total
    proved reserves at December 31, 2009. However, the
    Corporation estimates that applying the new rules increased
    income during 2010 by approximately $80 million, after
    income taxes, due to lower depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense.

Exploration expenses:

Exploration
    expenses increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher
    lease amortization. Exploration expenses increased in 2009
    compared to 2008, mainly due to higher dry hole costs and lease
    amortization.

Income taxes:

Excluding the impact of
    items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates
    for E&P operations were 44% in 2010, 48% in 2009 and 49% in
    2008. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in
    2011 is estimated to be in the range of 45% to 49%.

Foreign Exchange:

The after-tax foreign
    currency losses were $9 million in 2010, $10 million
    in 2009 and $80 million in 2008. The foreign currency loss
    in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate
    movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of
    assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by
    certain foreign businesses.

Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting
    comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes:

2010:

The Corporation completed the exchange
    of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the
    United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%,
    respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This
    non-monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value,
    resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,150 million
    ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also
    completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural
    gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of
    $58 million.

The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million
    ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the
    carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Med Block,
    located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and
    included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
    prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently
    explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery,
    conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the
    Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement.
    In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the
    Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration
    activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block.
    As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value
    of its interests in the West Med Block.

The Corporation recorded $101 million ($64 million
    after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously
    suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and
    Block BM-S-22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior
    to 2010.

2009:

The U.S. Supreme Court decided it
    would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of
    Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service
    (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
    Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the
    Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the
    Corporation recognized after-tax income of $89 million to
    reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods
    from 2003 to 2009. The pre-tax amount of $143 million was
    reported in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of
    $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce
    the carrying value of two-short lived fields in the United
    Kingdom North Sea.

Pre-tax charges of approximately $25 million
    ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair
    the carrying values of production equipment and to write down
    materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United
    States. The pre-tax amount of most of the inventory write downs
    was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of
    Consolidated Income.

2008:

Pre-tax charges of $30 million
    ($17 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair
    the carrying values of mature fields in the United States and
    the United Kingdom North Sea.

Pre-tax charges of $15 million ($9 million after
    income taxes) were recorded to expense costs associated with
    Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico. The pre-tax
    amount of the charges totaling $15 million were reported in
    Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

The Corporation’s future E&P earnings may be impacted
    by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of
    crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes,
    exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in
    foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of
    weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic
    risk. In addition, as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the
    BP operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have
    been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations
    that could impact the Corporation’s future drilling
    operations and increase its potential liability in the event of
    an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks
    that may affect the Corporation’s E&P business, see
    Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and
    Operations.

Marketing
    and Refining

Earnings (losses) from M&R activities amounted to
    $(231) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and
    $277 million in 2008. Excluding the items affecting
    comparability reflected in the table on page 25 and
    discussed below, the earnings were $58 million,
    $115 million and $277 million, respectively.



Refining:

Refining earnings (losses),
    which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
    results, Port Reading earnings and results of other
    miscellaneous operating activities, were $(445) million in
    2010 (including the $289 million after-tax impairment
    charge discussed below), $(87) million in 2009 (including a
    benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment) and
    $73 million in 2008.

In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge
    of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million
    after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity
    investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from
    equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. The investment had been
    adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses
    resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery
    utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As
    a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA decided to
    lower crude oil refining capacity from 500,000 to
    350,000 barrels per day. The Corporation performed an
    impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had
    experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For
    discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 4, Refining Joint
    Venture in the notes to the financial statements on page 59. As
    a result of cumulative net operating losses in the last two
    years, the Corporation is not recognizing a full income tax
    benefit on the impairment charge.

The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a
    loss of $138 million in 2010 ($222 million before
    income taxes) excluding the impairment charge, a loss of
    $142 million ($229 million before income taxes) in
    2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million before
    income taxes) in 2008. These results reflect lower refining
    margins and lower sales volumes. The 2010 and 2009 utilization
    rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins and planned
    and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization rates also
    reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. During
    2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down
    for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporation’s share of
    HOVENSA’s turnaround expenses was approximately
    $20 million after income taxes.

Other after-tax refining results, principally from Port Reading
    operations, were a loss of $18 million in 2010 and income
    of $43 million in both 2009 and 2008. During 2010, the Port
    Reading refining facility was shutdown for 41 days for a
    scheduled turnaround. The after-tax expenses for the Port
    Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The
    turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses, in
    the Statement of Consolidated Income.

In January 2011, HOVENSA announced plans to shut down certain
    older and smaller processing units on the west side of its
    refinery, which will reduce the refinery’s crude oil
    distillation capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per
    day, with no impact on the capacity of its coker or FCC unit.
    This reconfiguration, which is expected to be completed in the
    first quarter of 2011, is being undertaken to improve
    efficiency, reliability and competitiveness.

Marketing:

Marketing operations, which
    consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing
    activities, generated income of $215 million in 2010,
    $168 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2008. The
    increase in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 reflects
    improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
    derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
    its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
    trading activities, including its share of the results of the
    trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $1 million in
    2010, earnings of $46 million in 2009 and a loss of
    $36 million in 2008.

Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009 and
    decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008, principally reflecting
    changes in retail credit card fees.

The Corporation’s future M&R earnings may be impacted
    by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit
    risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions,
    political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a
    more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the
    Corporation’s M&R business, see Item 1A. Risk
    Factors Related to Our Business and Operations.

Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the
    increase in corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009
    primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs, and bank
    facility fees. The decrease in corporate expenses in 2009
    compared with 2008 primarily reflects gains on supplemental
    pension related investments and lower employee and professional
    costs. After-tax corporate expenses in 2011 are estimated to be
    in the range of $165 to $175 million.

In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre-tax charges of
    $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related
    to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed-rate notes that
    were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million
    ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement
    benefits and employee severance costs. In 2010, the Corporation
    recorded a pre-tax charge of $11 million ($7 million
    after income taxes) related to the repurchase of the remaining
    $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in
    2011. The pre-tax charges in connection with the debt
    repurchases were recorded in Other, net, and the pre-tax amounts
    of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in
    General and administrative expenses within the Statement of
    Consolidated Income.

Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. The increase
    in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects
    higher debt and fees for letters of credit. After-tax interest
    expense in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $240 to
    $250 million.

Sales
    and Other Operating Revenues

Sales and other operating revenues totaled $33,862 million
    in 2010, $29,614 million in 2009 and $41,134 million
    in 2008. In 2010, sales and other operating revenues increased
    by 14% compared with 2009. In 2009, sales and other operating
    revenues decreased by 28% compared with 2008. The fluctuations
    in each year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined
    product selling prices.

The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally
    reflects the change in sales volumes and purchase prices of
    refined products, natural gas and electricity.

    Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and
    additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod
    fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash.

Capital expenditures in 2009 include acquisitions of
    $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million
    for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which
    are adjacent to Block

of the
    JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for
    leasehold acquisitions in the United States and
    $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5%
    interest in the Corporation’s Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008,
    the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing
    business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity
    customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an
    aggregate of approximately $100 million.

Financing Activities:

During 2010, net
    proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million. In August
    2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year
    fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in
    2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in
    the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod
    fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the
    repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were
    scheduled to mature in 2011. During 2009, net proceeds from
    borrowings were $447 million, compared with net repayments
    of debt of $32 million in 2008.

Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million in 2010
    and 2009 and $130 million in 2008. The Corporation received
    net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including
    related income tax benefits of $54 million,
    $18 million and $340 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Future
    Capital Requirements and Resources

The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately
    $5.6 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during
    2011, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P
    operations. In the Corporation’s M&R operations,
    refining margins continue to be weak, which have adversely
    affected HOVENSA’s liquidity position. The Corporation
    intends to provide its share of financial support for HOVENSA.
    The Corporation expects to fund its 2011 operations, including
    capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions, required
    debt repayments and financial support for HOVENSA, with existing
    cash on-hand, cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale
    of United Kingdom natural gas assets and its available credit
    facilities. Crude oil prices, natural gas prices and refining
    margins are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition,
    unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital
    expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change,
    such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an
    unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation
    would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may
    pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of
    debt securities, the issuance of equity securities,

and/or

asset
    sales.

The Corporation has a $3 billion syndicated revolving
    credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings
    and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed
    through May 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation has
    available capacity on the facility of $3 billion.

The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility
    securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing
    and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing
    arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue
    letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the
    availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At
    December 31, 2010, outstanding letters of credit under this
    facility were collateralized by a total of $1,194 million
    of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned
    subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the
    general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the
    outstanding obligations under the asset-backed facility.

The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may
    issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
    preferred stock.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a
    financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings
    and secured debt. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation is
    permitted to borrow up to an additional $22.4 billion for
    the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has
    the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.4 billion of
    secured debt at December 31, 2010.

The Corporation’s $2,082 million in letters of credit
    outstanding at December 31, 2010 were primarily issued to
    satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 16, Risk
    Management and Trading Activities.

Credit
    Ratings

There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the
    Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently
    assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the
    Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees
    charged on some of the Corporation’s credit facilities, as
    well as margin requirements from risk management and trading
    counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the
    Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation intends to
    continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA.
    Estimated future purchases amount to approximately
    $5 billion annually using year-end 2010 prices, which have
    been included in the table through 2015.

In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
    commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
    HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
    sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future
    supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market
    prices, actual refinery output and the amount of product sold by
    HOVENSA to unaffiliated third parties. Under the product sales
    agreement between the Corporation and HOVENSA, HOVENSA is
    entitled to reserve refined products for sale to unaffiliated
    third parties each month up to a maximum amount set by the
    executive committee of HOVENSA annually. The Corporation is
    obligated to purchase 50% of the remaining refined products
    produced by HOVENSA, including amounts reserved for third party
    sales by HOVENSA that remain unsold. The prices at which the
    Corporation purchases refined products are determined by
    reference to published market prices prevailing at the time of
    purchase. The amount of the purchase commitment from HOVENSA is
    based on the forecasted refinery output that is expected to be
    sold to the Corporation calculated using year-end prices.

Also included above are term purchase agreements at market
    prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the
    Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for
    the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation
    has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and
    electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy
    marketing business. These commitments were computed based
    predominately on year-end market prices.

The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including
    the portion of the Corporation’s planned $5.6 billion
    capital investment program for 2011 that is contractually
    committed at December 31, 2010. Obligations for operating
    expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic
    purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal
    business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect
    contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2010, including asset retirement obligations,
    pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for
    uncertain income tax positions.

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline
    stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets
    for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating
    leases.

As of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has a contingent
    purchase obligation, expiring in April 2012, to acquire the
    remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint
    venture, for approximately $190 million.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
    HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other
    than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee
    fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and
    related prices and at December 31, 2010 it amounted to
    $150 million. In addition, the Corporation



has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of
    $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to
    meet its senior debt obligations.

The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit
    and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly
    related to its business at December 31, 2010 as shown below
    (in millions):

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance
    sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
    Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is
    $394 million at December 31, 2010 compared with
    $412 million at December 31, 2009. The
    Corporation’s December 31, 2010 debt to capitalization
    ratio would increase from 24.9% to 26.2% if these leases were
    included as debt.

See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 17,
    Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial
    statements.

Foreign
    Operations

The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities
    outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia,
    Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt,
    Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia,
    Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.
    Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated
    with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law
    changes, and currency risk.

See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and
    Operations.

Accounting
    Policies

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
    assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
    accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and
    various financial statement ratios. However, the
    Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change
    cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of
    injected
    CO


for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
    after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
    producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operational
    viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not
    met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or
    operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs
    are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in
    assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a
    project include: commitment of project personnel, active
    negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations
    with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for
    additional drilling and other factors.



Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:

The
    SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure
    requirements effective for year-end 2009 reporting. In addition,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its
    accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and
    disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a
    significant element in arriving at the results of operations of
    exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved
    reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production
    depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment,
    as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.

For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with
    reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known
    reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods
    and government regulations. In addition, government and project
    operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount
    of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors
    must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its
    own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical
    staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The
    Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates
    throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells,
    performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To
    provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve
    estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and
    approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are
    subject to internal technical audits and senior management
    review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party
    consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the
    Corporation’s total proved reserves.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
    Goodwill:

As explained below there are
    significant differences in the way long-lived assets and
    goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas
    fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable
    cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
    other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the
    long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by
    undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are
    impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
    impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
    generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash
    flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
    net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
    future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
    historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
    projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted
    rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves,
    including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a
    stipulated amount of capital expenditures.

The production volumes, prices and timing of production are
    consistent with internal projections and other externally
    reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining
    asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the
    standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since
    the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve
    month average prices.

The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P
    producing assets are based on its best estimates of future
    production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices,
    operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and
    other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is
    performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the
    projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease,
    crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly
    for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating
    costs increase significantly.

The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment at a
    reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level
    below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted
    annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill
    may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to
    evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined
    primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The
    Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the E&P
    operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill
    will be recovered through the operation of that segment.

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the E&P
    segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash
    flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the
    estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and
    (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price
    an acquirer would pay for potential



synergies including cost savings, access to new business
    opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and
    increased market share. The Corporation also considers the
    relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production
    companies.

The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment
    depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices,
    timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant
    extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced
    reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of
    the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of
    goodwill.

As there are significant differences in the way long-lived
    assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
    testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
    would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the
    E&P segment.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The
    Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The
    fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is
    based on quoted market prices, where available, or other
    valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
    Differences between the carrying value of the Corporation’s
    equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the
    affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over
    the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets.

Income Taxes:

Judgments are required in
    the determination and recognition of income tax assets and
    liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include
    the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect
    of a tax position when management believes that it is more
    likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the
    position will be sustained upon examination.

The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit
    carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United
    States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses
    and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax
    assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and
    tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments
    are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being
    realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
    is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that
    is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of
    deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal
    periods for available carryforward periods for net operating
    losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the
    availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of
    appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and
    other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on
    assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are
    consistent with the Corporation’s internal business
    forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which
    have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in
    consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and
    equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The
    amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany
    transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through
    depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these
    assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed
    earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely
    reinvested in foreign operations.

Fair Value Measurements:

The
    Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental
    pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with
    changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other
    comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation
    uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value,
    including the market and income approaches. The
    Corporation’s fair value measurements also include
    non-performance risk and time value of money considerations.
    Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and
    the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued
    liabilities.

The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted
    accounting principles. These fair value measurements are
    recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial
    recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment
    of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.

The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the
    FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which
    established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure the fair
    value of financial asset and liabilities based on the source of
    the input, which generally range from quoted prices for
    identical instruments in a principal



trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using
    related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used
    to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based
    on the lowest significant input level within this fair value
    hierarchy.

Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the
    fair values are as follows

:

Fair value measurements based on Level 1
    inputs:

Measurements that are most observable
    are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained
    from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing
    prices are both readily available and representative of fair
    value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and
    volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the
    Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are
    considered Level 1.

Fair value measurements based on Level 2
    inputs:

Measurements derived indirectly from
    observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are
    less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on
    Level 2 inputs include

over-the-counter

derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded
    curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to
    exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value
    measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards,
    swaps and options. The liability related to the
    Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as
    Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3
    inputs:

Measurements that are least
    observable are estimated from related market data determined
    from sources with little or no market activity for comparable
    contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example,
    in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural
    gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure
    by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales
    and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid
    delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair
    values determined using discounted cash flows and other
    unobservable data are also classified as Level 3.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both risk management and trading
    activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency
    exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation,
    principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy
    commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards,
    options and swaps, based on expectations of future market
    conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are
    recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated
    as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted
    transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments
    (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is
    recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).
    Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in
    the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
    The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in
    earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The
    change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is
    recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized
    currently in earnings.

Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair
    value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before
    they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on
    an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify
    for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective
    effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical
    simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical
    observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot
    prices.

Retirement Plans:

The Corporation has
    funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an
    unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes
    on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the
    projected benefit obligation for these plans.



The determination of the obligations and expenses related to
    these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most
    significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring
    the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term
    rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in
    compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made
    by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external
    factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the
    Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a
    portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with
    maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan
    obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is
    developed from the expected future returns for each asset
    category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to
    that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a
    material impact on the amounts reported in the
    Corporation’s financial statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation
    recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset
    retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any
    legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is
    recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
    Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the
    carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which
    the liability is incurred. In order to measure these
    obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the
    obligations by discounting the future payments that will be
    required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these
    estimates, the Corporation is required to make several
    assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement,
    timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements,
    inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are
    other external factors which could significantly affect the
    ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including:
    changes in environmental regulations and other statutory
    requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign
    currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a
    result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement
    obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described
    above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in
    adjustments to both the liability and related asset values.

Changes
    in Accounting Policies

Effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted the
    amended accounting standards that eliminated the consolidation
    exception for a qualifying special-purpose entity and changed
    the analysis necessary to determine whether consolidation of a
    variable interest entity is required. The adoption of these
    standards resulted in an increase of approximately
    $10 million to Property, plant and equipment and a
    corresponding increase to Long-term debt. The debt was
    subsequently repaid during the first quarter of 2010.

Effective December 31, 2009, the FASB adopted Accounting
    Standards Update (ASU) Extractive Activities — Oil and
    Gas (ASC 932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and
    Disclosures, which amended the requirements for oil and gas
    reserve estimation and disclosures. The main provisions of the
    ASU, which align accounting standards with the previously issued
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements, expand
    the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include
    the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil
    or gas, to change the price assumption used for reserve
    estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from
    the year-end price and to amend the geographic disclosure
    requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil
    and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these
    disclosures.

Environment,
    Health and Safety

The Corporation has a values-based, socially-responsible
    strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety
    performance and making a positive impact on communities where it
    does business. The strategy is reflected in the
    Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social
    responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment
    and safety management systems that help protect the
    Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities.
    The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold
    or exceed international standards and are intended to promote
    internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and
    continual improvement in EHS & SR performance.
    Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the
    Corporation’s operating costs and could also require
    increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to
    assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to
    enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity
    and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral
    benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation
    has programs in place to evaluate



regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees,
    prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet
    corporate EHS & SR goals.

The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation
    distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and
    localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur
    content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold
    within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require
    capital expenditures by the Corporation and HOVENSA to meet the
    required sulfur content standards or other changes in the
    marketing of fuel oils.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries
    covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on
    the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of
    the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has
    previously installed more advanced pollution controls. In
    January 2011, HOVENSA signed a Consent Decree with EPA to
    resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree,
    HOVENSA will pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and
    spend approximately $700 million over the next
    10 years to install equipment and implement additional
    operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce
    emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to
    spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental
    project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands
    and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power
    Authority with monitoring. The Consent Decree has been lodged
    with the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands and
    approval is pending. In addition, substantial progress has been
    made towards resolving this matter for the Port Reading refining
    facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse
    impact on the Corporation’s financial position or results
    of operations.

The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and
    reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon
    dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate
    change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is
    committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas
    emissions from our existing assets and future developments and
    is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions.

The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for
    environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective
    action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals,
    onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries
    (including solid waste management units under permits issued
    pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and,
    although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites
    where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible
    party.

The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
    remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable. At year-end 2010, the Corporation’s
    reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately
    $55 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves
    for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to
    assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s
    remediation spending was $13 million in 2010 and
    $11 million in both 2009 and 2008. Capital expenditures for
    facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local
    environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur
    requirements, were approximately $85 million in 2010,
    $50 million in 2009 and $15 million in 2008.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
    to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
    natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
    changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
    disclosures that follow, these risk management activities are
    referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management.
    The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through
    a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades
    energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are
    also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices
    of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following
    describes how these risks are controlled and managed.

Controls:

The Corporation maintains a
    control environment under the direction of its chief risk
    officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the
    Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls
    include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief
    risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or
    commodities. Risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to
    business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s
    risk management department also performs independent
    verifications of sources of fair values and validations of
    valuation models. These controls apply to all of the
    Corporation’s risk management and trading activities,
    including the consolidated trading partnership. The
    Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for
    administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging
    programs.

The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control
    commodity risk within its trading and risk management
    activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation
    and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over
    one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first
    and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary
    from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or
    hedging levels change in risk management activities.

Instruments:

The Corporation primarily
    uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward
    contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based
    securities in its risk management and trading activities. These
    contracts are generally widely traded instruments with
    standardized terms. The following describes these instruments
    and how the Corporation uses them:

•

Forward Commodity Contracts:

The Corporation
    enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of
    commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the
    contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity.
    Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale
    contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk
    disclosures.

•

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:

The
    Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the
    British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to
    buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a
    predetermined exchange rate on a future date.

•

Exchange Traded Contracts:

The Corporation
    uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number
    of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are
    settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to
    exchange position limits.

•

Swaps:

The Corporation uses financially
    settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk
    management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap
    contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or
    interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the
    contract.

•

Options:

Options on various underlying energy
    commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts
    and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the
    Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk
    of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying
    the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a
    premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the
    favorable price movements in the underlying commodities.



•

Energy Securities:

Energy securities include
    energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or
    government or related derivatives on these securities.

Risk
    Management Activities

Energy marketing activities:

In its
    energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to
    commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating
    prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as
    futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical
    assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce
    margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with
    customers.

Corporate risk management:

Corporate
    risk management activities include transactions designed to
    reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined products
    or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure
    to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally,
    futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk
    in the selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s
    crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also
    be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation
    does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign
    currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used,
    generally to convert

fixed-rate

interest payments to floating.

The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
    exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
    formal contracts for various currencies including the British
    Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts
    maturing in 2011 with a fair value of $7 million. The
    change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a
    10% strengthening of the US Dollar exchange rate is
    estimated to be an approximately $88 million loss at
    December 31, 2010.

The Corporation’s fixed-rate debt of $5,569 million
    has a fair value of $6,353 million at December 31,
    2010. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the
    fair value of debt by approximately $147 million at
    December 31, 2010.

Following is the value at risk for the Corporation’s energy

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
    as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
    on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2010.

The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness
    of the Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, as stated in their
    report, which is included herein.

    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010 based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
    related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and
    equity and comprehensive income of Hess Corporation and
    consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated
    February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the
    “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows,
    and equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also
    included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
    consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Corporation adopted new oil and gas reserve
    estimation and disclosure requirements effective
    December 31, 2009.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hess
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:

Hess Corporation
    and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) engage in the exploration
    for and the development, production, purchase, transportation
    and sale of crude oil and natural gas. These activities are
    conducted principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil,
    Brunei, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea,
    France, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia,
    Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition,
    the Corporation manufactures refined petroleum products and
    purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products,
    natural gas and electricity. The Corporation owns 50% of HOVENSA
    L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a refinery joint venture in the United States
    Virgin Islands. An additional refining facility, terminals and
    retail gasoline stations, most of which include convenience
    stores, are located on the East Coast of the United States.

In preparing financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
    management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses in the income statement. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Among the estimates
    made by management are oil and gas reserves, asset valuations,
    depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental
    obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes.
    Certain information in the financial statements and notes has
    been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
    In the preparation of these financial statements, the
    Corporation has evaluated subsequent events through the date of
    issuance.

Principles of Consolidation:

The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess
    Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
    a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
    The Corporation consolidates the trading partnership in which it
    owns a 50% voting interest and over which it exercises control.
    The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
    and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
    consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50%
    owned and where the Corporation has the ability to influence the
    operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, including
    HOVENSA, are accounted for using the equity method.

Revenue Recognition:

The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas,
    petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to
    the customer. Sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes
    in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas
    properties based on sales to customers. Differences between
    Exploration and Production (E&P) natural gas volumes sold
    and the Corporation’s share of natural gas production are
    not material. Revenues from natural gas and electricity sales by
    the Corporation’s marketing operations are recognized based
    on meter readings and estimated deliveries to customers since
    the last meter reading.

In its E&P activities, the Corporation engages in crude oil
    purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that
    are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary
    purpose of changing location or quality. Similarly, in its
    marketing activities, the Corporation enters into refined
    product purchase and sale transactions with the same
    counterparty. These arrangements are reported net in Sales and
    other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both risk management and trading
    activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices
    of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as
    well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
    In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a
    consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives,
    including futures, forwards, options and swaps based on
    expectations of future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are
    recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated
    as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted
    transactions (cash flow hedges)



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective
    portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of
    other comprehensive income (loss) while the ineffective portion
    of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings.
    Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in
    the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
    Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value
    hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair
    value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an
    adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in
    earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
    equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are
    readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three
    months or less when acquired.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at
    the lower of cost or market. For refined product inventories
    valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) inventory method. For the remaining
    inventories, cost is generally determined using average actual
    costs.

Exploration and Development
    Costs:

E&P activities are accounted for
    using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved
    and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease
    bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are
    capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and
    exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of
    drilling and equipping productive wells, including development
    dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In
    production operations, costs of injected
    CO


for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
    after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
    producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operational
    viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not
    met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or
    operational viability of a project, the capitalized well costs
    are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in
    assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a
    project include commitment of project personnel, active
    negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations
    with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for
    additional drilling and other factors.

Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization:

The Corporation records
    depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties
    using the units of production method over proved oil and gas
    reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas
    production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of
    production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves.
    Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are
    based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of
    all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line
    method based on estimated useful lives. Retail gas stations and
    equipment related to a leased property, are depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives not to exceed the remaining lease period.
    The Corporation records the cost of acquired customers in its
    energy marketing activities as intangible assets and amortizes
    these costs on the straight-line method over the expected
    renewal period based on historical experience.

Capitalized Interest:

Interest from
    external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using
    the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the
    project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
    use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from
    the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful
    lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of
    the underlying assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. The Corporation
    recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required
    asset retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets
    in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred.
    In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional
    asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be
    reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes the associated
    asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the
    long-lived assets.



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts are not
    expected to be recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the
    assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The
    amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the
    assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future
    net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the net
    present value of future cash flows is based on management’s
    best estimate of future prices, which is determined with
    reference to recent historical prices and published forward
    prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted
    at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes
    represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be
    produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.
    The production volumes, prices and timing of production are
    consistent with internal projections and other externally
    reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining
    asset impairments will generally differ from the average prices
    used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
    flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The
    Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The
    fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is
    based on quoted market prices, where available, or other
    valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.
    Differences between the carrying value of the Corporation’s
    equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the
    affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over
    the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets.

Impairment of Goodwill:

Goodwill is
    tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. This impairment
    test is calculated at the reporting unit level, which for the
    Corporation’s goodwill is the Exploration and Production
    operating segment. The Corporation identifies potential
    impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to
    its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not
    impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the
    Corporation calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing
    the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If
    the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying
    amount, an impairment would be recorded.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are
    determined using the liability method. The Corporation regularly
    assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on
    estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax
    planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the
    available carryforward periods for net operating losses and
    other factors. If it is more likely than not that some or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation
    allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the
    amount expected to be realized. In addition, the Corporation
    recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only
    when management believes that it is more likely than not, that
    based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained
    upon examination. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes
    which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated
    in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and
    equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The
    amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany
    transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through
    depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these
    assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed
    earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely
    reinvested in foreign operations. The Corporation classifies
    interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions
    as income tax expense.

Fair Value Measurements:

The
    Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental
    pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with
    changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other
    comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation
    uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value,
    including the market and income approaches. The
    Corporation’s fair value measurements also include
    non-performance risk and time value of money considerations.
    Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and
    the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued
    liabilities.



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair
    value measurements are recorded in connection with business
    combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement
    obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity
    method investments or goodwill.

The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the
    fair value measurements accounting standard which established a
    hierarchy for the inputs used to measure the fair value of
    financial assets and liabilities based on the source of the
    input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical
    instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to
    estimates determined using related market data (Level 3).
    Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the
    level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input
    level within this fair value hierarchy.

Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the
    fair values are as follows

:

Fair value measurements based on Level 1
    inputs:

Measurements that are most observable
    are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained
    from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing
    prices are both readily available and representative of fair
    value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and
    volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the
    Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are
    considered Level 1.

Fair value measurements based on Level 2
    inputs:

Measurements derived indirectly from
    observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are
    less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on
    Level 2 inputs include

over-the-counter

derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded
    curve, but have contractual terms that are not identical to
    exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value
    measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards,
    swaps and options. The liability related to the
    Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as
    Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3
    inputs:

Measurements that are least
    observable are estimated from related market data, determined
    from sources with little or no market activity for comparable
    contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example,
    in its energy marketing business, the Corporation enters into
    contracts to sell natural gas and electricity to customers and
    offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The
    fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific
    prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified
    as Level 3. There may be offsets to these positions that
    are priced based on more liquid markets, which are, therefore,
    classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Fair values
    determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable
    data are also classified as Level 3.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Corporation applied the
    provisions of a new accounting standard for the accounting for
    liabilities measured at fair value with a third-party credit
    enhancement (ASC 820 — Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures, originally issued as Emerging Issues Task Force

08-5,

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
    with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement). Upon adoption, the
    Corporation revalued certain derivative liabilities
    collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the
    Corporation’s credit rating rather than the credit rating
    of the issuing bank. The adoption resulted in an increase in
    Sales and other operating revenues of approximately
    $13 million and an increase in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income of approximately $78 million, with a
    corresponding decrease in derivative liabilities recorded within
    Accounts payable.

Retirement Plans:

The Corporation
    recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement
    plans on the balance sheet. The funded status is measured as the
    difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
    projected benefit obligation. The Corporation recognizes the net
    changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which
    such changes occur. Prior service costs and actuarial gains and
    losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation
    or the market value of assets are amortized over the average
    remaining service period of active employees.

Share-Based Compensation:

The fair
    value of all share-based compensation is expensed and recognized
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The
    U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in
    which business is conducted) for most foreign operations.
    Adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and
    liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency
    into the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the
    Statement of Consolidated Income. For operations that do not use
    the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency, adjustments
    resulting from translating foreign currency assets and
    liabilities into U.S. Dollars are recorded in a separate
    component of equity titled Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss).

Maintenance and Repairs:

Maintenance
    and repairs are expensed as incurred, including costs of
    refinery turnarounds. Capital improvements are recorded as
    additions in Property, plant and equipment.

Environmental Expenditures:

The
    Corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs to
    remediate existing conditions related to past operations when
    the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The
    Corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase
    the life or efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent
    future adverse impacts to the environment.

Changes in Accounting
    Policies:

Effective January 1, 2010, the
    Corporation adopted the amended accounting standards that
    eliminated the consolidation exception for a qualifying
    special-purpose entity and changed the analysis necessary to
    determine whether consolidation of a variable interest entity is
    required. The adoption of these standards resulted in an
    increase of approximately $10 million to Property, plant
    and equipment and a corresponding increase to Long-term debt.
    The debt was subsequently repaid during the first quarter of
    2010.

Effective December 31, 2009, the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
    Extractive Activities — Oil and Gas (ASC 932) Oil
    and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures, which amended the
    requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures.
    The main provisions of the ASU, which align accounting standards
    with the previously issued Securities and Exchange Commission
    (SEC) requirements, expand the definition of oil and gas
    producing activities to include the extraction of resources
    which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change the price
    assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to
    a twelve month average from the year-end price and to amend the
    geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and
    other supplementary oil and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil
    and Gas Data for these disclosures.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

2010:

In December, the Corporation
    acquired approximately 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil
    shale play (Bakken) in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for
    $1,075 million in cash. In December, the Corporation also
    completed the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc.
    (American Oil & Gas) for approximately
    $675 million through the issuance of approximately
    8.6 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock,
    which increased the Corporation’s acreage position in the
    Bakken by approximately 85,000 net acres. The properties
    acquired are located near the Corporation’s existing
    acreage. These acquisitions strengthen the Corporation’s
    acreage position in the Bakken, leverage existing capabilities
    and infrastructure and are expected to contribute to future
    reserve and production growth. Both of these transactions were
    accounted for as business combinations and the majority of the
    fair value of the assets acquired was assigned to unproved
    properties. The total goodwill recorded on these transactions
    was $347 million. The preliminary purchase price
    allocations are subject to normal post-closing adjustments.

In September, the Corporation completed the exchange of its
    interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for
    additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the
    Valhall and Hod fields offshore Norway. This non-monetary
    exchange was accounted for as a business combination and was
    recorded at fair value. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax
    gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income
    taxes). The total combined carrying amount of the disposed
    assets prior to the exchange was $702 million, including
    goodwill of $65 million. The Corporation also acquired,
    from a different third party, additional interests of 8% and 13%
    in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for
    $507 million in cash. This acquisition was accounted for as
    a business combination. As a result of both of these
    transactions, the Corporation’s total interests in the
    Valhall and Hod fields are 64% and 63%, respectively. The
    primary

For all 2010 acquisitions and the exchange described above, the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair
    value. The estimated fair value of the property, plant and
    equipment acquired in the transactions described above was
    primarily based on an income approach. The significant inputs
    used in this Level 3 fair value measurement include assumed
    future production and capital based on anticipated development
    plans, commodity prices, costs and a risk-adjusted discount
    rate. The goodwill recorded equals the deferred tax liability
    recognized for the differences in book and tax bases of the
    assets acquired. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible
    for income tax purposes.

In January, the Corporation completed the sale of its interest
    in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia
    (Hess 25%) for cash proceeds of $183 million. The
    transaction resulted in a gain of $58 million, after
    deducting the net book value of assets including goodwill of
    $7 million.

2009:

The Corporation acquired for
    $74 million a 50% interest in Blocks PM301 and PM302 in
    Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block

A-18

of the
    Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA) and contain an
    extension of the Bumi Field. The Corporation also acquired 37
    previously leased retail gasoline stations, primarily through
    the assumption of $65 million of fixed-rate notes.

2008:

The Corporation acquired the
    remaining 22% interest in its Gabonese subsidiary for
    $285 million. In addition, the Corporation expanded its
    energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas,
    and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related
    assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million.

Before Virgin Islands income
    taxes, which were recorded in the Corporation’s income tax
    provision. Excludes the impairment charge to reduce the carrying
    value of the Corporation’s equity investment in
    HOVENSA.

In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge
    of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million
    after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity
    investment in HOVENSA to its fair value, which was recorded in
    Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. The
    investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual
    operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins
    and refinery utilization and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating
    downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010,
    HOVENSA decided to lower crude oil refining capacity from
    500,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. The Corporation
    performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its
    investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in
    value. The fair value was determined based on an income approach
    using estimated refined product

selling prices and volumes, related costs of product sold,
    capital and operating expenditures and a market based discount
    rate (Level 3 fair value measurement). As a result of cumulative
    net operating losses in the last two years, the Corporation is
    not recognizing a full income tax benefit on the impairment
    charge.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value
    of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers
    other than PDVSA. The guarantee amounted to $150 million at
    December 31, 2010. This amount fluctuates based on the
    volume of crude oil purchased and the related crude oil prices.
    In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to
    $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to
    meet its senior debt obligations.

Asset
    Impairments

During 2010, the Corporation recorded a charge of
    $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to
    fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West
    Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med Block), located
    offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included
    four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
    prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently
    explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery,
    conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the
    Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement.
    In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the
    Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration
    activities on the block and to relinquish a significant portion
    of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the
    carrying value of its interests in the West Med Block. The

In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of
    30 year fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to
    mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional
    acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall
    and Hod fields.

In December 2009, the Corporation issued $750 million of
    30 year fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 6% and tendered
    for the $662 million of notes due in August 2011. The
    Corporation completed the purchase of $546 million of the
    2011 notes in 2009 and recorded a charge of $54 million
    ($34 million after income taxes). The remaining
    $116 million of the 2011 notes, classified as short-term
    debt and current maturities of long term debt at
    December 31, 2009, was redeemed in January 2010, resulting
    in a charge of $11 million ($7 million after income
    taxes). The charges resulting from the repurchase of the notes
    are reported in Other, net within the Statement of Consolidated
    Income.

In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of
    5 year fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 7% and
    $1 billion of 10 year fixed-rate notes with a coupon
    of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt
    under the revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings
    on other credit facilities.

The aggregate long-term debt maturing during the next five years
    is as follows (in millions): 2011 — $32 (included in
    short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt);
    2012 — $35; 2013 — $37; 2014 —
    $341 and 2015 — $4.

At December 31, 2010, the Corporation’s fixed-rate
    notes have a principal amount of $5,300 million
    ($5,271 million net of unamortized discount). Interest
    rates on the outstanding fixed rate notes have a weighted
    average rate of 6.9%.

The Corporation has a $3 billion syndicated revolving
    credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings
    and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed
    through May 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation has
    available capacity on the facility of $3 billion.
    Borrowings under the facility bear interest at 0.4% above the
    London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of 0.1% per annum
    is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate
    and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the
    Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation has a

364-day

asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts
    receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the
    terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the
    ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to
    $1 billion, subject to the availability of sufficient
    levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2010,
    outstanding letters of credit under this facility were
    collateralized by a total of $1,194 million of accounts
    receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. These
    receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of
    the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding
    obligations under the asset-backed facility.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a
    financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings
    and secured debt. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation is
    permitted to borrow up to an additional $22.4 billion for
    the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has
    the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.4 billion of
    secured debt at December 31, 2010.

and $209 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010,
    assuming forfeitures of 2% per year, 13,200,000 outstanding
    options are expected to vest at a weighted average exercise
    price of $55.66 per share. At December 31, 2010, the
    weighted average remaining term of exercisable options was six
    years.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
    fair value of employee stock options. The following weighted

The assumption above for the risk free interest rate is based on
    the expected terms of the options and is obtained from published
    sources. The stock price volatility is determined from
    historical experience using the same period as the expected
    terms of the options. The expected stock option term is based on
    historical exercise patterns and the expected future holding
    period.

In May 2008, shareholders approved the 2008 Long-Term Incentive
    Plan and in May 2010 approved an amendment to the 2008 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan. The Corporation also has stock options
    outstanding under a former plan. At December 31, 2010, the

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency gains (losses) before income taxes amounted to
    $(5) million in 2010, $20 million in 2009 and
    $(212) million in 2008. The foreign currency loss in 2008
    reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements
    in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets,
    liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain
    foreign businesses. The balances in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency
    translation were an increase to stockholders’ equity of
    $12 million at December 31, 2010 and a reduction to
    stockholders’ equity of $18 million at

Retirement
    Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plans for a significant portion of its employees. In
    addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
    plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental
    payments that would have been payable from the
    Corporation’s principal pension plans, were it not for
    limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide
    defined benefits based on years of service and final average
    salary. Additionally, the Corporation maintains an unfunded
    postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to
    certain qualified retirees from ages 55 through 65. The
    measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31.

expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected
    future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target
    allocation of pension assets to that asset category.

The Corporation’s investment strategy is to maximize
    long-term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad
    diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes.
    Asset classes and target allocations are determined by the
    Corporation’s investment committee and include domestic and
    foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including
    hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers
    are prohibited from investing in securities issued by the
    Corporation unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy.
    The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample
    liquidity for benefit payment requirements. The current target
    allocations for plan assets are 50% equity securities, 25% fixed
    income securities (including cash and short-term investment
    funds) and 25% to all other types of investments. Asset
    allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the
    year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target
    levels.

    assets of the funded pension plans as of December 31, 2010

Cash and short-term investment funds consist of cash on hand and
    short-term investment funds. The short-term investment funds
    provide for daily investments and redemptions and are valued and
    carried at a $1 net asset value (NAV) per fund share.

Equities consist of equity securities issued by U.S. and

non-U.S. corporations

as well as commingled investment funds that invest in equity
    securities. Individually held equity securities are traded
    actively on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are
    readily available. Individual equity securities are classified
    as Level 1. Commingled fund values reflect the NAV per fund
    share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the
    underlying securities. Equity commingled funds are classified as
    Level 2.

Fixed income investments consist of securities issued by the
    U.S. government,

non-U.S. governments,

governmental agencies, municipalities and corporations, and
    agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. This
    investment category also includes commingled investment funds
    that invest in fixed income securities. Individual fixed income
    securities are generally priced on the basis of evaluated prices
    from independent pricing services. Such prices are monitored and
    provided by an independent, third-party custodial firm
    responsible for safekeeping plan assets. Individual fixed income
    securities are classified as Level 2 or 3. Commingled fund
    values reflect the NAV per fund share, derived indirectly from
    observable inputs or from quoted prices in less liquid markets
    of the underlying securities. Fixed income commingled funds are
    classified as Level 2.

Other investments consist of exchange-traded real estate
    investment trust securities as well as commingled fund and
    limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity,
    real estate and diversified commodities. Exchange-traded
    securities are classified as Level 1. Commingled fund
    values reflect the NAV per fund share and are classified as
    Level 2 or 3. Private equity and real estate limited
    partnership values reflect information reported by the fund
    managers, which include inputs such as cost, operating results,
    discounted future cash flows, market based comparable data and
    independent appraisals from third-party sources with
    professional qualifications. Hedge funds, private equity and
    non-exchange-traded real estate investments are classified as

    net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits in the United
    States during 2009 and 2010, resulting from intercompany
    transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of
    property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated
    group. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation has recognized
    a gross deferred tax asset, before application of valuation
    allowance, of $896 million related to net operating loss
    carryforwards. This is comprised of approximately
    $101 million attributable to United States federal income
    tax which begin to expire in 2020, $165 million
    attributable to various states which begin to expire in 2011,
    and $630 million attributable to foreign jurisdictions
    which begin to expire in 2020. At December 31, 2010, the
    Corporation has federal, state and foreign alternative minimum
    tax credit carryforwards of approximately $126 million,
    which can be carried forward indefinitely and approximately
    $1 million of other business credit carryforwards. Foreign
    tax credit carryforwards, which expire in 2019, total
    $117 million.

At December 31, 2010, the unrecognized tax benefits include
    $294 million, which if recognized, would affect the
    Corporation’s effective income tax rate. Over the next
    12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount
    of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $40 million
    to $50 million due to settlements with taxing authorities.
    The Corporation had accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $16 million as
    of December 31, 2010 and approximately $17 million as
    of December 31, 2009.

The Corporation has not recognized deferred income taxes for
    that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
    The Corporation had undistributed earnings from foreign
    subsidiaries expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations of approximately $4.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010. If these earnings were not indefinitely
    reinvested, a deferred tax liability of approximately
    $1.6 billion would be recognized, not accounting for the
    potential utilization of foreign tax credits in the United
    States.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in
    the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The
    Corporation is no longer subject to examinations by income tax
    authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2005.

Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2010, 2009 and 2008
    amounted to $1,450 million, $1,177 million and
    $2,420 million, respectively.

Risk
    Management and Trading Activities

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
    to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude
    oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as
    to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
    disclosures that follow these activities are referred to as
    energy marketing and corporate risk management activities. The
    Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a
    50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership, that are
    exposed to commodity price risks primarily related to the prices
    of crude oil, natural gas, electricity, refined products, and
    energy-related securities.

The Corporation maintains a control environment under the
    direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate
    risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has
    approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk
    limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new
    instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and
    reported on daily to business units and to senior management.
    The Corporation’s risk management department also performs
    independent verifications of sources of fair values and
    validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of
    the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities,
    including the consolidated trading partnership. The
    Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for
    administering foreign exchange and interest rate hedging
    programs.

Following is a description of the Corporation’s activities
    that use derivatives as part of their operations and strategies.
    Derivatives include both financial instruments and forward
    purchase and sale contracts. Gross notional

amounts of both long and short positions are presented in the
    volume tables below. These amounts include long and short
    positions that offset in closed positions and have not reached
    contractual maturity. Gross notional amounts do not quantify
    risk or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but
    are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the
    contracts.

Energy Marketing Activities:

In its
    energy marketing activities the Corporation sells refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to
    commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating
    prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as
    futures, forwards, swaps and options, together with physical
    assets such as storage and pipeline capacity, are used to obtain
    supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to
    sales contracts with customers.

The table below shows the gross volume of the Corporation’s
    energy marketing commodity contracts outstanding:

At December 31,



Commodity Contracts

Crude oil and refined products (millions of barrels)



Natural gas (millions of mcf)

2,210

1,876

Electricity (millions of megawatt hours)



The changes in fair value of certain energy marketing commodity
    contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized
    currently in earnings. Revenues from the sales contracts are
    recognized in Sales and other operating revenues, supply
    contract purchases are recognized in Cost of products sold and
    net settlements from financial derivatives related to these
    energy marketing activities are recognized in Cost of products
    sold. Net realized and unrealized pre-tax gains on derivative
    contracts not designated as hedges amounted to $247 million
    in 2010 and $102 million in 2009.

At December 31, 2010, a portion of energy marketing
    commodity contracts are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge
    variability of expected future cash flows of forecasted supply
    transactions. The length of time over which the Corporation
    hedges exposure to variability in future cash flows is
    predominantly one year or less. For contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2010, the maximum duration was approximately
    three years. The Corporation records the effective portion of
    changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges as a component of
    other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income are reclassified into Cost of
    products sold in the same period that the hedged item is
    recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in
    fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized immediately in Cost
    of products sold.

At December 31, 2010, the after-tax deferred losses
    relating to energy marketing activities recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income were $147 million
    ($303 million at December 31, 2009). The Corporation
    estimates that approximately $104 million of this amount
    will be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months.
    During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Corporation reclassified
    after-tax income (losses) from Accumulated other comprehensive
    income of $(318) million, $(596) million and
    $112 million, respectively. The amount of gain (loss) from
    hedge ineffectiveness reflected in earnings in 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was $2 million, $(2) million and $1 million.
    The fair value of energy marketing cash flow hedge positions
    decreased by $164 million in 2010, $564 million in
    2009 and $255 million in 2008. The pre-tax amount of
    deferred hedge losses is reflected in Accounts payable and the
    related income tax benefits are recorded as Deferred income tax
    assets on the balance sheet.

Corporate Risk Management:

Corporate
    risk management activities include transactions designed to
    reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined products
    or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure
    to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally,
    futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to fix the
    forward selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s
    crude oil, refined products or natural gas

production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase
    certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with
    the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency
    fluctuations. These forward contracts comprise various
    currencies including the British Pound and Thai Baht. Interest
    rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain
    long-term debt from fixed to floating rates.

The table below shows the gross volume of Corporate risk
    management derivative instruments outstanding:

Principally reflects volumes
    associated with the offsetting crude oil positions.

During 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil cash flow
    hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day through 2012, by
    entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty.
    As a result, the valuation of those contracts is no longer
    subject to change due to price fluctuations. There were no other
    open hedges of crude oil or natural gas production at
    December 31, 2010. Hedging activities decreased Exploration
    and Production Sales and other operating revenue by
    $338 million in 2010, $337 million in 2009 and
    $423 million in 2008.

At December 31, 2010, the after-tax deferred losses in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income relating to the closed
    Brent crude oil hedges were $638 million ($941 million
    at December 31, 2009). The Corporation estimates that
    approximately $330 million of this amount will be
    reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months. The
    pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in Accounts
    payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as
    Deferred income tax assets on the balance sheet.

At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had interest rate
    swaps with a gross notional amount of $310 million, which
    were designated as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value
    of interest rate swaps and the hedged fixed-rate debt are
    recorded in Interest expense. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Corporation recorded an increase of
    $8 million in the fair value of interest rate swaps and a
    corresponding increase in the carrying value of the hedged
    fixed-rate debt.

Foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges. Gains
    or losses on foreign exchange contracts are recognized
    immediately in Other, net in Revenues and non-operating income.

Net pre-tax gains (losses) on derivative contracts used for
    Corporate risk management and not designated as hedges amounted
    to the following:

Fair Value Measurements:

The
    Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair
    value measurements accounting standard (ASC 820 — Fair
    Value Measurements and Disclosures), which established a
    hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs, which
    generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in
    a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates
    determined using related market data (Level 3).

When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular
    market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair
    value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. To value
    Level 2 and 3 derivatives the Corporation uses observable
    inputs for similar instruments that are available from
    exchanges, pricing services or broker quotes. These observable
    inputs may be supplemented with other methods, including
    internal extrapolation, that result in the most representative
    prices for instruments with similar characteristics. Multiple
    inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of
    fair value for each financial asset or liability presented below
    is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair
    value hierarchy.

primarily resulted from instruments that became more actively
    traded as they moved closer to maturity. Transfers into
    Level 2 and 3 from Levels 1 and 2, respectively were
    due to the increased significance of the lower level inputs to
    the instrument’s fair value.

In addition to the financial assets and liabilities disclosed in
    the tables above, the Corporation had other short-term financial
    instruments, primarily cash equivalents and accounts receivable
    and payable, for which the carrying value approximated their
    fair value at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
    Fixed-rate, long-term debt had a carrying value of
    $5,569 million compared with a fair value of
    $6,353 million at December 31, 2010, and a carrying
    value of $4,467 million compared with a fair value of

    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Corporation generally enters into master netting
    arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Master
    netting arrangements are standardized contracts that govern all
    specified transactions with the same counterparty and allow the
    Corporation to terminate all contracts upon occurrence of
    certain events, such as a counterparty’s default or
    bankruptcy. Where these arrangements provide the right of offset
    and the Corporation’s intent and practice is to offset
    amounts in the case of contract terminations, the Corporation
    records fair value on a net basis.

Credit Risk:

The Corporation is exposed
    to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain
    counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts
    receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and
    international customer base. The Corporation’s net
    receivables at December 31, 2010 are concentrated with the
    following counterparty and customer industry segments:
    Integrated Oil Companies — 22%, Government
    Entities — 14%, Manufacturing — 10% and
    Services — 10%. The Corporation reduces its risk
    related to certain counterparties by using master netting
    arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters
    of credit. The Corporation records the cash collateral received
    or posted as an offset to the fair value of derivatives executed
    with the same counterparty. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    the Corporation held cash from counterparties of
    $213 million and $317 million, respectively. The
    Corporation posted cash to counterparties at December 31,
    2010 and 2009 of $34 million and $269 million,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had a total of
    $2,082 million of outstanding letters of credit, primarily
    issued to satisfy margin requirements. Certain of the
    Corporation’s agreements also contain contingent collateral
    provisions that could require the Corporation to post additional
    collateral if the Corporation’s credit rating declines. As
    of December 31, 2010, the net liability related to
    derivatives with contingent collateral provisions was
    approximately $1,692 million before cash collateral posted
    of approximately $16 million. At December 31, 2010,
    all three major credit rating agencies that rate the
    Corporation’s debt had assigned an investment grade rating.
    If two of the three agencies were to downgrade the
    Corporation’s rating to below investment grade, as of
    December 31, 2010, the Corporation would be required to
    post additional collateral of approximately $385 million.

17.

Guarantees
    and Contingencies

At December 31, 2010, the Corporation’s guarantees
    include $150 million of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases
    and $15 million of HOVENSA’s senior debt obligations.
    In addition, the Corporation has $81 million in letters of
    credit for which it is contingently liable. As a result, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that the Corporation
    could be required to make under its guarantees is
    $246 million at December 31, 2010 ($236 million
    at December 31, 2009). The Corporation also has a
    contingent purchase obligation expiring in April 2012, to
    acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline
    station joint venture. As of December 31, 2010, the
    estimated value of the purchase obligation is approximately
    $190 million.

The Corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to
    various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
    environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the
    Corporation’s consolidated financial statements when it is
    probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the
    amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is
    only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however,
    the Corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies.

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving
    water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in
    jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE
    and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE,
    including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases
    is that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that
    these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share
    of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and
    are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged
    effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the
    majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In
    2010, additional cases were settled, and three new cases were
    filed. The six unresolved cases consist of five cases that have
    been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the Southern
    District of New York as part of a multi-district litigation
    proceeding and an action



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire. In 2007, a
    pre-tax charge of $40 million was recorded to cover all of
    the known MTBE cases against the Corporation.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries
    covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on
    the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of
    the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has
    previously installed more advanced pollution controls. In
    January 2011, HOVENSA signed a Consent Decree with EPA to
    resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree,
    HOVENSA will pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and
    spend approximately $700 million over the next
    10 years to install equipment and implement additional
    operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce
    emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to
    spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental
    project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands
    and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power
    Authority with monitoring. The Consent Decree has been lodged
    with the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands and
    approval is pending. In addition, substantial progress has been
    made towards resolving this matter for the Port Reading refining
    facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse
    impact on the Corporation’s financial position or results
    of operations.

The United States Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (the
    Act) implemented a royalty relief program that relieves eligible
    leases issued between November 28, 1995 and
    November 28, 2000 from paying royalties on deepwater
    production in Federal Outer Continental Shelf lands. The Act
    does not impose any price thresholds in order to qualify for the
    royalty relief. The U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS,
    predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation
    and Enforcement) created regulations that included pricing
    requirements to qualify for the royalty relief provided in the
    Act. During the period from 2003 to 2009, the Corporation
    accrued the royalties imposed by the MMS regulations. The
    legality of the thresholds imposed by the MMS was challenged in
    the federal courts and, in October 2009, the U.S. Supreme
    Court decided not to review the appellate court’s decision
    against the MMS. As a result, the Corporation recognized a
    pre-tax gain of $143 million ($89 million after income
    taxes) in 2009 to reverse all previously recorded royalties. The
    pre-tax gain is reported in Other, net within the Statement of
    Consolidated Income.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
    and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
    to other environmental matters. The Corporation cannot predict
    with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved
    or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for
    proceedings that are in their early stages of development or
    where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may
    need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy
    discovery and determination of important factual matters before
    a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any
    proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s
    opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the
    outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse
    effect on the financial condition of the Corporation, although
    the outcome of such proceedings could be material to the
    Corporation’s results of operations and cash flows for a
    particular period depending on, among other things, the level of
    the Corporation’s net income for such period.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves are
    calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and the
    requirements of the FASB. Proved oil and gas reserves are
    quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering
    data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be
    economically producible from known reservoirs under existing
    economic conditions, operating methods and government
    regulations. The Corporation’s estimation of net
    recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is
    a highly technical process performed by internal teams of
    geoscience professionals and reservoir engineers. Estimates of
    reserves were prepared by the use of standard engineering and
    geoscience methods generally recognized in the petroleum
    industry. The method or combination of methods used in the
    analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the
    reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at
    the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and
    the production history. Where applicable, reliable technologies
    may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC
    regulations. These technologies, including computational
    methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide
    reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in
    the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In
    order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required
    government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost
    of the project, either senior management or the board of
    directors must commit to fund the development. The
    Corporation’s proved reserves are subject to certain risks
    and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A, Risk
    Factors Related to Our Business and Operations on page 14
    of this

Form 10-K.

Internal
    Controls

The Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas
    reserve estimation process which are administered by the
    Corporation’s Senior Vice President of E&P Technology
    and its Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are
    prepared by technical staff that work directly with the oil and
    gas properties using standard reserve estimation guidelines,
    definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates for
    a selection of the Corporation’s assets are subject to
    internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an
    independent third party reserve engineer reviews and audits a
    significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves
    (see below). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management
    and the Board of Directors.

Qualifications

The person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation
    of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves is Mr. Scott
    Heck, Senior Vice President of E&P Technology.
    Mr. Heck is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers
    and has over 30 years of experience in the oil and gas
    industry with a BS degree in Petroleum Engineering. His
    experience includes over 15 years primarily focused on oil
    and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both
    domestic and international areas. The Corporation’s
    upstream technology organization, which Mr. Heck manages,
    focuses on oil and gas industry subsurface and reservoir
    engineering technologies and evaluation techniques.
    Mr. Heck is also responsible for the Corporation’s
    Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization
    responsible for establishing the policies and processes used
    within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform
    internal technical reserve audits and reviews.

Reserves
    Audit

The Corporation engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and
    MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally
    prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 76% of
    2010 year-end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of
    oil equivalent basis (80% in 2009). The purpose of this audit
    was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of
    internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC
    regulations. The D&M letter report, dated February 2,
    2011, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves
    was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods
    generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an
    independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been
    providing petroleum consulting services



throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s
    letter report on the Corporation’s December 31, 2010
    oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this

Form 10-K.

While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the
    report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M,
    the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and
    audited by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by approximately
    1% of total net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent
    basis. The report also includes among other information, the
    qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for
    overseeing the reserve audit.

Adoption
    of new SEC requirements in 2009

The SEC issued a final rule on oil and gas reserve estimation
    and disclosure effective for year-end 2009 reporting. The
    SEC’s final rule was designed to modernize and update the
    oil and gas reserve disclosure requirements to align them with
    current industry practices and changes in technology. In January
    2010, the FASB issued its final Accounting Standards Update,
    Extractive Industries — Oil and Gas (ASC 932), which
    principally conformed existing FASB standards to the new SEC
    guidelines. Effective with these changes, the product prices
    used in the estimation of oil and gas reserves were the average
    oil and gas selling prices during the twelve month period prior
    to the reporting date determined as an unweighted arithmetic
    average of the

first-day-of-the-month

price for each month within such period, except for prices set
    in contractual arrangements. In 2008, reserves were estimated
    using year-end oil and gas prices.

Since it was not practical to calculate reserve estimates under
    both the old and new reserve estimation standards as of year-end
    2009, it was not possible to precisely measure the effect of
    adopting the new SEC requirements on total proved reserves.
    However, the Corporation estimates that the effect of initially
    applying the new rules, primarily due to application of the new
    reserve definitions and the consideration of permitted
    technology, was to increase year-end 2009 total proved reserves
    by approximately 2%. The change in reserve estimates resulting
    from applying the new rules is included in the table below as
    2009 revisions and additions to proved reserves.

Natural gas reserves in Africa
    were 63 million mcf in 2010, 71 million mcf in 2009
    and 69 million mcf in 2008.

Proved
    undeveloped reserves

The December 31, 2010 oil and gas reserve estimates
    disclosed above include 477 million barrels of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 1,283 million mcf of natural gas, or an
    aggregate of 691 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe),
    classified as proved undeveloped reserves. Overall volumes of
    proved undeveloped reserves increased by 104 mmboe compared with
    year-end 2009. Proved undeveloped reserves increased by 119
    mmboe in 2010 from acquisitions in Norway and the Bakken oil
    shale play in North Dakota. Approximately 30 mmboe of proved
    undeveloped reserves in Indonesia, Gabon and the United Kingdom
    were disposed of in asset sales and exchanges. Additions and
    revisions in proved undeveloped reserves from existing fields
    amounted to 73 mmboe, primarily in the United States, Denmark,
    Libya and JDA. These increases resulted from ongoing technical
    assessments, performance evaluations and development planning.
    In 2010, 58 mmboe were converted from proved undeveloped
    reserves to developed resulting from continuing development
    activity and new wells in Libya, Russia, the Bakken in North
    Dakota, the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico, the Pailin Field
    in Thailand and the JDA. The Corporation estimates that capital
    expenditures of approximately $600 million were incurred to
    convert proved undeveloped reserves to developed during 2010.

The Corporation is involved in multiple long-term projects that
    have staged developments. Certain of these projects have proved
    reserves, which have been classified as undeveloped for a period
    in excess of five years, totaling 175 mmboe or 11% of total 2010
    proved reserves. Substantially all of the proved undeveloped
    reserves in excess of five years old relate to five offshore
    producing assets. Four natural gas projects in the JDA,
    Indonesia and Norway are being developed in phases to satisfy
    long-term natural gas sales contracts and an oil project in
    Azerbaijan is continuing to be developed in phases. A summary of
    the development status of each of the five projects follows:

•

JDA — This natural gas project in the Gulf of Thailand
    currently has a central processing platform and six wellhead
    platforms. A seventh wellhead platform is under construction and
    the operator plans to begin construction of two additional
    wellhead platforms in 2011.

•

Pangkah — This natural gas and oil project offshore
    Java, Indonesia currently has one producing offshore wellhead
    platform and onshore production facilities. A second wellhead
    platform has been installed and is currently supporting drilling
    operations. In addition, a central processing platform is
    currently under construction and is expected to be installed in
    2011 to expand oil and water handling capacity.

•

Natuna A — This natural gas project offshore Sumatra,
    Indonesia currently has one wellhead platform, a central
    processing facility and a floating, storage and offloading
    vessel. The operator is constructing a second wellhead platform
    and a separate central processing platform which is expected to
    be in service in 2011. Additional wellhead platforms and subsea
    well tie-backs are in the field development plan.



•

Snohvit — This liquefied natural gas project offshore
    Norway currently has processing and liquefaction facilities on
    Melkoya Island with subsea wells tied-back to the facilities.
    Future development will continue based on available production
    capacity to meet contracted gas sales volumes.

•

ACG — This oil project offshore Azerbaijan in the
    Caspian Sea has seven operational platforms that have been
    completed over multiple phases of development. The operator
    began construction on another production platform in 2010.

Production
    sharing contracts

The Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and
    natural gas reserves relating to long-term supply agreements
    with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the
    legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the
    production. Proved reserves from these production sharing
    contracts for each of the three years ended December 31,
    2010 are presented separately below, as well as volumes produced
    and received during 2010, 2009 and 2008 from these production

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil
    and gas selling prices used in determining year-end reserve
    estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual
    arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and
    gas reserves, less estimated future development and production
    costs, which are based on year-end costs and existing economic
    assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying
    the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates to the pre-tax net
    cash flows relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas
    reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed
    rate of 10%. The discounted future net cash flow estimates do
    not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate
    general and administrative expenses. The selling prices of crude
    oil and natural gas are highly volatile. The prices which are
    required to be used for the discounted future net cash flows do
    not include the effects of hedges and may not be representative
    of future selling prices. The future net cash flow estimates
    could be materially different if other assumptions were used.
