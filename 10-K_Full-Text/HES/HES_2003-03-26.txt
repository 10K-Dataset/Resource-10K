PART I

Item 1.

Business

Amerada Hess Corporation (the
“Registrant”) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated
in 1920. The Registrant and its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as the “Corporation”) explore for,
produce, purchase, transport and sell crude oil and natural gas.
These exploration and production activities take place in the
United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Algeria,
Malaysia, Colombia and other countries. The Corporation also
manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined
petroleum and other energy products. The Corporation owns 50% of
a refinery joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands,
and another refining facility, terminals and retail gasoline
stations located on the East Coast of the United States.

Exploration and Production

At December 31, 2002, the Corporation had
782 million barrels of proved crude oil and natural gas
liquids reserves compared with 955 million barrels at the
end of 2001. Proved natural gas reserves were 2,477 million
Mcf at December 31, 2002 compared with 2,881 million
Mcf at December 31, 2001. These crude oil and natural gas
reserves include the Corporation’s proportionate share of
the reserves of equity investees. Proved reserves at
December 31, 2002 include 27% and 33%, respectively, of
crude oil and natural gas held under production sharing
contracts. Of the total proved reserves (on a barrel of oil
equivalent basis), 19% are located in the United States, 42% are
located in the United Kingdom, Norwegian and Danish sectors of
the North Sea and the remainder are located in Algeria,
Azerbaijan, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand,
Malaysia and Colombia. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, 33%
of the Corporation’s December 31, 2002 worldwide
proved reserves are undeveloped (35% in 2001). Subsequent to
year-end, the Corporation exchanged its producing properties in
Colombia for an additional 25% interest in a block with proved
reserves in the Joint Development Area between Malaysia and
Thailand (“JDA”). The Corporation has also agreed to
exchange its 25% interest in Premier Oil plc, an oil and gas
exploration and production company, for an interest in a
producing gas field in Indonesia.

Worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids
production amounted to 325,000 barrels per day in 2002
compared with 298,000 barrels per day in 2001. Worldwide natural
gas production was 754,000 Mcf per day in 2002 compared with
812,000 Mcf per day in 2001. The Corporation presently estimates
that its 2003 barrel of oil equivalent production will be
approximately 20% less than its 2002 production. The Corporation
is developing a number of oil and gas fields and also has an
inventory of domestic and foreign drillable prospects.

United
States

.  Amerada Hess
Corporation operates mainly offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and
onshore in Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota. During 2002, 20%
of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids
production and 49% of its natural gas production were from
United States operations.

The table below sets forth the Corporation’s
average daily net production by area in the United States:



*

Reflects natural gas production converted on the
    basis of relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).

The Llano Field (AHC 27.50%) on Garden Banks
Blocks 385 and 386 in the Gulf of Mexico is currently being
developed with initial production expected in 2004. Appraisal
drilling is planned for the Shenzi prospect (AHC 28%) on Green
Canyon Block 654 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

At December 31, 2002, the Corporation has an
interest in 318 exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico of
which it operates 206. The Corporation has 668,000 net
undeveloped acres in the Gulf of Mexico.

United
Kingdom.

The
Corporation’s activities in the United Kingdom are
conducted by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Amerada Hess Limited.
During 2002, 36% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
gas liquids production and 37% of its natural gas production
were from United Kingdom operations.

The table below sets forth the Corporation’s
average daily net production in the United Kingdom by field and
the Corporation’s interest in each at December 31,
2002:



During 2002, the Halley Field (AHC 40%) was
brought onstream. Development of the Clair Field (AHC 9.29%) is
proceeding and it is expected to begin production in 2004. The
Atlantic (AHC 25%) and Cromarty (AHC 90%) fields are awaiting
approval for development.

Amerada Hess Limited has entered into an
agreement with Premier Oil plc, a United Kingdom company with
international exploration and production interests, to exchange
its 25% shareholding interest in Premier for a 23% interest in
Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia.

Norway.

The
Corporation’s activities in Norway are conducted through
its wholly-owned Norwegian subsidiary, Amerada Hess Norge A/S.
Norwegian operations accounted for crude oil and natural gas
liquids production of 25,000 and 26,000 barrels per day
respectively, in 2002 and 2001. Natural gas production averaged
25,000 Mcf per day in both 2002 and 2001. Substantially all of
the Norwegian production is from the Corporation’s 28.09%
interest in the Valhall Field. An enhanced-recovery waterflood
project for the Valhall Field has been approved and initial
water injection is scheduled for late 2003.

Denmark.

Amerada
Hess ApS, the Corporation’s Danish subsidiary, operates the
South Arne Field. Net crude oil production from the
Corporation’s 57.48% interest in the South Arne Field was
23,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2002 compared to 20,000
barrels of oil per day in 2001. Natural gas production was
37,000 Mcf and 43,000 Mcf of natural gas per day in 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Equatorial
Guinea.

The Corporation has
interests in production sharing contracts covering three
offshore blocks, acquired in August 2001. Net crude oil
production from the Corporation’s 85% interest in the Ceiba
Field averaged 37,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2002
and 6,000 barrels per day in 2001 at an annualized rate.
Development plans for the Okume, Oveng and Elon fields (AHC 85%)
in the Rio Muni Basin offshore Equatorial Guinea were submitted
for approval to the Government of Equatorial Guinea late in
2002. Exploration discoveries in 2002 included the Ebano, Elon,
Akom and Abang fields (AHC 85%). Additional appraisal drilling
is planned for these discoveries and development plans are being
considered. An appraisal well was drilled in early 2003 that
confirmed an earlier discovery well in 2002 and further
appraisal drilling is planned.

Gabon.

Amerada
Hess Production Gabon, the Corporation’s 77.5% owned
Gabonese subsidiary, has a 10% interest in the Rabi Kounga Field
and a 40% interest in the Atora Field. The Corporation’s
share of production averaged 9,000 net barrels of crude oil per
day in 2002 and 2001.

Indonesia.

The
Corporation has a 30% interest in the Jabung production sharing
contract, which includes the North Geragai and Makmur fields.
Net production from these fields averaged 4,000 barrels of oil
per day in 2002 and 6,000 barrels of oil per day in 2001. The
Jabung production sharing contract area is currently being
considered for sale. The Corporation has agreed to acquire a 23%
interest in the Natuna Sea Block A production sharing
contract from Premier Oil plc in exchange for its 25%
shareholding in Premier. A natural gas discovery in the Pangkah
production sharing contract area is currently being developed
and other discoveries in Indonesia are being evaluated.

Thailand.

The
Corporation has a 15% interest in the Pailin gas field offshore
Thailand. Net production from the Corporation’s interest
averaged 35,000 Mcf and 20,000 Mcf of natural gas per day in
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Algeria.

The
Corporation has a 49% interest in a venture with the Algerian
national oil company, which is redeveloping three Algerian oil
fields. The Corporation’s share of production averaged
15,000 and 13,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Azerbaijan.

The
Corporation has a 2.72% interest in the AIOC Consortium in the
Caspian Sea. Net production from its interest averaged 4,000
barrels of oil per day in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Malaysia — Thailand.

At
year-end 2002, the Corporation owned a 25% interest in a
production sharing contract in Block A-18 of the Joint
Development Area (“JDA”) of Malaysia and Thailand
through its 50% interest in an equity investee.



In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation
acquired an additional 25% interest in the Block A-18 reserves
in the JDA. The production sharing contract has a gas sales
agreement for the sale of the first phase of gas production.
Commencement of production is subject to completion of pipeline
facilities to be constructed by the gas purchaser.

Colombia.

The
Corporation’s share of production averaged
22,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2002 and
10,000 barrels per day in 2001 at an annualized rate. In
February 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing
properties in Colombia, plus $10 million in cash, for an
additional 25% interest in Block A-18 of the JDA.

Refining and Marketing

Refining.

The
Corporation owns a 50% interest in the HOVENSA refining joint
venture in the United States Virgin Islands. In addition, it
owns and operates a refining facility in Port Reading, New
Jersey.

HOVENSA.

The
refinery is a joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In 2002, the Corporation’s
share of refinery crude runs averaged 181,000 barrels per
day compared with 202,000 barrels per day in 2001. During
2002, the 58,000 barrel per day coking unit at the refinery
became operational. The coker permits HOVENSA to run lower-cost
heavy crude oil. PDVSA supplies 155,000 barrels per day of
Venezuelan Mesa crude oil to HOVENSA under a long-term crude oil
supply contract. HOVENSA has a second long-term supply contract
with PDVSA to purchase 115,000 barrels per day of
Venezuelan Merey heavy crude oil. The remaining crude oil is
purchased mainly under contracts of one year or less from third
parties and through spot purchases on the open market. After
sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third parties, the
Corporation purchases 50% of HOVENSA’s remaining production
at market prices.

Port Reading
Facility.

The Corporation
owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey. This facility processes vacuum gas oil and
residual fuel oil. It currently operates at a rate of
approximately 55,000 barrels per day and substantially all of
its production is gasoline and heating oil.

Marketing.

The
Corporation markets refined petroleum products on the East Coast
of the United States to the motoring public, wholesale
distributors, industrial and commercial users, other petroleum
companies, governmental agencies and public utilities. It also
markets natural gas to utilities and other industrial,
commercial customers. The Corporation’s energy marketing
activities include the sale of electricity. The Corporation has
a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades
energy commodities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes
trading positions for its own account.

The Corporation has 1,187 HESS® gasoline
stations at December 31, 2002, of which approximately 67%
are company operated. Most of the gasoline stations are
concentrated in densely populated areas, principally in New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts and North
and South Carolina, and 836 have convenience stores. The
Corporation owns approximately 50% of the properties on which
the stations are located.

The Corporation has a wholly-owned subsidiary
which provides distributed electricity generating equipment to
industrial and commercial customers as an alternative to
purchasing electricity from local utilities. The Corporation
also has invested in long-term technology to develop fuel cells
for electricity generation through a venture with other parties.

The Corporation has 22 terminals with an
aggregate storage capacity of 22 million barrels in its
East Coast marketing areas. Refined product sales averaged
383,000 barrels per day in 2002 and 387,000 barrels per day
in 2001. Of total refined products sold in 2002, approximately
46% was obtained from HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation
purchased the balance from others under short-term supply
contracts and by spot purchases from various sources.



Competition and Market Conditions

The petroleum industry is highly competitive. The
Corporation encounters competition from numerous companies in
each of its activities, particularly in acquiring rights to
explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and
marketing of refined products and natural gas. Many competitors
are larger and have substantially greater resources than the
Corporation. The Corporation is also in competition with
producers and marketers of other forms of energy.

The petroleum business involves large-scale
capital expenditures and risk-taking. In the search for new oil
and gas reserves, long lead times are often required from
successful exploration to subsequent production. Operations in
the petroleum industry depend on a depleting natural resource.
The number of areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons
will be discovered in commercial quantities is constantly
diminishing and exploration risks are high. Areas where
hydrocarbons may be found are often in remote locations or
offshore where exploration and development activities are
capital intensive and operating costs are high.

The major foreign oil producing countries,
including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (“OPEC”), exert considerable influence over
the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum
products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy
on rates of production and other matters has a significant
impact on oil markets and the Corporation. The derivatives
markets are also important in influencing the selling prices of
crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The Corporation
cannot predict the extent to which future market conditions may
be affected by foreign oil producing countries, the derivatives
markets or other external influences.

Other Items

The Corporation’s operations may be affected
by federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and
regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax
claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract
rights, and changes in import regulations, as well as other
political developments. The Corporation has been affected by
certain of these events in various countries in which it
operates. The Corporation markets motor fuels through
lessee-dealers and wholesalers in certain states where
legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from
directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar
legislation has been periodically proposed in the U.S. Congress
and in various other states. The Corporation, at this time,
cannot predict the effect of any of the foregoing on its future
operations.

Compliance with various environmental and
pollution control regulations imposed by federal, state and
local governments is not expected to have a materially adverse
effect on the Corporation’s earnings and competitive
position within the industry. The Corporation spent $9 million
in 2002 for environmental remediation, with a comparable amount
anticipated for 2003. Capital expenditures for facilities,
primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental
standards, were $5 million in 2002 and the Corporation
anticipates $15 million in 2003. Regulatory changes already
made or anticipated in the United States will alter the
composition and emissions characteristics of motor fuels. Future
capital expenditures necessary to comply with these regulations
will be substantial. The Environmental Protection Agency has
adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline and
diesel fuel. These rules phase in beginning in 2004. Capital
expenditures necessary to comply with the low-sulfur gasoline
requirements at Port Reading are expected to be approximately
$70 million over the next four years. Capital expenditures
to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements
at HOVENSA are currently expected to be approximately
$450 million over the next four years. HOVENSA expects to
finance these capital expenditures through cash flow and, if
necessary, future borrowings.

The number of persons employed by the Corporation
averaged 11,662 in 2002 and 10,838 in 2001.

Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 2.

Properties

Reference is made to Item 1 and the operating and
financial information relating to the business and properties of
the Corporation which is incorporated in Item 1 by reference.

Additional information relating to the
Corporation’s oil and gas operations follows:

1. Oil and gas reserves

The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas
reserves at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000 are presented under
Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in the accompanying 2002 Annual
Report to Stockholders, which has been incorporated herein by
reference.

During 2002, the Corporation provided oil and gas
reserve estimates for 2001 to the Department of Energy. Such
estimates are compatible with the information furnished to the
SEC on Form 10-K, although not necessarily directly comparable
due to the requirements of the individual requests. There were
no differences in excess of 5%.

The Corporation has no contracts or agreements to
sell fixed quantities of its crude oil production, although
derivative instruments are used to reduce the effects of changes
in selling prices. In the United States, natural gas is sold to
local distribution companies, and commercial, industrial, and
other purchasers, on a spot basis and under contracts for
varying periods. The Corporation’s United States production
is expected to approximate 60% of its 2003 commitments under
these contracts which total approximately 345,000 Mcf per
day. Natural gas sales commitments for 2004 are comparable. The
Corporation attempts to minimize price and supply risks
associated with its United States natural gas supply commitments
by entering into purchase contracts with third parties having
adequate sources of supply, on terms substantially similar to
those under its commitments.

*

Except as to information specifically
    incorporated herein by reference under Items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 7A
    and 8, no other information or data appearing in the 2002 Annual
    Report to Stockholders is deemed to be filed with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K, or otherwise subject to the SEC’s
    regulations or the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



2. Average selling prices and average
production costs

Note A: Includes inter-company transfers

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

Two actions, which have been consolidated in
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,
have been commenced against certain executive officers and
former executive officers of the Registrant alleging that these
individuals sold shares of the Registrant’s common stock in
advance of the Registrant’s acquisition of Triton Energy
Limited (“Triton”) in 2001 in violation of federal
securities laws. In addition to the federal actions, four
derivative actions seeking damages on behalf of the Registrant,
all of which have been consolidated as a derivative action in
the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, have been
commenced against certain executive officers and former
executive officers of the Registrant, some of whom are also
directors, alleging, among other things, that the officers
breached their fiduciary duties by misusing material non-public
information of the Registrant to personally profit from sales of
the Registrant’s common stock. The Registrant believes that
these actions are without merit and is advancing expenses to
these individuals in accordance with the By-Laws of the
Registrant to defend these actions. The Registrant believes that
these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the
Registrant.

In July through October 1998, eight lawsuits were
filed against Registrant’s subsidiary, Triton and
Thomas G. Finck and Peter Rugg, in their capacities as
former officers of Triton. The lawsuits were filed in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
Texarkana Division, and have been consolidated and are styled

In re: Triton Energy Limited Securities Litigation.

The
consolidated complaint alleged violations of Sections 10(b)
and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, in connection with
disclosures concerning its properties, operations, and value
relating to a prospective sale in 1998 of Triton or of all or a
part of its assets. The lawsuits sought recovery of an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages, fees and costs.

On July 29, 2002, Triton, together with
Messrs. Finck and Rugg entered into a Stipulation and Agreement
of Settlement with the lead plaintiffs and class members
(respectively, the “Lead Plaintiffs” and “Class
Members”) involved in

In Re Triton Energy Limited
Securities Litigation

pursuant to which Triton agreed to pay
a total of $42,000,000 to $49,500,000, depending on proofs of
claims submitted by Class Members, to settle all claims asserted
by the Lead Plaintiffs and the Class Members against the
Defendants. Of this amount, $20,000,000 is covered by
Registrant’s insurance. On September 23, 2002 the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
Texarkana Division, entered an Order and Final Judgment
approving the settlement. As of the date hereof, Triton and its
insurers have paid a total of $42,000,000.

Registrant has been served with a complaint from
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(“DEC”) relating to alleged violations at its
petroleum terminal in Brooklyn, New York. The complaint, which
seeks an order to shut down the terminal and penalties in
unspecified amounts, alleges violations involving the structural
integrity of certain tanks, the erosion of shorelines and
bulkheads, petroleum discharges and improper certification of
tank repairs. DEC is also seeking relief relating to remediation
of certain gasoline stations in the New York metropolitan
area. Registrant believes that many of the allegations are
factually inaccurate or based on an incorrect interpretation of
applicable law. Registrant has already undertaken efforts to
address certain conditions discussed in the complaint.
Registrant intends to vigorously contest the complaint, but is
involved in settlement discussions with DEC.

Over the last five years, many refiners have
entered into consent agreements to resolve EPA’s assertions
that these facilities were modified or expanded without
complying with New Source Review regulations that require
permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and
other regulations which impose emissions control requirements.
These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement
initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have
typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and
required significant capital expenditures to install emissions
control equipment. EPA’s enforcement initiative



is expected to continue in the refining sector.
However, no enforcement action has been threatened or instituted
against the Corporation or HOVENSA.

The Corporation periodically receives notices
from EPA that the Corporation is a “potentially responsible
party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to
various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all
potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally
liable. For certain sites, EPA’s claims or assertions of
liability against the Corporation relating to these sites have
not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites,
EPA’s claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is
under consideration, in all cases for amounts which are not
material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any
related proceedings by private parties, on the business or
accounts of the Corporation cannot be predicted at this time due
to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and
the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not
expected to be material.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in
other judicial and administrative proceedings, including
proceedings relating to other environmental matters. Although
the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained
at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the
Corporation, no such proceeding is required to be disclosed
under applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In management’s opinion, based upon currently
known facts and circumstances, such proceedings in the aggregate
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of the Corporation.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a
Vote of Security Holders

During the fourth quarter of 2002, no matter was
submitted to a vote of security holders through the solicitation
of proxies or otherwise.

Executive Officers of the
Registrant

The following table presents information as of
February 1, 2003 regarding executive officers of the
Registrant:



*

All officers referred to herein hold office in
    accordance with the By-Laws until the first meeting of the
    Directors following the annual meeting of stockholders of the
    Registrant and until their successors shall have been duly
    chosen and qualified. Each of said officers was elected to the
    office set forth opposite his name on May 1, 2002. The
    first meeting of Directors following the next annual meeting of
    stockholders of the Registrant is scheduled to be held
    May 7, 2003.

Except for Messrs. O’Connor, Maxted, Paver,
Rielly and Strode, each of the above officers has been employed
by the Registrant or its subsidiaries in various managerial and
executive capacities for more than five years.
Mr. O’Connor had served in senior executive positions

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Executive Committee and Members

HOVENSA L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of
HOVENSA L.L.C. (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the related statements of operations and
cumulative earnings, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss)
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of HOVENSA L.L.C. at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Thousands of Dollars)

Note 1:     Basis
of Financial Statements and Significant Accounting
Policies

Nature of
Business:

HOVENSA L.L.C. (Company)
was formed as a joint venture between Petroleos de Venezuela,
SA. (PDVSA) and Amerada Hess Corporation (AHC) to
operate the Company’s refinery. The Company purchases crude
oil from PDVSA, AHC and third parties. It manufactures and sells
petroleum products primarily to PDVSA and AHC. In preparing
financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in
the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of
income. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates made by management include: inventory and other asset
valuations, environmental obligations, depreciable lives and
turnaround accruals.

The Company is jointly owned by PDVSA V.I., Inc.
(PDVSA V.I.), a subsidiary of PDVSA, and Hess Oil Virgin Islands
Corp. (HOVIC), a subsidiary of AHC.

A summary of all material transactions between
the Company, its members and affiliates follows:

The Company has a product sales agreement with
AHC and Petroleum Marketing International (Petromar), a
subsidiary of PDVSA. After any sales of refined products by
HOVENSA to third parties, Petromar and AHC each must purchase
50% of HOVENSA’s gasoline, distillate, residual fuel and
other products at market prices. The Company also has long-term
crude oil supply agreements with Petromar, by which Petromar
agrees to sell to HOVENSA a monthly average of 155,000 barrels
per day of Mesa crude oil and 115,000 barrels per day of Merey
crude oil. Because of civil unrest in Venezuela, PDVSA invoked
force majeure under its crude oil supply agreements in December
2002 and curtailed delivery of crude oil. Consequently, the
Company reduced its crude oil charge rate and began purchasing
crude oil from other sources. In March 2003, the force majeure
was lifted and crude oil supplies from PDVSA have returned to
normal.

HOVENSA L.L.C.

NOTES TO THE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Thousands of
Dollars) — (Continued)

PDVSA and AHC each guarantee the payment of up to
50% of the value of the crude oil purchases from third parties.
In addition, PDVSA and AHC have agreed to provide funding (50%
each) to the extent that the Company does not have funds to meet
its senior debt obligations due prior to completion of coker
construction, as defined to include specified post-construction
performance tests. After completion of the coker construction
project, this amount decreases to $ 40,000 each, until
completion of construction required to meet final low sulfur
fuel regulations, after which the amount becomes $ 15,000 each.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents:

Cash equivalents
consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily
convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or
less when acquired.

Restricted
Cash:

Restricted cash at
December 31 was as follows:

Restricted Cash at December 31, 2001 related
to funds associated with tax exempt financing. Use of these
funds was limited to the construction of the Company’s
delayed coking unit and related facilities only. These funds
were used in 2002. In November 2002, the Company established a
Debt Service Reserve Fund under the terms of its loan
agreements. This fund represents 75% of the total estimated debt
service for the next 12 month period.

Inventories:

Inventories of crude oil and refined products are valued at the
lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. During
2002, a reduction of inventory quantities resulted in a
liquidation of LIFO inventories carried at below market costs,
which increased net income by approximately $ 30,900. At
December 31, 2002, LIFO inventory cost was $178,803 lower
than it would have been using the average cost method.

Inventories of materials and supplies are valued
at the lower of cost or market.

Revenue
Recognition:

The Company
recognizes revenues from the sale of petroleum products when
title passes to the customer.

HOVENSA L.L.C.

NOTES TO THE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Thousands of
Dollars) — (Continued)

Depreciation:

Depreciation of refinery facilities is determined principally on
the units-of-production method based on estimated production
volumes. Depreciation of all other equipment is determined on
the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.

Maintenance and
Repairs:

The estimated cost of
major maintenance (turnarounds) is accrued. Other
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against
income as incurred. Renewals and improvements are treated as
additions to property, plant and equipment, and items replaced
are treated as retirements.

Environmental
Policy:

The Company capitalizes
environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
contamination. The Company accrues for environmental expenses
resulting from existing conditions that relate to past
operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably
estimable.

Income Taxes:

The Company is a limited liability company and, as a result,
income taxes are the responsibility of the members.

Interest
Hedges:

In 2001, under the terms
of its bank credit agreement, the Company was required to use
interest rate collars to reduce the effects of fluctuations in
interest expense related to long-term debt. These derivatives
were designated as hedges of future cash flow (cash flow hedges)
and the gains or losses were recorded in other comprehensive
income until the related transactions were expensed in 2002. The
company’s obligation to maintain these hedges was completed
in 2002.

as of December 31 were as follows:

Insurance
Proceeds:

The Company recognized insurance proceeds in 2002
related to the settlement of two business interruption claims:

The cash related to the FCC settlement was
received in the 1st quarter of 2003.

Note 5: Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31 was as follows:

The Company has a $ 546,000 credit agreement with
banks. This agreement consists of a $ 396,000 term loan facility
to finance the construction of a 58,000 barrel per day delayed
coking unit and related facilities and to refinance outstanding
amounts under a previous credit agreement. The term debt is
scheduled to be repaid in semi-annual installments beginning
December 2003 and will be fully amortized by June 2008. The
agreement also includes a $ 150,000 general purposes revolving
credit facility, due to be repaid by 2007. Borrowings under this
agreement bear interest at a margin of 3.00% above the London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At completion of the Coker
Project, this margin will increase by 0.25%. Although
operational, completion of the Coker Project, as defined in the
loan agreements, including post-construction performance
testing, has not yet been achieved. Commitment fees of .375% per
annum are payable on the unused portion of the facilities. The
agreement is collateralized by the physical assets and certain
material contracts of the Company.

HOVENSA L.L.C.

NOTES TO THE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Thousands of
Dollars) — (Continued)

In November 2002, the Company issued $ 126,753 of
Senior Secured Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds under the authority of
the Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Virgin Islands
Public Finance Authority. The Bonds begin to amortize in 2014
and will be fully amortized by July 1, 2021.

The debt agreements contain various restrictions
and conditions with respect to incurrence of additional debt as
well as cash distributions, with cash distributions prohibited
until the completion of the Coker Project and restricted by
means of cash flow coverage ratio covenants until completion of
construction required to meet final low sulfur fuel regulations.

In accordance with the debt agreements, long-term
debt is scheduled to be repaid as follows:

The general purpose revolving credit facility
reduces by $ 50,000 at December 31 in each of the years
2005, 2006 and 2007.

In 2002, the Company capitalized interest of
$18,901 on the delayed coker unit ($21,232 in 2001). The
interest paid (net of amounts capitalized) was $8,619 in 2002,
$0 in 2001 and $3,232 in 2000.

Note 7:     Interest
Hedges

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted FAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This statement required that the Company recognize
all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and
established criteria for using derivatives as hedges.

The Company used interest rate collars to reduce
the effects of fluctuations in interest expense related to
long-term debt.

The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment
from adopting FAS No. 133 resulted from these hedges and
was a cumulative decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income of $2,910. The accounting change also affected current
liabilities. The adoption of FAS No. 133 did not affect net
income or cumulative earnings.

The interest rate collars and the hedged
transactions matured in 2002. These interest rate collars were
designated as hedges of expected future cash flows (cash flow
hedges), and the losses were recorded in other comprehensive
income until the hedged interest was recognized. At
December 31, 2001, deferred losses from interest hedging
were $6,955.

The Company reclassified hedging gains and losses
on interest rate collars from accumulated other comprehensive
income to interest expense (portions of which were capitalized)
over the period hedged. Hedging increased interest expense in
2001 by $3,415 (including $1,360 associated with the transition
adjustment at the beginning of the year) and $6,955 in 2002. The
ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings.
The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not material during the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Note
8:     Environmental
Requirements

In December 1999, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) adopted rules that phase in
limitation on the sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2004.
In December 2000, the EPA adopted regulations to reduce
substantially the allowable sulfur content of diesel fuel by
2006. The EPA and individual states are also considering
restriction or a prohibition on the use of MTBE, a gasoline
additive that the Company produces and uses to meet United
States regulations requiring oxygenation of reformulated
gasoline.

The Company is reviewing options to determine the
most cost effective compliance strategies for these new fuel
regulations. The costs to comply will depend on a variety of
factors, including the availability of suitable technology and
contractors and whether the minimum oxygen content requirement
for reformulated gasoline remains in place if MTBE is banned.
Capital Expenditures necessary to comply with the low sulfur
gasoline and diesel fuel requirements are estimated to be
$450,000 over the next four years.
