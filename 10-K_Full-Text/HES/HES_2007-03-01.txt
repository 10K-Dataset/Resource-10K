Business and Properties

Hess Corporation (formerly Amerada Hess Corporation) (the
    Registrant) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1920. On
    May 3, 2006, Amerada Hess Corporation changed its name to
    Hess Corporation. The Registrant and its subsidiaries
    (collectively referred to as the “Corporation” or
    “Hess”) is a global integrated energy company that
    operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P)
    and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment
    explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and
    sells crude oil and natural gas. These exploration and
    production activities take place in the United States, United
    Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Malaysia,
    Thailand, Russia, Gabon, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Libya, Egypt,
    and other countries. The M&R segment manufactures,
    purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum
    products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation owns 50%
    of a refinery joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands,
    and another refining facility, terminals and retail gasoline
    stations, most of which include convenience stores, located on
    the East Coast of the United States.

    Europe (consisting of reserves in the North Sea and Russia), 25%
    are located in Africa and the remainder are located in
    Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Azerbaijan. On a barrel of
    oil equivalent basis, 40% of the Corporation’s
    December 31, 2006 worldwide proved reserves are undeveloped
    (42% in 2005). Proved reserves at December 31, 2006 include
    26% and 56%, respectively, of crude oil and natural gas reserves
    held under production sharing contracts.

Worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids production amounted
    to 257,000 barrels per day in 2006 compared with
    244,000 barrels per day in 2005. Worldwide natural gas
    production was 612,000 mcf per day in 2006 compared with 544,000
    mcf per day in 2005. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis,
    production was 359,000 barrels per day in 2006 compared

The Corporation presently estimates that its 2007 barrel of
    oil equivalent production will be approximately 370,000 to
    380,000 barrels per day. The Corporation is developing a
    number of oil and gas fields and has an inventory of domestic
    and foreign exploration prospects.



United
    States

During 2006, 18% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
    gas liquids production and 18% of its natural gas production
    were from United States operations. The Corporation operates
    mainly offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Texas and
    North Dakota. During 2006, the Corporation completed the sale of
    its interests in certain producing properties in the Permian
    Basin in Texas and New Mexico and certain U.S. Gulf Coast
    oil and gas producing assets. Total net production from assets
    sold was approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
    day at the time of sale.

In the second quarter of 2006, the Shenzi development (Hess 28%)
    in the Green Canyon Block area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico
    was sanctioned by the operator and first oil is expected in the
    second half of 2009. Plans for the Shenzi development in 2007
    include the drilling of development wells and continued
    construction of platform components and subsea equipment
    installation. In February 2007, the Corporation acquired a 28%
    interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and
    608 for $371 million. The Genghis Khan development is part
    of the same geologic structure as the Shenzi development and
    first production from this development is expected in the second
    half of 2007.

In 2006, an exploration well on the Corporation’s Pony
    prospect (Hess 100%) on Green Canyon Block 468 in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico encountered 475 feet of oil
    saturated sandstone in Miocene age reservoirs. Drilling of an
    appraisal sidetrack well on the Pony Prospect was completed in
    January 2007 which encountered 280 feet of oil saturated
    sandstone in Miocene age reservoirs after penetrating sixty
    percent of its geological objective. Drilling of the sidetrack
    well was stopped for mechanical reasons after successfully
    recovering 450 feet of conventional core. The Corporation
    is currently drilling an appraisal well about 7,400 feet
    northwest of the discovery well.

In 2006, on the Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%) in the
    Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a
    successful appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons approximately
    5 miles from the initial discovery well. The operator
    intends to drill two sidetrack wells in 2007 which will further
    delineate the field.

The Corporation has an interest in the Seminole-San Andres Unit
    (Hess 34.3%) in the Permian Basin. A residual oil zone
    development at the Seminole-San Andres Unit is expected to
    commence in 2007 and it is anticipated that production from this
    development will begin in 2009. The Corporation intends to use
    carbon dioxide gas from its interests in the West Bravo Dome and
    Bravo Dome fields in New Mexico for the enhanced recovery effort
    in this residual oil zone development.

At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has interests in over
    400 exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. The Corporation
    has 1,525,304 net undeveloped acres in the Gulf of Mexico.

Europe

During 2006, 44% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
    gas liquids production and 46% of its natural gas production
    were from European operations.

United Kingdom:

Production of crude oil
    and natural gas liquids from the United Kingdom North Sea was
    54,000 barrels per day in 2006 compared with
    57,000 barrels per day in 2005, principally from the
    Corporation’s non-operated interests in the Beryl (Hess
    22.2%), Bittern (Hess 28.3%), Schiehallion (Hess 15.7%) and
    Clair (Hess 9.3%) fields. Natural gas production from the United
    Kingdom in 2006 was 244,000 mcf of natural gas per day compared
    with 222,000 mcf per day in 2005, primarily from gas fields in
    the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 28.8%), as well as Everest
    (Hess 18.7%), Lomond (Hess 16.7%) and Beryl (Hess 22.2%). In
    addition, production from the Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty
    (Hess 90%) fields commenced in June of 2006 and the fields
    produced at a combined rate of approximately 95,000 mcf per day
    net to Hess in the second half of 2006.

In the first half of 2007, the Corporation expects to complete
    the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields with
    an effective date of January 1, 2007 for approximately
    $100 million. The Corporation’s share of net
    production from these fields was 9,000 barrels of oil
    equivalent per day at the end of 2006.

Norway:

Crude oil and natural gas
    liquids production was 23,000 barrels per day in 2006 and
    27,000 barrels per day in 2005. Natural gas production
    averaged 22,000 mcf per day in 2006 and 28,000 mcf per day in
    2005. Substantially all of the Norwegian production is from the
    Corporation’s interest in the Valhall field (Hess 28.1%).



Denmark:

Net production from the
    Corporation’s interest in the South Arne field (Hess 57.5%)
    was 19,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2006 and 24,000
    barrels of crude oil per day in 2005. Natural gas production was
    17,000 mcf per day in 2006 and 24,000 mcf per day in 2005.

Russia:

The Corporation’s
    activities in Russia are conducted through its 80%-owned
    interest in a corporate joint venture operating in the
    Volga-Urals region of Russia. Production averaged
    18,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2006 compared to
    6,000 barrels per day in 2005. The Corporation’s
    initial interest in its Russian joint venture was acquired
    during 2005.

Africa

During 2006, 33% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
    gas liquids production was from African operations.

Equatorial Guinea:

The Corporation is
    the operator and owns an interest in Block G (Hess 85%) which
    contains the Ceiba field and Okume Complex. Net production from
    the Ceiba field averaged 28,000 barrels of crude oil per
    day in 2006 and 30,000 barrels per day in 2005. Production
    of crude oil from the Okume Complex commenced in December 2006.
    The Corporation estimates that its net share of 2007 production
    from the Okume Complex will average approximately
    20,000 barrels of oil per day. In 2007, the Corporation
    plans to complete the construction of offshore production
    facilities and to drill additional development wells at the
    Okume Complex.

Algeria:

The Corporation has a 49%
    interest in a venture with the Algerian national oil company
    that is redeveloping three oil fields. The Corporation’s
    share of production averaged 22,000 and 25,000 barrels of
    crude oil per day in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    Corporation has also submitted a plan of development for a small
    oil discovery on Block 401C, which is currently awaiting
    government approval.

Libya:

In January 2006, the
    Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners,
    re-entered its former oil and gas production operations in the
    Waha concessions in Libya (Hess 8.16%). The re-entry terms
    included a

25-year

extension of the concessions and payments by the Corporation to
    the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $359 million. The
    Corporation’s net share of 2006 production from Libya
    averaged 23,000 barrels of oil per day. The Corporation
    also owns a 100% interest in offshore exploration Area 54.

Gabon:

Through its 77.5% owned Gabonese
    subsidiary, the Corporation has interests in the Rabi Kounga,
    Toucan and Atora fields. The Corporation’s share of
    production averaged 12,000 barrels of crude oil per day in
    2006 and 2005.

Egypt:

In January 2006, the Corporation
    acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the
    West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the West Med Block)
    in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a

25-year

development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four
    existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
    opportunities.

Asia
    and Other

During 2006, 5% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
    gas liquids production and 36% of its natural gas production
    were from Asian operations.

Joint Development Area of Malaysia and
    Thailand:

The Corporation owns an interest in
    the production sharing agreement covering Block

A-18

of the
    Joint Development Area (JDA) (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand.
    Net production averaged 131,000 mcf of natural gas and
    2,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2006 compared to
    51,000 mcf of natural gas and 1,000 barrels of crude oil
    per day in 2005. In 2007, the Corporation’s capital
    investments in the JDA will be primarily focused on facilities
    expansion and development drilling associated with the
    additional contracted gas sales of 400,000 mcf per day (gross)
    in 2008. It is anticipated that production associated with these
    additional gas sales will begin ramping up in the fourth quarter
    of 2007.

Thailand:

The Corporation has an
    interest in the Pailin gas field (Hess 15%) offshore Thailand.
    Net production from the Corporation’s interest averaged
    60,000 mcf and 57,000 mcf of natural gas per day in 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The Corporation is the operator and owns an
    interest in the onshore natural gas project in the Phu



Horm Block (Hess 35%) which commenced production in November
    2006. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2007 production
    from Phu Horm will average approximately 30,000 mcf of natural
    gas per day.

Indonesia:

The Corporation’s net
    share of natural gas production from Indonesia averaged 26,000
    mcf per day in 2006 and 25,000 mcf per day in 2005 primarily
    from its interest in the Natuna A gas field (Hess 23%). The
    Ujung Pangkah project (Hess 75%), where the Corporation is the
    operator, is expected to commence gas sales by mid 2007 under an
    existing gas sales agreement for 440 million mcf (gross)
    over a 20 year period with an expected plateau rate of
    100,000 mcf per day (gross). The Corporation’s plans for
    Ujung Pangkah in 2007 include drilling additional development
    wells, the completion of onshore and offshore gas facilities and
    the commencement of a crude oil development project. The
    Corporation also owns an interest in the Jambi Merang natural
    gas project (Hess 25%).

Azerbaijan:

The Corporation has an
    interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) fields (Hess 2.72%)
    in the Caspian Sea. Net production from its interest averaged
    7,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2006 and
    4,000 barrels per day in 2005. Phase 2 production from
    the ACG fields commenced during 2006. The Corporation also holds
    an interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline (Hess
    2.36%), which started operation in the second quarter of 2006.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas reserves at the
    end of 2006, 2005 and 2004 are presented under Supplementary Oil
    and Gas Data on pages 80 and 81 in the accompanying
    financial statements.

During 2006, the Corporation provided oil and gas reserve
    estimates for 2005 to the United States Department of Energy.
    Such estimates are compatible with the information furnished to
    the SEC on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2005, although not
    necessarily directly comparable due to the requirements of the
    individual requests. There were no differences in excess of 5%.

The Corporation has no contracts or agreements to sell fixed
    quantities of its crude oil production. In the United States,
    natural gas is sold on a spot basis and under contracts for
    varying periods to local distribution companies, and commercial,
    industrial and other purchasers. The Corporation’s United
    States natural gas production is expected to approximate 20% of
    its 2007 sales commitments under long-term contracts. The
    Corporation attempts to minimize price and supply risks
    associated with its United States natural gas supply commitments
    by entering into purchase contracts with third parties having
    adequate sources of supply, on terms substantially similar to
    those under its commitments and by leasing storage facilities.
    In international markets, the Corporation generally sells its
    natural gas production under long-term sales contracts. In the
    United Kingdom, the Corporation also sells a portion of its
    natural gas production on a spot basis.

The fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for
    approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance in 2006.

The delayed coker unit permits HOVENSA to run lower-cost heavy
    crude oil. HOVENSA has a long-term supply contract with PDVSA to
    purchase 115,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy
    crude oil. PDVSA also supplies 155,000 barrels per day of
    Venezuelan Mesa medium gravity crude oil to HOVENSA under a
    long-term crude oil supply contract. The remaining crude oil
    requirements are purchased mainly under contracts of one year or
    less from third parties and through spot purchases on the open
    market. After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to unrelated
    third parties, the Corporation purchases 50% of HOVENSA’s
    remaining production at market prices.

Port Reading Facility:

The Corporation
    owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey, with a capacity of 65,000 barrels per
    day. This facility processes residual fuel oil and vacuum gas
    oil and operated at a rate of approximately 63,000 barrels
    per day in 2006 and 55,000 barrels per day in 2005.
    Substantially all of Port Reading’s production is gasoline
    and heating oil.

Marketing:

The Corporation markets
    refined petroleum products on the East Coast of the United
    States to the motoring public, wholesale distributors,
    industrial and commercial users, other petroleum companies,
    governmental agencies and public utilities. It also markets
    natural gas and electricity to utilities and other industrial
    and commercial customers. During 2006 and 2005, the Corporation
    selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring
    natural gas and electricity customer accounts.

The Corporation has 1,350
    HESS

®

gasoline stations at December 31, 2006, including stations
    owned by the WilcoHess joint venture (Hess 44%). Approximately
    88% of the gasoline stations are operated by the Company or
    WilcoHess. Of the operated stations, 92% have convenience stores
    on the sites. Most of the Corporation’s gasoline stations
    are in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida,
    Massachusetts, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Refined product sales averaged 459,000 barrels per day in
    2006 and 456,000 barrels per day in 2005. Of total refined
    products sold in 2006, approximately 50% was obtained from
    HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation purchased the balance
    from others under short-term supply contracts and by spot
    purchases from various sources.

The Corporation has 22 terminals with an aggregate storage
    capacity of 22 million barrels in its East Coast marketing
    areas.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
    Corporation also takes energy commodity and derivative trading
    positions for its own account.

The Corporation also has a 50% interest in a joint venture, Hess
    LNG, which is pursuing investments in liquefied natural gas
    (LNG) terminals and related supply, trading and marketing
    opportunities. The joint venture is pursuing the development of
    LNG terminal projects located in Fall River, Massachusetts and
    Shannon, Ireland.

The Corporation has a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides
    distributed electricity generating equipment to industrial and
    commercial customers as an alternative to purchasing electricity
    from local utilities. The Corporation also has invested in
    long-term technology to develop fuel cells for electricity
    generation through a venture with other parties.



Competition
    and Market Conditions

See Item 1A, Risk Factors Related to Our Business and
    Operations, for a discussion of competition and market
    conditions.

Other
    Items

Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution
    control regulations imposed by federal, state, local and foreign
    governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
    the Corporation’s earnings and competitive position within
    the industry. The Corporation spent $15 million in 2006 for
    environmental remediation. The United States Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted rules that limit the amount
    of sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuel. Capital expenditures
    necessary to comply with the low-sulfur gasoline requirements at
    Port Reading were $72 million, of which $23 million
    was spent in 2005 and the remainder was spent in 2006. Capital
    expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel
    requirements at HOVENSA are expected to be approximately
    $420 million, of which $360 million has been spent to
    date and the remainder will be spent in 2007. HOVENSA expects to
    finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from
    operations.

The number of persons employed by the Corporation at year end
    was approximately 13,700 in 2006 and 12,800 in 2005.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors Related to Our Business and Operations

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant risk factors, including those described
    below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect
    our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of
    operations, and as a result holders and purchasers of our
    securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is
    possible additional risks relating to our securities may be
    described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in
    the future.

Commodity Price Risk:

Our estimated proved
    reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins,
    future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on
    the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum
    products, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our
    control. Historically these prices have been very volatile. The
    major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the
    Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert
    considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil
    and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to
    agree on a common policy on rates of production and other
    matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The
    derivatives markets may also influence the selling prices of
    crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. A
    significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a
    material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and cash
    flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of
    our oil and gas assets, goodwill and proved oil and gas
    reserves. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to
    mitigate commodity price volatility, we will not realize the
    benefit of price increases above the hedged price.

Technical Risk:

We own or have access to a
    finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted
    over time. Replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to
    successful exploration drilling, development activities, and
    enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas
    production is dependent on technical success in finding



and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration
    activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other
    geological and geophysical data, which does not always
    successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of
    hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include adverse unexpected
    conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment
    failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments
    may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which
    negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The costs of
    drilling and development activities have also been increasing,
    which could negatively affect expected economic returns.
    Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and
    gas properties, similar uncertainties may be encountered in the
    production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others.

Oil and Gas Reserves and Discounted Future Net Cash Flow
    Risks:

Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating
    quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those
    reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices,
    revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses,
    geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas
    reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the
    estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities
    and future net revenues of our proved reserves. In addition,
    reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions
    based on production performance, purchases or sales of
    properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and
    gas prices, production sharing contracts which may decrease
    reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other
    factors.

Political Risk:

Federal, state, local,
    territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax
    increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property,
    cancellation of contract rights, and changes in import
    regulations, as well as other political developments may affect
    our operations. For example, during 2006, the governments of the
    United Kingdom and Algeria increased taxation on our crude oil
    and natural gas revenues in response to higher crude oil and
    natural gas prices. Some of the international areas in which we
    operate may be politically less stable than our domestic
    operations. In addition, the increasing threat of terrorism
    around the world poses additional risks to the operations of the
    oil and gas industry. In our M&R segment, we market motor
    fuels through lessee-dealers and wholesalers in certain states
    where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil
    from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels.
    Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the
    U.S. Congress and in various other states.

Environmental Risk:

Our oil and gas
    operations, like those of the industry, are subject to
    environmental hazards such as oil spills, produced water spills,
    gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases
    that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or
    other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to
    numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign
    environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these
    laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or
    criminal penalties, remedial

clean-ups

and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition,
    increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly
    relating to the production of motor and other fuels, has
    resulted, and will likely continue to result, in higher capital
    expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas
    industry generally.

Competitive Risk:

The petroleum industry is
    highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter
    competition from numerous companies in each of our activities,
    particularly in acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and
    natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of refined
    products and natural gas. Many competitors, including national
    oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater
    resources. We are also in competition with producers and
    marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for
    worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the
    cost of acquisitions. In addition, competition for drilling
    services and equipment has affected the availability of drilling
    rigs and increased capital and operating costs.

Catastrophic Risk:

Although we maintain an
    appropriate level of insurance coverage against property and
    casualty losses, our oil and gas operations are subject to
    unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or
    interrupt operations. Examples of catastrophic risks include
    hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts. These occurrences
    have affected us from time to time. During 2005, our annual Gulf
    of Mexico production of crude oil and natural gas was reduced by
    7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) due to the
    impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Purported class actions consolidated under a complaint
    captioned:

In re Amerada Hess Securities

Litigation were
    filed in United States District Court for the District of New
    Jersey against the Registrant and certain executive officers and
    former executive officers of the Registrant alleging that these
    individuals sold shares of the Registrant’s common stock in
    advance of the Registrant’s acquisition of Triton Energy
    Limited (Triton) in 2001 in violation of federal securities
    laws. In April 2003, the Registrant and the other defendants
    filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and
    failure to plead fraud with particularity. On March 31,
    2004, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss
    the complaint. The plaintiffs were granted leave to file an
    amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in June
    2004. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In June
    2005, this motion was denied. On January 30, 2007, the
    District Court issued an order preliminarily approving
    settlement of this action and providing for notice to members of
    the class of plaintiffs. While continuing to deny the
    allegations of the complaint and all charges of wrongdoing or
    liability arising in connection with the subject matter of the
    action, the defendants agreed with plaintiffs to settle the
    action on the terms set forth in the stipulation of settlement
    in order to avoid the cost, inconvenience and uncertainty of
    continued protracted litigation. Under the terms of the
    settlement, defendants have caused to be deposited into an
    escrow account the sum of $9 million, which after payment
    of certain administrative expenses and plaintiffs’ attorney
    fees, will be distributed according to a plan of allocation to
    class members who submit valid and timely proof of claim and
    release forms. All of the amount deposited was paid by the
    defendants’ insurer. The settlement is subject to final
    approval of the district court and certain other conditions,
    including that not more than 5% of shares owned by class members
    eligible to participate in the settlement elect to opt out of
    the settlement.

The Registrant, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of substantially identical
    lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental
    entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States
    against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produce
    gasoline containing MTBE, including the Registrant. These cases
    have been consolidated in the Southern District of New York and
    the Registrant is named as a defendant in 43 of the 69 cases
    pending. The principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline
    containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties
    are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline
    market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to
    take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the
    environment of releases of MTBE. In some cases, punitive damages
    are also sought. In April 2005, the District Court denied the
    primary legal aspects of the defendants’ motion to dismiss
    these actions. While the damages claimed in these actions are
    substantial, only limited information is available to evaluate
    the factual and legal merits of those claims. The Corporation
    also believes that significant legal uncertainty remains
    regarding the validity of causes of action asserted and
    availability of the relief sought by plaintiffs. Accordingly,
    based on the information currently available, there is
    insufficient information on which to evaluate the
    Corporation’s exposure in these cases.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the EPA’s assertions that
    refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying
    with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new
    emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations
    that impose emissions control requirements. These consent
    agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative
    focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically
    imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. Settlements under Petroleum Refining Initiative
    consent agreements to date have averaged $335 per barrel
    per day of refining capacity. However the capital expenditures,
    penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual
    refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly,
    depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the
    circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the
    refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution
    controls. EPA initially contacted Registrant and HOVENSA L.L.C.
    (HOVENSA), its 50% owned joint venture with Petroleos de
    Venezuela, regarding the Petroleum Refinery Initiative in August
    2003 and discussions resumed in August 2005. The Registrant and
    HOVENSA have had and expect to have further discussions with the
    EPA regarding the Petroleum Refining Initiative, although both
    the Registrant and HOVENSA have already installed many of the
    pollution controls required of other refiners under the consent
    agreements and the EPA has not made any specific



assertions that either Registrant or HOVENSA violated either New
    Source Review or other regulations which would require
    additional controls. While the effect on the Corporation of the
    Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot be estimated at this time,
    additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses
    may be incurred. The amount of penalties, if any, is not
    expected to be material to the Corporation.

In December 2006, HOVENSA received a Notice of Violation (NOV)
    from the EPA alleging non-compliance with emissions limits in a
    permit issued by the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and
    Natural Resources (DPNR) for the two process heaters in the
    delayed coking unit. The NOV was issued in response to a
    voluntary investigation and submission by HOVENSA regarding
    potential non-compliance with the permit emissions limits for
    two pollutants. Any exceedances were minor from the perspective
    of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits.
    HOVENSA intends to work with the appropriate governmental agency
    to reach resolution of this matter and does not believe that it
    will result in material liability.

Registrant is one of over 60 companies that have received a
    directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental
    Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the
    sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking
    natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects
    Registrant, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk
    storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by the
    Registrant. EPA has also issued an Administrative Order on
    Consent relating to the same contamination. While NJDEP has
    suggested a remedial cost of over $900 million, the costs
    of remediation of the Passaic River sediments are the subject of
    a remedial investigation and feasibility study currently being
    conducted on a portion of the river by the EPA under an
    agreement with Registrant and over 40 other companies. Thus,
    remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based
    on currently known facts and circumstances, the Registrant does
    not believe that this matter will result in material liability
    because its terminal could not have contributed contamination
    along most of the river’s length and did not store or use
    contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river
    sediments, and because there are numerous other parties who will
    likely share in the cost of remediation and damages.

On or about July 15, 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp.
    (HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant, and
    HOVENSA, in which Registrant owns a 50% interest, each received
    a letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department
    of Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources
    Trustees, advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit
    against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
    alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
    damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous
    substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
    currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south
    shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had been
    operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed on
    May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands
    against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated
    industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix asserting
    that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and territorial
    statutory and common law for damages to natural resources. HOVIC
    and HOVENSA do not believe that this matter will result in a
    material liability as they believe that they have strong
    defenses to this complaint, and they intend to vigorously defend
    this matter.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notified the
    Registrant that on July 21, 2005, it commenced a private
    investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial
    Guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of
    the government of Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC has
    requested documents and information from the Registrant and
    other oil and gas companies that have operations or interests in
    Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC had previously been
    conducting an informal inquiry into such matters. The Registrant
    has been cooperating and continues to cooperate with the SEC
    investigation.

Registrant has been served with a complaint from the New York
    State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) relating to
    alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in Brooklyn, New
    York. The complaint, which seeks an order to shut down the
    terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts, alleges
    violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks,
    the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads, petroleum discharges
    and improper certification of tank repairs. DEC is also seeking
    relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in
    the New York metropolitan area. Registrant believes that many of
    the allegations are factually inaccurate or based on an
    incorrect interpretation of applicable law. Registrant has
    already addressed the primary conditions discussed in the



complaint. Registrant intends to vigorously contest the
    complaint, but is involved in settlement discussions with DEC.
    Any settlement is not expected to be material to the Corporation.

The Registrant periodically receives notices from EPA that it is
    a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
    legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
    this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
    jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
    claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation
    relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With
    respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s claims have been
    settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all
    cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of
    these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private
    parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot
    be predicted at this time due to the large number of other
    potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of

clean-up

cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
    and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
    to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of
    these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of
    them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such
    proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of
    the Securities and Exchange Commission. In management’s
    opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances,
    such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material
    adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
    operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P)
    and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment
    explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and
    sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment
    manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.

Net income in 2006 was $1,916 million compared with
    $1,242 million in 2005 and $977 million in 2004.
    Diluted earnings per share were $6.07 in 2006 compared with
    $3.98 in 2005 and $3.19 in 2004.

Exploration
    and Production

The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to
    profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and
    financially disciplined manner. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Corporation’s total proved reserves were
    1,243 million and 1,093 million barrels of oil
    equivalent. The following table summarizes the components of
    proved reserves as of December 31:

E&P net income was $1,763 million in 2006,
    $1,058 million in 2005 and $762 million in 2004. The
    improved results were primarily driven by higher average crude
    oil selling prices during the reporting period and lower hedged
    crude oil volumes in 2006. See further discussion in Comparison
    of Results on page 24.

Production totaled 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
    day (boepd) in 2006, 335,000 boepd in 2005 and 342,000 boepd in
    2004. The Corporation estimates that production will be
    approximately 370,000 boepd to 380,000 boepd in 2007.

During 2006, the Corporation commenced production from four new
    field developments:

•

The Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) natural gas
    fields in the United Kingdom came onstream in June 2006 and
    produced at a combined net rate of approximately 95,000 mcf per
    day in the second half of the year.

•

The Okume Complex development (Hess 85%) in Equatorial Guinea
    commenced production in December. Additional development
    activities are planned throughout 2007. The Corporation
    estimates that its net share of 2007 production will average
    approximately 20,000 boepd.

•

First production from the Phu Horm onshore gas project (Hess
    35%) in Thailand commenced in November. The Corporation
    estimates that its net share of 2007 production will average
    approximately 30,000 mcf per day.

•

Phase 2 production from the ACG fields (Hess 2.7%) in
    Azerbaijan also commenced during 2006.

The Corporation has several additional development projects that
    will also increase production in the future:

•

Development of the Shenzi field (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf
    of Mexico was sanctioned and first production is anticipated in
    the second half of 2009.



•

The Genghis Khan field (Hess 28%) was acquired by the Shenzi
    partners in February 2007. The field is part of the same
    geologic structure as the Shenzi development and first
    production is anticipated in the second half of 2007.

•

The Ujung Pangkah field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia is scheduled to
    commence production of natural gas by mid 2007 under an existing
    gas sales agreement for 440 million mcf (gross) over a
    20 year period with an expected plateau rate of
    100,000 mcf per day (gross). The Corporation’s plans
    for Ujung Pangkah in 2007 also include drilling additional
    development wells and the commencement of a crude oil
    development project.

•

Capital investments in the JDA (Hess 50%) will be made during
    2007 which will be primarily focused on facilities expansion and
    development drilling associated with the anticipated
    commencement of additional contracted gas sales of 400,000 mcf
    per day (gross) in 2008. It is anticipated that production
    associated with these additional gas sales will begin ramping up
    in the fourth quarter of 2007.

•

Development of the residual oil zone at the Seminole -
    San Andres Unit (Hess 34.3%) in the Permian Basin is
    expected to commence in 2007 and production is anticipated to
    begin in 2009.

During 2006, the Corporation’s exploration program had
    several successes, particularly in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico:

•

An exploration well on the Corporation’s Pony prospect on
    Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico encountered 475 feet of oil saturated sandstone in
    Miocene age reservoirs. Drilling of an appraisal sidetrack well
    on the Pony Prospect was completed in January 2007 which
    encountered 280 feet of oil saturated sandstone in Miocene
    age reservoirs after penetrating 60% of its geological
    objective. Drilling of the sidetrack well was stopped for
    mechanical reasons after successfully recovering 450 feet
    of conventional core. The Corporation is currently drilling an
    appraisal well about 7,400 feet northwest of the discovery
    well.

•

On the Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%) in the Mississippi
    Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a successful
    appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons approximately
    5 miles from the initial discovery well. The operator
    intends to drill two sidetrack wells in 2007 which will further
    delineate the field.

In addition, during 2006, the Corporation made the following
    acquisitions and also disposed of several producing properties:

•

In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis
    Group partners, re-entered its former oil and gas production
    operations in the Waha concessions (Hess 8.16%) in Libya. The
    re-entry terms include a

25-year

extension of the concessions and payments by the Corporation to
    the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $359 million. The
    Corporation’s net share of 2006 production from Libya
    averaged 23,000 barrels of oil per day.

•

The Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater
    section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the
    West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation
    has a

25-year

development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four
    existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
    opportunities.

•

During 2006, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests
    in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin in Texas
    and New Mexico and certain U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas
    producing assets. These asset sales generated total proceeds of
    $444 million after closing adjustments and an aggregate
    after-tax gain of $236 million ($369 million before
    income taxes). Total net production from assets sold was
    approximately 8,000 boepd at the time of sale.

Marketing
    and Refining

The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to
    deliver consistent financial performance and generate free cash
    flow. M&R net income was $390 million in 2006,
    $515 million in 2005 and $451 million in 2004. Total
    Marketing and Refining earnings decreased in 2006 due to lower
    margins on refined product sales. Refining



operations contributed net income of $236 million in 2006,
    $346 million in 2005 and $302 million in 2004.
    Profitability in 2006 was adversely affected by lower refined
    product margins. Refining facilities at the HOVENSA joint
    venture and at Port Reading performed reliably in 2006 with the
    exception of 22 days of unplanned downtime at HOVENSA early
    in the year. The Corporation received cash distributions from
    HOVENSA totaling $400 million in 2006 and $275 million
    in 2005.

In 2006, the Corporation’s Port Reading facility completed
    its $72 million program for complying with low-sulfur
    gasoline requirements. Capital expenditures to comply with
    low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are
    estimated to be approximately $420 million, of which
    $360 million has been incurred through the end of 2006 with
    the remainder to be spent in 2007.

Marketing earnings were $108 million in 2006,
    $136 million in 2005 and $112 million in 2004. During
    2006 and 2005, the Corporation selectively expanded its energy
    marketing business by acquiring natural gas and electricity
    customer accounts.

Liquidity
    and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $3,491 million in 2006 compared with $1,840 million in
    2005. At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents
    totaled $383 million compared with $315 million at
    December 31, 2005. Total debt was $3,772 million at
    December 31, 2006 compared with $3,785 million at
    December 31, 2005. The Corporation’s debt to
    capitalization ratio at December 31, 2006 was 31.7%
    compared with 37.6% at the end of 2005. The Corporation has debt
    maturities of $27 million in 2007 and $28 million in
    2008.

In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
    transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
    reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
    after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
    earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
    preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
    they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
    the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
    the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to
    pre-tax amounts.

The following items of income (expense), on an after-tax basis,
    are included in net income:

After considering the Exploration and Production items in the
    table on page 23, the remaining changes in Exploration and
    Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in
    selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration
    expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.

Selling prices:

Higher average crude
    oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased
    Exploration and Production revenues by approximately
    $1,900 million in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2005, the
    change in average selling prices increased revenues by
    approximately $870 million compared with 2004.

The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows:

The after-tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by
    $285 million ($449 million before income taxes) in
    2006, $989 million ($1,582 million before income
    taxes) in 2005 and $583 million ($935 million before
    income taxes) in 2004.

Production and sales volumes:

The
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was
    359,000 boepd in 2006, 335,000 boepd in 2005 and 342,000 boepd
    in 2004. The Corporation anticipates that its 2007 production
    will average between 370,000 and 380,000 boepd. The
    Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows:

Barrels of oil equivalent*
    (thousands of barrels per day)




*

Reflects natural gas production
    converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf
    equals one barrel).

Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was
    lower in 2006 due to asset sales and natural decline. Production
    in Europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased
    production from Russia and new production from the Atlantic and
    Cromarty natural gas fields in the United Kingdom, which offset
    lower production due to maintenance and natural decline.
    Increased crude oil production in Africa in 2006 was primarily
    due to production from Libya. Natural gas production in Asia was
    higher in 2006 due to increased production from the JDA.



Higher sales volumes increased revenue by approximately
    $400 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Decreased sales
    volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately
    $80 million in 2005 compared with 2004.

Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and
    amortization:

Cash operating costs,
    consisting of production expenses and general and administrative
    expenses, increased by $322 million in 2006 and
    $147 million in 2005 compared with the corresponding
    amounts in prior years, excluding the charges for vacated leased
    office space and hurricane related costs discussed below.
    Production expenses increased in 2006 and 2005, principally
    reflecting higher maintenance expenses, increased costs of
    services, materials and fuel and higher production taxes
    resulting from higher oil prices. Production expenses also
    increased in 2006 due to the re-entry into Libya and continued
    expansion of operations in Russia and the JDA. Depreciation,
    depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2006,
    principally reflecting increased production volumes and higher
    per barrel rates, due to new production from the Atlantic and
    Cromarty fields and higher asset retirement obligations.
    Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in
    2005 versus 2004, principally due to higher per barrel rates.

Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $10.92 in
    2006, $9.07 in 2005 and $7.67 in 2004. Cash operating costs for
    2007 are estimated to be in the range of $12.00 to
    $13.00 per barrel, reflecting industry-wide cost increases
    and the timing of achieving peak production from new fields.
    Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil
    equivalent were $8.85 in 2006, $7.88 in 2005 and $7.34 in 2004.
    Depreciation, depletion and related costs for 2007 are expected
    to be in the range of $10.00 to $11.00 per barrel. The
    anticipated increase is due to new fields, including the Okume
    Complex, which has allocated acquisition cost in its depreciable
    base.

Exploration expenses:

Exploration
    expenses were higher in 2006, primarily reflecting higher dry
    hole costs. Exploration expenses were higher in 2005 compared
    with 2004 as a result of increased drilling and seismic activity.

Income Taxes:

The effective income tax
    rate for Exploration and Production operations was 53% in 2006,
    41% in 2005 and 43% in 2004. After considering the items in the
    table below, the effective income tax rates were 54% in 2006,
    42% in 2005 and 46% in 2004. The increase in the 2006 effective
    income tax rate was primarily due to taxes on Libyan operations
    and the increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum
    operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. During 2006,
    the Algerian government amended its hydrocarbon tax laws
    effective August 1, 2006 and the Corporation recorded a net
    charge of $6 million for the estimated impact of the tax.
    The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2007 is
    expected to be in the range of 52% to 56%.

Other:

After-tax foreign currency gains
    were $10 million ($21 million before income taxes) in
    2006, $20 million ($3 million loss before income
    taxes) in 2005, and $6 million ($29 million before
    income taxes) in 2004.

Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the

2006:

The gains from asset sales relate to the
    sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties
    located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore
    Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated
    leased office space in the United Kingdom. The income tax
    adjustment represents a one-time adjustment to the
    Corporation’s deferred tax liability resulting from an
    increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the
    United Kingdom from 10% to 20%.



2005:

The gains from asset sales represent the
    disposal of non-producing properties in the United Kingdom and
    the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased
    interest in the Pangkah development in Indonesia. The
    Corporation incurred incremental expenses in 2005, principally
    repair costs and higher insurance premiums, as a result of
    hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are included in
    production expenses in the income statement. The income tax
    adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a
    reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement
    in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the
    favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset
    sale, which is reflected in non-operating income in the income
    statement.

2004:

The Corporation recognized gains from
    the sales of an office building in Scotland, a non-producing
    property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties.
    It also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a
    change in tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation recorded
    an after-tax charge for vacated leased office space in the
    United Kingdom and severance costs, which is reflected in
    general and administrative expenses in the income statement.

The Corporation’s future Exploration and Production
    earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political
    risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural
    gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation,
    exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in
    foreign exchange and income tax rates.

Marketing
    and Refining

Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to
    $390 million in 2006, $515 million in 2005 and
    $451 million in 2004. After considering the Marketing and
    Refining items in the table on page 23, the earnings
    amounted to $390 million in 2006, $491 million in 2005
    and $439 million in 2004 and are discussed in the
    paragraphs below. The Corporation’s downstream operations
    include HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a
    subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is
    accounted for using the equity method. Additional Marketing and
    Refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility
    in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline
    stations, energy marketing and trading operations.

Refining:

Refining earnings, which
    consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
    results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note
    receivable from PDVSA and other miscellaneous items were
    $236 million in 2006, $346 million in 2005 and
    $302 million in 2004.

The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s net income was
    $125 million ($203 million before income taxes) in
    2006 and $231 million ($376 million before income
    taxes) in 2005 and $216 million ($244 million before
    income taxes) in 2004. The lower earnings in 2006 were
    principally due to lower refined product margins. Refined
    product margins were higher in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2006
    and 2005, the Corporation provided income taxes at the Virgin
    Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on HOVENSA’s income and the
    interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA. In 2004,
    income taxes on HOVENSA’s earnings were partially offset by
    available loss carryforwards. In 2006, the fluid catalytic
    cracking unit was shutdown for approximately 22 days of
    unscheduled maintenance. During 2005, a crude unit and the fluid
    catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for
    approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance. Cash
    distributions from HOVENSA were $400 million in 2006,
    $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004.

Pre-tax interest on the PDVSA note was $15 million,
    $20 million and $25 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Interest income is reflected in non-operating
    income in the income statement. At December 31, 2006, the
    remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $137 million, which
    is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009.

Port Reading’s after-tax earnings were $99 million in
    2006, $100 million in 2005 and $60 million in 2004.
    Higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower
    margins in 2006 compared with 2005. Refined product margins were
    higher in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2005, the Port Reading
    facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance.

Marketing:

Marketing operations, which
    consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing
    activities, generated income of $108 million in 2006,
    $112 million in 2005 and $100 million in 2004,
    excluding the income from liquidation of LIFO inventories and
    the charge related to a customer bankruptcy described below. The
    decrease in 2006 primarily reflects lower margins on refined
    product sales. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher
    margins and increased sales volumes compared with 2004. Total
    refined product sales volumes were 459,000 barrels per day
    in 2006, 456,000 barrels per day in 2005 and
    428,000 barrels per day in 2004.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
    derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
    its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
    trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the
    trading partnership, amounted to income of $46 million in
    2006, $33 million in 2005 and $37 million in 2004.
    Before income taxes, the trading income amounted to
    $83 million in 2006, $60 million in 2005 and
    $72 million in 2004 and is included in operating revenues
    in the income statement.

Marketing expenses increased due to higher expenses resulting
    from an increased number of retail convenience stores, growth in
    energy marketing operations, and higher utility and compensation
    related costs.

Reported Marketing and Refining earnings include the following
    items of income (expense) before and after income taxes:

In 2005 and 2004, Marketing and Refining earnings include income
    from the liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories. In 2005,
    earnings include a charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a
    customer in the utility industry, which is included in marketing
    expenses.

The Corporation’s future Marketing and Refining earnings
    may be impacted by volatility in Marketing and Refining margins,
    competitive industry conditions, government regulatory changes,
    credit risk and supply and demand factors, including the effects
    of weather.

Excluding the items affecting comparability between periods, the
    increase in corporate expenses in 2006 compared to 2005
    primarily reflects the expensing of stock options commencing
    January 1, 2006 and increases in insurance costs. Recurring
    after-tax corporate expenses in 2007 are estimated to be in the
    range of $115 to $125 million.

In 2005, the American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one-time
    reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of
    eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a United States
    parent. The Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of
    previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the
    recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The
    pre-tax amount of bond repurchase premiums in 2005 was
    $39 million and is reflected in non-operating income in the
    income statement. The pre-tax amount of the 2004 corporate
    insurance accrual was $20 million and is reflected in
    non-operating income.

After-tax interest expense in 2007 is expected to be in the
    range of $170 to $180 million, principally reflecting an
    anticipated decrease in capitalized interest due to the
    achievement of first production from several development
    projects.

Sales
    and Other Operating Revenues

Sales and other operating revenues totaled $28,067 million
    in 2006, an increase of 23% compared with 2005. The increase
    reflects higher selling prices of crude oil, higher sales
    volumes and reduced crude oil hedge positions in Exploration and
    Production activities and higher selling prices and sales
    volumes in marketing activities. In 2005, sales and other
    operating revenues totaled $22,747 million, an increase of
    36% compared with 2004. This increase principally reflects
    higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas in
    Exploration and Production and higher



selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. The
    change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in
    sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased
    natural gas.

Operating Activities:

In 2006, net cash
    provided by operating activities, including changes in operating
    assets and liabilities, was $3,491 million, an increase of
    $1,651 million from 2005, principally reflecting higher
    earnings, changes in working capital accounts and increased
    distributions from HOVENSA. Net cash provided by operating
    activities was $1,840 million in 2005 compared with
    $1,903 million in 2004. The change was due to higher
    earnings in 2005, offset by a decrease from changes in operating
    assets and liabilities, principally working capital, of
    $408 million. The Corporation received cash distributions
    from HOVENSA of $400 million in 2006, $275 million in
    2005 and $88 million in 2004.

    and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya
    and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the
    West Med Block in Egypt.



Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million,
    including the sale of the Corporation’s interests in
    certain producing properties in the Permian Basin and onshore
    U.S. Gulf Coast. Proceeds from asset sales were
    $74 million and $57 million in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, principally from the sale of non-producing
    properties.

Financing Activities:

The Corporation
    reduced debt by $13 million in 2006, $50 million in
    2005 and $106 million in 2004. The net reductions in debt
    in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were funded by available cash and cash
    flow from operations. In 2005, bond repurchases of
    $600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving
    credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign
    earnings to the United States.

Dividends paid were $161 million in 2006, $159 million
    in 2005 and $157 million in 2004. The Corporation received
    proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling
    $40 million, $62 million and $90 million in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

Future Capital Requirements and Resources

The Corporation anticipates $4.0 billion in capital and
    exploratory expenditures in 2007, of which $3.9 billion
    relates to Exploration and Production operations. The
    Corporation has maturities of long-term debt of $27 million
    in 2007 and $28 million in 2008. The Corporation
    anticipates that it can fund its 2007 operations, including
    capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and
    required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand, cash flow
    from operations and its available credit facilities.

During 2006, the Corporation amended and restated its existing
    syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility) to increase
    the credit line to $3.0 billion from $2.5 billion and
    extend the term to May 2011 from December 2009. The facility can
    be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2006, the Corporation has $2.7 billion
    available under this facility.

The Corporation has a

364-day

asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts
    receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations, which are
    sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this
    financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow
    up to $800 million, subject to the availability of
    sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31,
    2006, the Corporation has $318 million in outstanding
    borrowings under this facility which was collateralized by
    approximately $1,100 million of receivables. These
    receivables are not available to pay the general obligations of
    the Corporation before repayment of outstanding borrowings under
    the

asset-backed

facility.

The Corporation has additional unused lines of credit of
    approximately $370 million, primarily for letters of
    credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The
    Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may
    issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
    preferred stock.

Outstanding letters of credit at December 31, were as

Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow up to
    an additional $9.7 billion for the construction or
    acquisition of assets at December 31, 2006. The Corporation
    has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.2 billion
    of secured debt at December 31, 2006 under the loan
    agreement covenants. At December 31, 2006, the maximum
    amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from
    borrowings under the loan agreement covenants is
    $3.7 billion.



Credit Ratings

There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the
    Corporation’s debt. Two credit agencies have assigned an
    investment grade rating to the Corporation’s debt and one
    agency has rated it below investment grade. The interest rate
    and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the
    Corporation’s credit rating changes. In addition, if any
    one of the three rating agencies were to reduce their rating on
    the Corporation’s senior unsecured debt, margin
    requirements with non-trading and trading counterparties at
    December 31, 2006 would increase by up to approximately
    $140 million.

(b)

The Corporation intends to
    continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA.
    Estimated future purchases amount to approximately
    $4.2 billion annually using year-end 2006 prices.

In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
    commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
    HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
    sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future
    supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market
    prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA,
    and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included
    are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional
    gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail
    marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
    facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to
    purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity for use
    in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing
    business. These commitments were computed based on year-end
    market prices.

The table also reflects that portion of the Corporation’s
    planned $4 billion capital investment program for 2007 that
    is contractually committed at December 31, 2006.
    Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for
    transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production
    expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term
    liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the
    balance sheet at December 31, including asset retirement
    obligations and pension plan funding requirements.

At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had a remaining
    accrual of $49 million for vacated leased office space
    costs. In 2006, the Corporation recorded an additional
    $30 million charge for vacated leased office space
    ($18 million after income taxes) and made payments of
    $12 million. At December 31, 2005, the accrual was
    $31 million after reduction for payments of $8 million
    during 2005.

The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring
    in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a
    retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately
    $140 million as of December 31, 2006.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
    HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
    PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates
    based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices
    and at December 31, 2006, amounted to $229 million. In
    addition, the Corporation has



agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to
    the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt
    obligations.

At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has
    $3,427 million of letters of credit principally relating to
    accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties
    recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the Corporation is
    contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees
    of the debt of other entities directly related to its business,
    as follows:

    $57 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation
    owns a 2.36% interest.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance
    sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
    Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is
    $490 million at December 31, 2006 compared with
    $480 million at December 31, 2005. The
    Corporation’s December 31, 2006 debt to capitalization
    ratio would increase from 31.7% to 34.4% if these leases were
    included as debt.

    Contingencies”

    Venture,” and note 16, “Guarantees and
    Contingencies,” in the notes to the financial statements.

Stock
    Split

On May 3, 2006, the Corporation’s shareholders voted
    to increase the number of authorized common shares from
    200 million to 600 million and the board of directors
    declared a

three-for-one

stock split. The stock split was completed in the form of a
    stock dividend that was issued on May 31, 2006 to
    shareholders of record on May 17, 2006. The common share
    par value remained at $1.00 per share. All common share and
    per share amounts in the financial statements and notes and
    management’s discussion and analysis are on an after-split
    basis for all periods presented.

Foreign
    Operations

The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities
    in the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea,
    Algeria, Malaysia, Thailand, Russia, Gabon, Azerbaijan,
    Indonesia, Libya, Egypt and other countries. Therefore, the
    Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign
    operations. These exposures include political risk (including
    tax law changes) and currency risk.

HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by
    Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a
    refinery in the United States Virgin Islands. In the past, there
    have been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the
    availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining
    operations; however, these disruptions did not have a material
    adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial position. The
    Corporation has a note receivable of $137 million at
    December 31, 2006 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments
    are current and the Corporation anticipates collection of the
    remaining balance.

Subsequent
    Events

In February 2007, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a
    28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652
    and 608 for $371 million. The Genghis Khan development is
    part of the same geologic structure as the Shenzi development
    (Hess 28%) and first production from this development is
    expected in the second half of 2007.



Accounting
    Policies

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
    assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
    accounting methods used can affect net income,
    stockholders’ equity and various financial statement
    ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies
    generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
    after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
    producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if
    there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational
    viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged
    to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing
    reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project
    include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations
    for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with
    governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for
    additional drilling and other factors.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:

The
    determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant
    element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration
    and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves
    affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation
    rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as
    impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
    accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
    requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
    reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
    producible, government and project operator approvals must be
    obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior
    management or the board of directors, must commit to fund the
    project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation
    and reporting process involves an annual independent third party
    reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals
    of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
    estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
    directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
    technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
    based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
    technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
    throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
    guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
    practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
    to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the
    estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary
    Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 69

Disclosures about Oil
    and Gas Producing Activities

(FAS No. 69) are
    determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and
    MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal
    estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with
    engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production
    histories and other information necessary for the reserve
    determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s
    technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information
    provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review
    the final reserve estimates issued by D&M.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
    Goodwill:

As explained below there are
    significant differences in the way long-lived assets and
    goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas
    fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable
    cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are
    largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and
    liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets
    are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash
    flow



estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is
    recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated
    fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated
    future net cash flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
    net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
    future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
    historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
    projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted
    at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected
    production volumes represent reserves, including probable
    reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount
    of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and
    timing of production are consistent with internal projections
    and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices
    used for determining asset impairments will generally differ
    from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future
    net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use
    of actual prices on the last day of the year.

The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived
    Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its
    best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery
    factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the
    timing of future production, which are updated each time an
    impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have
    impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas
    fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil
    and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset
    impairments.

In accordance with FAS No. 142

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

(FAS No. 142), the
    Corporation’s goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for
    impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit
    level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure
    goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner
    in which the business is managed. The Corporation’s
    goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and Production operating
    segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be
    recovered through the operation of that segment.

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the Exploration
    and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted
    anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known
    developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value
    of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium
    to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential
    synergies including cost savings, access to new business
    opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and
    increased market share. The Corporation also considers the
    relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production
    companies.

The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and
    Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and
    gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and
    market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and
    natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a
    decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production
    operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived
    assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
    testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
    would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the
    Exploration and Production segment.

Segments:

The Corporation has two
    operating segments, Exploration and Production and Marketing and
    Refining. Management has determined that these are its operating
    segments because, in accordance with FAS No. 131

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information

(FAS No. 131), these are the segments
    of the Corporation (i) that engage in business activities
    from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred,
    (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the
    Corporation’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make
    decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and
    assess its performance and (iii) for which discrete
    financial information is available. The Chairman of the Board
    and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, is the CODM as
    defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for
    performing the functions within the Corporation of allocating
    resources to, and assessing the performance of, the
    Corporation’s operating segments.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading
    activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In
    trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a
    consolidated



partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives, including
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of
    future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under
    FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in earnings.
    Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash
    flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of
    firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of
    changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash
    flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive
    income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are
    reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged
    item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of
    changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow
    hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value
    of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized
    currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related
    hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying
    amount and recognized currently in earnings.

Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair
    value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before
    they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on
    an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify
    for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective
    effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical
    simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical
    observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot
    prices.

Income Taxes:

Judgments are required in
    the determination and recognition of income tax assets and
    liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net
    operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including
    the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for
    those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax
    assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and
    tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments
    are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being
    realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
    is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that
    is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of
    deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal
    periods for temporary differences, available carryforward
    periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable
    income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the
    existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of
    future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas
    reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the
    Corporation’s internal business forecasts.

Changes
    in Accounting Policies

Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted the
    provisions of FAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS No. 123R). FAS No. 123R requires
    that the fair value of all stock-based compensation to
    employees, including grants of stock options, be expensed over
    the vesting period. Through December 31, 2005, the
    Corporation used the intrinsic value method to account for
    employee stock options. Because the exercise prices of employee
    stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the stock
    on the date of grant, the Corporation did not recognize
    compensation expense under the intrinsic value method. See
    note 9, “Share-Based Compensation,” in the notes
    to the consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued FAS No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans

(FAS No. 158). FAS No. 158
    requires recognition on the balance sheet of the overfunded or
    underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan
    measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
    and the benefit obligation. As required, the Corporation
    prospectively adopted the provisions of FAS No. 158 on
    December 31, 2006. See note 11, “Retirement
    Plans,” in the notes to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) AUG
    AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance
    Activities.

This FSP eliminates the previously acceptable

accrue-in-advance

method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As a result,
    the Corporation will retrospectively change its method of
    accounting for



refinery turnarounds on January 1, 2007, the effective date
    of this pronouncement, to recognize expenses associated with
    refinery turnarounds when such costs are incurred. Under the
    retrospective method of adoption, the Corporation expects to
    increase 2006 earnings by approximately $4 million, reduce
    2005 earnings by approximately $16 million and increase
    retained earnings as of January 1, 2005 by approximately
    $66 million.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(FIN 48).
    FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and
    measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be
    taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also requires additional
    disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions. As
    required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of
    FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The Corporation has
    not concluded its evaluation of the impact of adopting
    FIN 48 on its results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(FAS No. 157).
    FAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which
    applies broadly to financial and non-financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative
    accounting pronouncements. Additionally, the standard requires
    increased disclosure of the methods of determining fair value.
    The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adoption
    on its financial statements and, as required, the Corporation
    will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 157 effective
    January 1, 2008.

Environment,
    Health and Safety

The Corporation has implemented a values-based,
    socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment,
    health and safety performance and making a positive impact on
    communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s
    environment, health, safety and social responsibility
    (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety
    management systems that help protect the Corporation’s
    workforce, customers and local communities. The
    Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or
    exceed international standards and are intended to promote
    internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and
    continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved
    performance may, in the short-term, increase the
    Corporation’s operating costs and could also require
    increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to
    assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to
    enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity
    and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral
    benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation
    has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit
    facilities, train employees and to generally meet corporate
    EHS & SR goals.

The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and
    elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent
    years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that have
    already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and
    additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in
    diesel fuel went into effect in 2006. Additional reductions in
    gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration.
    Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more
    stringent regulation in future years and as such may require
    additional capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures necessary to comply with low-sulfur
    gasoline requirements at Port Reading were $72 million, of
    which $23 million was spent in 2005 and the remainder was
    spent in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur
    gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently
    expected to be approximately $420 million in total,
    $360 million of which has already been spent and the
    remainder is expected to be spent in 2007. HOVENSA has and
    continues to plan to finance these capital expenditures through
    cash flow from operations.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 eliminated the Clean Air
    Act’s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated
    gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific
    quantities of renewable content in gasoline. Many states have
    also enacted bans on the use of MTBE in gasoline, many of which
    will take effect between 2007 and 2009. As a result, several
    companies have announced their intention to cease using MTBE,
    since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to
    comply with the Clean Air Act and does not meet the new
    renewable content requirement. In response to these changes in
    the gasoline marketplace, the Corporation and HOVENSA phased out
    the use of ether based oxygenates during 2006. Both companies
    are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether
    unit processing capabilities, which may necessitate additional
    capital investments.



As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in
    2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the
    U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining
    Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed
    to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries.
    Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing
    these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control
    over 77% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with
    the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these
    discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience
    increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to
    air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow
    for controls to be phased in over several years.

HOVENSA is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the
    refinery. This project will significantly enhance the
    refinery’s ability to treat wastewater and better protect
    the marine environment of St. Croix. The cost to complete the
    project is approximately $120 million, of which
    $55 million has already been incurred.

The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and
    reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including
    carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this
    program are significant, not only from the standpoint of
    technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of
    adequately measuring the Corporation’s greenhouse gas
    inventory. The Corporation has completed a revised monitoring
    protocol which will allow for better measurement of
    “greenhouse gases” and is conducting an independently
    verified audit of its emissions. Once completed, the monitoring
    protocol will allow for better control of these emissions and
    assist the Corporation in complying with any future regulatory
    restrictions.

The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for
    environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to
    existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be
    necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore
    exploration and production facilities, refineries (including
    solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to
    the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not
    currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the
    Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party.

The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
    remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable. At year-end 2006, the Corporation’s
    reserve for its estimated environmental liability was
    approximately $75 million. The Corporation expects that
    existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately
    cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The
    Corporation’s remediation spending was $15 million in
    2006 and 2005 and $12 million in 2004. Capital expenditures
    for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and
    local environmental standards, other than for low sulfur
    projects discussed above, were $22 million in 2006,
    $3 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2004.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including
    references to the Corporation’s future results of
    operations and financial position, liquidity and capital
    resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax
    rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and
    environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and
    contractual obligations and contingencies include
    forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are
    based on the Corporation’s current understanding and
    assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about
    the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures
    because of changes in market conditions, government actions and
    other factors.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
    to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
    natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
    changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
    disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as
    non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading
    operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a
    trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to
    commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil,
    natural gas and refined products. The following describes how
    these risks are controlled and managed.

Controls:

The Corporation maintains a
    control environment under the direction of its chief risk
    officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the
    Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls
    include



volumetric, term and

value-at-risk

limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use
    of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored
    daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to
    senior management. The Corporation’s risk management
    department also performs independent verifications of sources of
    fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls
    apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading
    activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The
    Corporation’s treasury department administers foreign
    exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs.

Instruments:

The Corporation primarily
    uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward
    contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based
    securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These
    contracts are generally widely traded instruments with
    standardized terms. The following describes these instruments
    and how the Corporation uses them:

•

Forward Commodity Contracts:

The forward
    purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the
    Corporation’s normal activities. At settlement date, the
    notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical
    delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated
    as normal purchase and sale contracts under
    FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market
    risk disclosures.

•

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:

Forward
    contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the
    British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign
    currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed
    amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange
    rate on a certain date.

•

Exchange Traded Contracts:

The Corporation
    uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number
    of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are
    settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to
    exchange position limits.

•

Swaps:

The Corporation uses financially
    settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging
    and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are
    determined based on underlying commodity prices and are
    typically settled over the life of the contract.

•

Options:

Options on various underlying energy
    commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts
    and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the
    Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk
    of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying
    the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a
    premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the
    favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These
    premiums are a component of the fair value of the options.

•

Energy Securities:

Energy securities include
    energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or
    government or related derivatives on these securities.

Value-at-Risk:

The
    Corporation uses

value-at-risk

to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and
    non-trading activities. The

value-at-risk

model uses historical simulation and the results represent the
    potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence
    level. The model captures both first and second order
    sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the

value-at-risk

results for trading and non-trading activities. These



results may vary from time to time as strategies change in
    trading activities or hedging levels change in non-trading
    activities.

Non-Trading:

The Corporation’s
    non-trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and
    natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the
    selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future
    production and the related gains or losses are an integral part
    of the Corporation’s selling prices. Following is a summary
    of the Corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at
    December 31, 2006:

There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production
    at December 31, 2006. As market conditions change, the
    Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. The Corporation
    also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum
    products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses
    futures and swaps to manage the risk in its marketing activities.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
    December 31, 2006 includes after-tax unrealized deferred
    losses of $1,338 million primarily related to crude oil
    contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales.
    The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in
    accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are
    recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.

The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
    exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
    forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling
    and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2006, the
    Corporation had $729 million of notional value foreign
    exchange contracts maturing in 2007. The fair value of the
    foreign exchange contracts was a receivable of $51 million
    at December 31, 2006. The change in fair value of the
    foreign exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates
    is estimated to be approximately $80 million at
    December 31, 2006.

The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,772 million
    has a fair value of $4,105 million at December 31,
    2006. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the
    fair value of debt by approximately $300 million at
    December 31, 2006.

Trading:

In trading activities, the
    Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and
    refined product prices. The trading partnership in which the
    Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy



commodities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are
    consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also
    takes trading positions for its own account. The information
    that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the
    Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.

Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
    the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are

marked-to-market

and are reflected in income currently. Total realized gains for
    the year amounted to $721 million ($297 million of
    realized losses for 2005). The following table provides an
    assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of
    trading activities and represents 100% of the trading
    partnership and other trading activities.

The Corporation uses observable market values for determining
    the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where
    actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources
    are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in
    actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets
    and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are
    based on internal models incorporating underlying market
    information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The
    Corporation’s risk management department regularly compares
    valuations to independent sources and models.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
    as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
    on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that Hess Corporation (formerly, Amerada
    Hess Corporation) and consolidated subsidiaries maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Hess Corporation’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Hess
    Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Hess
    Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and
    consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, and
    our report dated February 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on these statements.

Report of

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    Hess Corporation (formerly, Amerada Hess Corporation) and
    consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our
    audits also included the Financial Statement Schedule listed in
    the Index at Item 8. These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
    consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related Financial Statement Schedule, when considered in
    relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment,
    effective January 1, 2006. Also as discussed in
    Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Corporation adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
    effective December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Hess Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    These activities are conducted in the United States, United
    Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Malaysia,
    Thailand, Russia, Gabon, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Libya, Egypt and
    other countries. In addition, the Corporation manufactures,
    purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum and
    other energy products. The Corporation owns 50% of HOVENSA
    L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a refinery joint venture in the United States
    Virgin Islands. An additional refining facility, terminals and
    retail gasoline stations, most of which include convenience
    stores, are located on the East Coast of the United States.

In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in
    the income statement. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates. Among the estimates made by management are oil and
    gas reserves, asset valuations, depreciable lives, pension
    liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset
    retirement obligations and income taxes.

Principles of Consolidation:

The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess
    Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
    a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
    The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
    and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
    consolidated.

Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned, including
    HOVENSA, are stated at cost of acquisition plus the
    Corporation’s equity in undistributed net income since
    acquisition. The Corporation’s equity in net income of
    these companies is included in non-operating income in the
    income statement. The Corporation consolidates the trading
    partnership in which it owns a 50% voting interest and over
    which it exercises control.

Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
    consolidation.

Revenue Recognition:

The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas,
    petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to
    the customer. Sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes
    in the consolidated statement of income. The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas
    properties based on sales to customers. Differences between
    natural gas volumes sold and the Corporation’s share of
    natural gas production are not material. Revenues from natural
    gas and electricity sales by the Corporation’s marketing
    operations are recognized based on meter readings and estimated
    deliveries to customers since the last meter reading.

In its exploration and production activities, the Corporation
    enters into crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the
    same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one
    another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality.
    Similarly, in its marketing activities, the Corporation also
    enters into refined product purchase and sale transactions with
    the same counterparty. These arrangements are reported net in
    sales and other operating revenue in the consolidated statement
    of income.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading
    activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices
    of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading
    activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated
    partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives, including
    futures, forwards, options and swaps based on expectations of
    future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under
    FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected
    future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges)
    or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective
    portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of
    other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow
    hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that
    the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
    portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in
    fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are
    recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of
    the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to
    its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
    equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are
    readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three
    months or less when acquired.

Inventories:

Crude oil and refined
    product inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
    For inventories valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally
    the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) inventory method. Inventories of merchandise,
    materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost
    or market.

Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. In accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position

19-1,

Accounting for Suspended Well Costs

, which amended
    FAS No. 19,

Financial Accounting and Reporting by
    Oil and Gas Producing Companies

(FAS No. 19),
    exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is
    completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity
    of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and
    (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the
    reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
    project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is
    substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of
    a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense.
    Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the
    economic and operating viability of a project include commitment
    of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts
    with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and
    contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other
    factors.

Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization:

The Corporation records
    depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties
    using the units of production method over proved oil and gas
    reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas
    production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of
    production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves.
    Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on
    the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Retail
    gas stations and equipment related to a leased property, are
    depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed the
    remaining lease period. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped
    oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other
    factors.

Capitalized Interest:

Interest from
    external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using
    the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the
    project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
    use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from
    the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful
    lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of
    the underlying assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation accounts for asset retirement obligations as
    required by FAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations

and FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations.

Under these standards, a liability is
    recognized for the fair value of legally required asset
    retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets in the
    period in which the retirement



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

obligations are incurred. In addition, the fair value of any
    legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is
    recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
    Corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as
    part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas
    properties at a field level, for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may
    not be recovered. If the carrying amounts are not expected to be
    recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the assets are
    impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
    impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
    determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In
    the case of oil and gas fields, the net present value of future
    cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future
    prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical
    prices and published forward prices, applied to projected
    production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate
    commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production
    volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves,
    expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital
    expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of
    production are consistent with internal projections and other
    externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for
    determining asset impairments will generally differ from the
    year-end prices used in the standardized measure of discounted
    future net cash flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The
    Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    other than temporary decline in value has occurred. The amount
    of the impairment is based on quoted market prices, where
    available, or other valuation techniques.

Impairment of Goodwill:

In accordance
    with FAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

, goodwill cannot be amortized; however, it is tested
    for impairment annually in the fourth quarter. This impairment
    test is calculated at the reporting unit level, which is the
    Exploration and Production segment for the Corporation’s
    goodwill. The Corporation identifies potential impairments by
    comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its book
    value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting
    unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If
    the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Corporation
    calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied
    fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If the implied
    fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment would be recorded.

Maintenance and Repairs:

Maintenance
    and repairs are expensed as incurred. The estimated costs of
    refinery turnarounds are accrued. Capital improvements are
    recorded as additions in property, plant and equipment.

Environmental Expenditures:

The
    Corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs to
    remediate existing conditions related to past operations when
    the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The
    Corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase
    the life or efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent
    future environmental contamination.

Share-Based Compensation:

Effective
    January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted
    FAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS No. 123R) which requires that compensation
    expense be recorded for all share based payments to employees.
    The Corporation used the modified prospective application method
    for its adoption of FAS No. 123R, which requires that
    compensation cost be recorded for restricted stock, previously
    awarded unvested stock options outstanding at January 1,
    2006 based on the grant date fair-values used for disclosure
    purposes under previous accounting requirements, and stock
    options awarded subsequent to January 1, 2006 determined
    under the provisions of FAS No. 123R. The cumulative
    effect on prior years of this change in accounting was
    immaterial. Prior to adoption of FAS No. 123R, the
    Corporation recorded compensation expense for restricted common
    stock awards and used the intrinsic value method to account for
    employee stock options. Because the exercise prices of employee
    stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the stock
    on the date of grant, compensation expense was not recorded
    under this method. All share-based compensation expense is
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of
    the awards.



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are
    determined using the liability method. The Corporation regularly
    assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on
    estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax
    planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the
    available carryforward periods for net operating losses and
    other factors. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The
    U.S. dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in
    which business is conducted) for most foreign operations.
    Adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and
    liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency
    into the functional currency are recorded in other non-operating
    income. For operations that do not use the U.S. dollar as
    the functional currency, adjustments resulting from translating
    foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars
    are recorded in a separate component of stockholders’
    equity entitled accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Recently Issued Accounting
    Standards:

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major
    Maintenance Activities.

This FSP eliminates the
    previously acceptable

accrue-in-advance

method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As a result,
    the Corporation will retrospectively change its method of
    accounting for refinery turnarounds on January 1, 2007, the
    effective date of this pronouncement, to recognize expenses
    associated with refinery turnarounds when such costs are
    incurred. Under the retrospective method of adoption, the
    Corporation expects to increase 2006 earnings by approximately
    $4 million, reduce 2005 earnings by approximately
    $16 million and increase retained earnings as of
    January 1, 2005 by approximately $66 million.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(FIN 48).
    FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and
    measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be
    taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also requires additional
    disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions. As
    required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of
    FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The Corporation has
    not concluded its evaluation of the impact of adopting of
    FIN 48 on its results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(FAS No. 157).
    FAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which
    applies broadly to financial and non-financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative
    accounting pronouncements. Additionally, the standard requires
    increased disclosure of the methods of determining fair value.
    The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adoption
    on its financial statements and, as required, will adopt the
    provisions of FAS No. 157 effective January 1,
    2008.

Exploration and Production:

In the
    first quarter of 2006, the Corporation completed the sale of its
    interests in certain oil and gas producing properties located in
    the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico for $358 million.
    This asset sale resulted in an after-tax gain of
    $186 million ($289 million before income taxes). These
    assets were producing at a combined net rate of approximately
    5,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the time of
    sale. In June 2006, the Corporation also completed the sale of
    certain U.S. Gulf Coast onshore oil and gas producing
    assets for $86 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of
    $50 million ($80 million before income taxes). These
    assets were producing at a combined net rate of approximately
    2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the time of
    sale. In 2005, the Corporation sold non-producing properties in
    the United Kingdom and exchanged a mature North Sea asset for an
    increased interest in the Pangkah development in Indonesia. In
    2004, the Corporation sold an office building in Scotland, a
    non-producing property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico
    properties.

The Corporation accrued $30 million in 2006 and
    $15 million in 2004 for vacated leased office space in the
    United Kingdom. These expenses are reflected principally in
    general and administrative expense in the income statement. The
    remaining accrual balance was $49 million at
    December 31, 2006 and $31 million at December 31,
    2005 after payments of $12 million in 2006 and
    $8 million in 2005.

During 2006, the United Kingdom increased the supplementary tax
    on petroleum operations from 10% to 20%. As a result, the
    Corporation recorded a $45 million adjustment to its United
    Kingdom deferred tax liability. The Exploration and Production
    income tax adjustments in 2005 reflect the effect on deferred
    income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark
    and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. In 2004, the foreign
    income tax benefits resulted from a tax law change and a tax
    settlement.

In 2005, the Corporation incurred incremental expenses,
    principally repair costs and higher insurance premiums, as a
    result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are
    included in production expenses in



HESS

the income statement. The legal settlement in 2005 resulted from
    the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset
    sale that is reflected in non-operating income in the income
    statement.

Marketing and Refining:

Earnings
    include income from the liquidation of prior year LIFO
    inventories in 2005 and 2004. In 2005, earnings included a
    charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the
    utility industry that is included in marketing expenses in the
    income statement.

Corporate:

In 2005, expenses include
    charges for premiums on bond repurchases, which are reflected in
    non-operating income (expense) in the income statement. In 2004,
    the Corporation recorded $20 million of insurance costs
    related to retrospective premium increases and a
    $13 million income tax benefit arising from the settlement
    of a federal tax audit.

Acquisitions

2006 Acquisitions:

In January 2006, the
    Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners,
    re-entered its former oil and gas production operations in the
    Waha concessions in Libya, in which the Corporation holds an
    8.16% interest. The re-entry terms included a

25-year

extension of the concessions and payments by the Corporation to
    the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $359 million. This
    transaction was accounted for as a business combination.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase
    price to assets and liabilities acquired (in millions):

Property, plant and equipment

The goodwill recorded in this transaction relates to the
    deferred tax liability recorded for the difference in book and
    tax bases of the assets acquired. The goodwill is not expected
    to be deductible for income tax purposes. The primary reason for
    the Libyan investment was to acquire long-lived crude oil
    reserves. The Corporation’s share of production from Libya
    averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2006.

The Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater
    section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the
    West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation
    has a

25-year

development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four
    existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
    opportunities. This transaction was accounted for as an
    acquisition of assets.

2005 Acquisitions:

The Corporation
    spent approximately $400 million during 2005 to acquire a
    controlling interest in a corporate joint venture, additional
    licenses and other assets in the Volga-Urals region of Russia.
    The primary reason for the Russian investments was to acquire
    long-lived crude oil reserves. Substantially all of the
    acquisition cost was allocated to unproved and proved properties.

    2004, the Corporation reduced LIFO inventories, which are
    carried at lower costs than current inventory costs. The effect
    of the LIFO inventory liquidations was to decrease cost of
    products sold by approximately $51 million in 2005 and
    $20 million in 2004.

Before Virgin Islands income
    taxes, which were recorded in the Corporation’s income tax
    provision.

The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of
    $400 million, $275 million and $88 million during
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Corporation’s share
    of HOVENSA’s undistributed income aggregated
    $302 million at December 31, 2006.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value
    of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
    PDVSA. The guarantee amounted to $229 million at
    December 31, 2006. This amount fluctuates based on the
    volume of crude oil purchased and the related crude oil prices.
    In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to
    a current maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does
    not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations.

At formation of the joint venture, PDVSA V.I., a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of PDVSA, purchased a 50% interest in the fixed
    assets of the Corporation’s Virgin Islands refinery for
    $62.5 million in cash and a

10-year

note
    from PDVSA V.I. for $562.5 million bearing interest at
    8.46% per annum and requiring principal payments over its
    term. The principal balance of the note was $137 million
    and $212 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, which is due to be fully repaid by February 2009.

The aggregate long-term debt maturing during the next five years

    current liabilities); 2008 – $28; 2009 –
    $143; 2010 – $30 and 2011 – $1,310.

At December 31, 2006, the Corporation’s fixed rate
    debentures have a principal amount of $2,816 million
    ($2,801 million net of unamortized discount). Interest
    rates on the outstanding fixed rate debentures have a weighted
    average rate of 7.3%.

During 2006, the Corporation amended and restated its existing
    syndicated revolving credit facility (the revolving credit
    facility) to increase the credit line to $3.0 billion from
    $2.5 billion and extend the term to May 2011 from December
    2009. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of
    credit. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has available
    capacity on the facility of $2.7 billion. Current
    borrowings under the facility bear interest at 0.525% above the
    London Interbank Offered Rate and a facility fee of 0.125% per
    annum is payable on the amount of the credit line. The interest
    rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the
    Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation has an asset-backed credit facility securitized
    by certain accounts receivable from its marketing operations,
    which are sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary. This asset-backed
    funding arrangement allows the Corporation to borrow up to
    $800 million subject to sufficient levels of eligible
    receivables. The credit line has a

364-day

maturity. Borrowings under the asset-backed credit facility
    represent floating rate debt for which the weighted average
    interest rate was 5.5% for 2006. Outstanding borrowings of
    $318 million at December 31, 2006 are classified as
    long term based on the Corporation’s available capacity
    under the committed revolving credit facility. At
    December 31, 2006, total collateralized accounts receivable
    of approximately $1,100 million are serviced by the
    Corporation and recorded on its balance sheet but are not
    available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation
    before repayment of outstanding borrowings under the
    asset-backed facility.



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a
    financial covenant that restricts the amount of total
    borrowings, secured debt and cash dividends. At
    December 31, 2006, the Corporation is permitted to borrow
    up to an additional $9.7 billion for the construction or
    acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow
    up to an additional $2.2 billion of secured debt at
    December 31, 2006. At year-end, the amount that can be
    borrowed for the payment of dividends or stock repurchases is
    $3.7 billion.

The total amount of interest paid (net of amounts capitalized),
    principally on short-term and long-term debt, was
    $200 million, $245 million and $243 million in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Corporation capitalized
    interest of $100 million, $80 million and
    $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

9.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Corporation awards restricted common stock and stock options
    under its Amended and Restated 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
    Generally, stock options vest from one to three years from the
    date of grant, have a

10-year

option life, and the exercise price equals or exceeds the market
    price on the date of grant. Outstanding restricted common stock
    generally vests three to five years from the date of grant.

Share-based compensation expense was $68 million
    ($42 million after income taxes) for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, of which $30 million
    ($19 million after income taxes) related to stock options
    and the remainder related to restricted stock. Stock option
    expense recorded in the year 2006 reduced basic and diluted
    earnings per share by $.07 and $.06, respectively. Total pre-tax
    compensation expense for restricted common stock was
    $28 million in 2005 and $17 million in 2004.

The following pro forma financial information presents the
    effect on net income and earnings per share as if the

The intrinsic value (or the amount by which the market price of
    the Corporation’s Common Stock exceeds the exercise price
    of an option) for outstanding options and exercisable options at
    December 31, 2006 was $257 million and
    $188 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006,
    assuming forfeitures of 2% per year, the number of
    outstanding options that are expected to vest is
    12,736,000 shares with a weighted average exercise price of
    $29.53 per share. At December 31, 2006 the weighted average
    remaining term of exercisable options was 5 years and the
    remaining term of all outstanding options was 7 years.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
    fair value of employee stock options. The following weighted
    average assumptions were utilized for stock options awarded:

The assumption above for the risk free interest rate is based on
    the expected terms of the options and is obtained from published
    sources. The stock price volatility is determined from
    historical experience using the same period as the expected
    terms of the options. The expected stock option term is based on
    historical exercise patterns and the expected future holding
    period.

At December 31, 2006, the number of common shares reserved

Foreign

Foreign currency gains (losses) before income taxes amounted to

    $29 million in 2004. The balances in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency
    translation were reductions in stockholders’ equity of
    $61 million at December 31, 2006 and $92 million
    at December 31, 2005.

11.

Retirement
    Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plans for a significant portion of its employees. In
    addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
    plan covering certain employees. The unfunded supplemental
    pension plan provides for incremental pension payments from the
    Corporation’s funds so that total pension payments equal
    amounts that would have been payable from the Corporation’s
    principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by
    income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based
    on years of service and final average salary. Additionally, the
    Corporation maintains a postretirement medical plan that
    provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from
    ages 55 through 65. The Corporation uses December 31
    as the measurement date for all of these retirement plans.

Effective December 31, 2006, the Corporation prospectively
    adopted FAS No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting For
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(FAS No. 158), which requires recognition on the
    balance sheet of the underfunded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan measured as the difference between



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The
    benefit obligation is defined as the projected benefit
    obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement
    obligation for postretirement medical plans. The Corporation
    recognizes on the balance sheet all changes in the funded status
    of its defined benefit postretirement plans in the year in which
    such changes occur. As a result of adopting FAS 158, the
    Corporation recorded an after-tax decrease in stockholders’
    equity of $142 million ($225 million before-tax) by
    increasing accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The

    expense is estimated to be approximately $70 million, of
    which $25 million relates to the amortization of estimated
    actuarial losses.

The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for
    each year were established at the end of each previous year
    while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were
    established at each year-end. The net periodic benefit cost and
    the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on
    actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The
    discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high-quality,
    fixed-income debt instruments with maturities that approximate
    the payment of plan obligations. The overall expected return on
    plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for
    each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of
    pension assets to that asset category. The Corporation engages
    an independent investment consultant to assist in the
    development of these expected returns.

The Corporation’s investment strategy is to maximize
    returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad
    diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes.
    Asset classes and target allocations are determined by the
    Company’s investment committee and include domestic and
    foreign equities, fixed income securities, and other
    investments, including hedge funds and private equity.
    Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities
    issued by the Corporation unless indirectly held as part of an
    index strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid,
    providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements.

The Corporation has budgeted contributions of approximately

    Corporation also has budgeted contributions of approximately
    $15 million to the trust established for the unfunded plan.

Estimated future benefit payments for the funded and unfunded

The Corporation also contributes to several defined contribution
    plans for eligible employees. Employees may contribute a portion
    of their compensation to the plans and the Corporation matches a
    portion of the employee contributions. The Corporation recorded
    expense of $16 million in 2006, $14 million in 2005

The increase in the 2006 effective income tax rate was primarily
    due to taxes on Libyan operations and the increase in the
    supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom
    from 10% to 20%. During 2006, the Algerian government amended
    its hydrocarbon tax laws effective August 1, 2006 and the
    Corporation recorded a net charge of $6 million for the
    estimated impact of the tax.

The American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) provided for a one-time
    reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of
    eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a
    U.S. parent. During 2005, the Corporation repatriated
    $1.9 billion of foreign dividends under the Act and
    recorded a related income tax provision of approximately
    $72 million.

The Corporation has not recorded deferred income taxes
    applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations. The Corporation had undistributed earnings from
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $5.4 billion at
    December 31, 2006. If the earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    were not indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
    approximately $1.9 billion would be required, excluding the
    potential use of foreign tax credits in the United States.

At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has net operating
    loss carryforwards in the United States of approximately
    $3.2 billion, substantially all of which expire in 2022
    through 2025. In addition, a foreign Exploration and Production
    subsidiary has a net operating loss carryforward of
    approximately $500 million, which can be carried forward
    indefinitely. For income tax reporting at December 31,
    2006, the Corporation has alternative minimum tax credit
    carryforwards of approximately $135 million, which can be
    carried forward indefinitely. The Corporation also has
    approximately $45 million of general business credits,
    substantially all of which expire between 2011 and 2025.

Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2006, 2005 and 2004
    amounted to $1,799 million, $1,139 million and
    $632 million, respectively.

On May 3, 2006, the Corporation’s shareholders voted
    to increase the number of authorized common shares from
    200 million to 600 million and the board of directors
    declared a

three-for-one

stock split. The stock split was completed in the form of a
    stock dividend that was issued on May 31, 2006 to
    shareholders of record on May 17, 2006. The common share
    par value remained at $1.00 per share. All common share and
    per share amounts in these financial statements and notes are on
    an after-split basis for all periods presented.

On December 1, 2006, all of the Corporation’s
    13,500,000 outstanding shares of 7% cumulative mandatory
    convertible preferred shares were converted into common stock.
    Based on the Corporation’s average closing common stock
    price over the

20-day

period before conversion, the conversion rate was
    2.4915 shares of common stock for each share of preferred.
    The Corporation issued 33,635,191 shares of common stock
    for the conversion of its 7% cumulative mandatory convertible
    preferred shares. Fractional shares were settled by cash
    payments.

At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has outstanding
    323,715 shares of 3% cumulative convertible preferred stock
    which have a total liquidation value of $16 million
    ($50 per share). Each share of the 3% cumulative
    convertible preferred stock is convertible at the option of the

Financial
    Instruments, Non-trading and Trading Activities

Non-Trading:

The Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Hedging activities decreased Exploration and Production revenues
    by $449 million in 2006, $1,582 million in 2005 and
    $935 million in 2004. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness
    losses reflected in revenue in 2006 and 2005 was $5 million
    and $17 million, respectively, and was not material during
    the year ended December 31, 2004.



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

The Corporation’s crude oil hedging activities included the
    use of commodity futures and swap contracts. At

The Corporation had no WTI crude oil or natural gas hedges at
    year-end 2006. The Corporation also markets energy commodities
    including refined petroleum products, natural gas and
    electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to manage
    the underlying risk in its marketing activities. At
    December 31, 2006, net after tax deferred losses in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from the
    Corporation’s hedging contracts were $1,338 million
    ($2,101 million before income taxes). At December 31,
    2005, net after-tax deferred losses were $1,304 million
    ($2,063 million before income taxes). The pre-tax amount of
    all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and
    the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax
    assets on the balance sheet.

Commodity Trading:

The Corporation,
    principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy
    commodities and securities and derivatives including futures,
    forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future
    market conditions. The Corporation’s income before income
    taxes from trading activities, including its share of the
    earnings of the trading partnership amounted to $83 million
    in 2006, $60 million in 2005 and $72 million in 2004.

Other Financial Instruments:

The
    Corporation has $729 million of notional value foreign
    currency forward contracts maturing through 2007,
    ($677 million at December 31, 2005). Notional amounts
    do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the
    Corporation, but are used in the calculation of cash settlements
    under the contracts. The fair value of the foreign currency
    forward contracts recorded by the Corporation was a receivable
    of $51 million at December 31, 2006 and a liability of
    $31 million at December 31, 2005.

The Corporation has $3,479 million in letters of credit
    outstanding at December 31, 2006 ($2,685 million at
    December 31, 2005). Of the total letters of credit
    outstanding at December 31, 2006, $52 million relates
    to contingent liabilities and the remaining $3,427 million
    relates to liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.

Fair Value Disclosure:

The Corporation
    estimates the fair value of its fixed-rate notes receivable and
    debt generally using discounted cash flow analysis based on
    current interest rates for instruments with similar maturities
    and risk profiles. Foreign currency exchange contracts are
    valued based on current termination values or quoted market
    prices of comparable contracts. The Corporation’s valuation
    of commodity contracts considers quoted market prices where
    applicable. In the absence of quoted market prices, the
    Corporation values contracts at fair value considering time
    value, volatility of the underlying commodities and other
    factors.



HESS

The carrying amounts of the Corporation’s financial

    Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, generally
    approximate their fair values at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, except fixed rate long-term debt which had a carrying
    value of $3,149 million and a fair value of
    $3,482 million at December 31, 2006 and a carrying
    value of $3,174 million and a fair value of
    $3,675 million at December 31, 2005.

Credit Risks:

The Corporation’s
    financial instruments expose it to credit risks and may at times
    be concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
    counterparties. Trade receivables in the Exploration and
    Production and Marketing and Refining businesses are generated
    from a diverse domestic and international customer base. The
    Corporation continuously monitors counterparty concentration and
    credit risk. The Corporation reduces its risk related to certain
    counterparties by using master netting agreements and requiring
    collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.

16.

Guarantees
    and Contingencies

The Corporation’s guarantees include $15 million of
    HOVENSA’s senior debt obligations and $229 million of
    HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases, see note 5, “Refining
    Joint Venture.” The remainder relates to a loan guarantee
    of $57 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation
    owns a 2.36% interest. In addition, the Corporation has
    $52 million in letters of credit for which it is
    contingently liable. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments that the Corporation could be required to make under
    its guarantees at December 31, 2006 is $353 million
    ($306 million at December 31, 2005). The Corporation
    has a contingent purchase obligation expiring in April 2010, to
    acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline
    station joint venture, for approximately $140 million as of
    December 31, 2006.

The Corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to
    various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
    environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the
    Corporation’s consolidated financial statements when it is
    probable, a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the
    amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is
    only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however,
    the Corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies in
    accordance with FAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies.

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, is a party to numerous
    lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl
    ether (MTBE) in gasoline. These cases have been consolidated in
    the Southern District of New York. The principal allegation in
    all cases is that gasoline



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties
    are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline
    market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to
    take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the
    environment of releases of MTBE. In some cases, punitive damages
    are also sought. In April 2005, the District Court denied
    the primary legal aspects of the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss these actions. While the damages claimed in these
    actions are substantial, and it is reasonably possible that a
    liability may have been incurred, only limited information is
    available to evaluate the factual and legal merits of these
    claims. The Corporation also believes that significant legal
    uncertainty remains regarding the validity of causes of action
    asserted and availability of the relief sought by plaintiffs.
    Accordingly, based on the information currently available, there
    is insufficient information on which to evaluate the
    Corporation’s exposure in these cases.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve assertions by the Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) that refining facilities were modified
    or expanded without complying with New Source Review regulations
    that require permits and new emission controls in certain
    circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions
    control requirements. These consent agreements, which arise out
    of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners
    and utilities, have typically imposed substantial civil fines
    and penalties and required significant capital expenditures to
    install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year
    time period. The penalties assessed and the capital expenditures
    required vary considerably between refineries. The EPA initially
    contacted the Corporation and HOVENSA regarding the petroleum
    refinery initiative in August 2003 and the Corporation and
    HOVENSA expect to have further discussions with EPA regarding
    the initiative. While it is reasonably possible additional
    capital expenditures and operating expenses may be incurred in
    the future, the amounts cannot be estimated at this time. The
    amount of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material to
    the financial position or results of operations of the
    Corporation.

The Corporation is also currently subject to certain other
    existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings, which it considers
    routine and incidental to its business. The Corporation believes
    that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related
    to any of these other known contingent liability exposures would
    have a material adverse impact on its financial position or
    results of operations.

17.

Segment
    Information

The Corporation has two operating segments that comprise the
    structure used by senior management to make key operating
    decisions and assess performance. These are (1) Exploration
    and Production and (2) Marketing and Refining. Exploration
    and Production operations include the exploration for and the
    development, production, purchase, transportation and sale of
    crude oil and natural gas. Marketing and Refining operations
    include the manufacture, purchase, transportation, trading and
    marketing of refined petroleum products, natural gas and
    electricity.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
    accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
    requirements of the FASB. For reserves to be booked as proved
    they must be commercially producible; government approvals must
    be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost,
    senior management or the board of directors, must commit to fund
    the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve
    estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent
    third party reserve determination as well as internal technical
    appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own
    internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical
    staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The
    Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates
    throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells,
    performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To
    provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve
    estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and
    approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are
    subject to internal technical audits and senior management
    reviews the estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported on the following page
    are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer
    and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal
    estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with
    engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production
    histories and other information necessary for the reserve
    determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s
    technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information
    provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review
    the final reserve estimates issued by D&M.

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying year-end oil
    and gas selling prices (adjusted for price changes provided by
    contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of
    proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development
    and production costs, which are based on year-end costs and
    existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are
    computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax
    rates to the pre-tax net



cash flows relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas
    reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed
    rate of 10%. The discounted future net cash flow estimates
    required by FAS No. 69 do not include exploration
    expenses, interest expense or corporate general and
    administrative expenses. The selling prices of crude oil and
    natural gas are highly volatile. The year-end prices, which are
    required to be used for the discounted future net cash flows and
    do not include the effects of hedges, may not be representative
    of future selling prices. The future net cash flow estimates
    could be materially different if other assumptions were used.
