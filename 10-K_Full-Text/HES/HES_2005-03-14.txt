PART I

Items 1 and 2.

Business and Properties

Amerada Hess Corporation (the Registrant) is a Delaware
corporation, incorporated in 1920. The Registrant and its
subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the
“Corporation”) explore for, produce, purchase,
transport and sell crude oil and natural gas. These exploration
and production activities take place in the United States,
United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria,
Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Malaysia and other
countries. The Corporation also manufactures, purchases, trades
and markets refined petroleum and other energy products. The
Corporation owns 50% of a refinery joint venture in the United
States Virgin Islands, and another refining facility, terminals
and retail gasoline stations located on the East Coast of the
United States.

Exploration and Production

At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had 646 million
barrels of proved crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves,
the same as at the end of 2003. Proved natural gas reserves were
2,400 million Mcf at December 31, 2004 compared with
2,332 million Mcf at December 31, 2003. Proved
reserves at December 31, 2004 include 37% and 52%,
respectively, of crude oil and natural gas reserves held under
production sharing contracts. Of the total proved reserves (on a
barrel of oil equivalent basis), 17% are located in the United
States, 39% are located in the United Kingdom, Norwegian and
Danish sectors of the North Sea, 17% are located in Africa and
the remainder are located in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and
Azerbaijan. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, 38% of the
Corporation’s December 31, 2004 worldwide proved
reserves are undeveloped (32% in 2003). Most of the proved
undeveloped reserves relate to properties being developed in
Africa and Asia.

Worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids production amounted
to 246,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared with
259,000 barrels per day in 2003. Worldwide natural gas
production was 575,000 Mcf per day in 2004 compared with
683,000 Mcf per day in 2003. On a barrel of oil equivalent
basis, production from continuing operations was
342,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared with
360,000 barrels per day in 2003. The Corporation presently
estimates that its 2005 barrel of oil equivalent production
will be approximately 350,000 barrels per day. The
Corporation is developing a number of oil and gas fields and has
an inventory of domestic and foreign exploration prospects.

Worldwide crude oil and natural gas production was as follows:



*

Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of
    relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).

**

Includes production from properties classified as
    discontinued operations of 13 thousand barrels of oil equivalent
    per day.

United States.

Amerada Hess Corporation operates
mainly offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Texas,
Louisiana and North Dakota. During 2004, 23% of the
Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
and 30% of its natural gas production were from United States
operations.

The table below sets forth the Corporation’s average daily
net production by area in the United States:

The Llano Field on Garden Banks Blocks 385 and 386 in the
Gulf of Mexico commenced production in April and the
Corporation’s 50% interest is currently averaging
approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Additional appraisal drilling is planned for the Shenzi prospect
(AHC 28%) on Green Canyon



Block 654 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Further
appraisal drilling is also planned for the Tubular Bells
discovery (AHC 20%) on Mississippi Canyon Block 725 in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has interests in
approximately 376 exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico of
which it operates 260. The Corporation has 1,341,000 net
undeveloped acres in the Gulf of Mexico.

United Kingdom.

The Corporation’s activities
in the United Kingdom are conducted by its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Amerada Hess Limited. During 2004, 30% of the
Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
and 47% of its natural gas production were from United Kingdom
operations.

The table below sets forth the Corporation’s average daily
net production in the United Kingdom by field and the
Corporation’s interest in each at December 31, 2004:

Production from the Clair Field (AHC 9.29%) commenced in early
2005. The Atlantic (AHC 25%) and Cromarty (AHC 90%) natural gas
fields are also being developed. These fields are expected to
produce at an annualized rate of approximately
25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day when they are
onstream in 2006.

During 2003, the Corporation exchanged 14% interests in the
Scott and Telford fields for an additional 22.5% interest in the
Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Amerada Hess
Limited exchanged its 25% shareholding interest in Premier Oil
plc, for a 23% interest in Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia.

Norway.

The Corporation’s activities in
Norway are conducted through its wholly-owned Norwegian
subsidiary, Amerada Hess Norge A/ S. Norwegian operations
accounted for crude oil and natural gas liquids production of
28,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 25,000 barrels per day
in 2003. Natural gas production averaged 27,000 Mcf per day
in 2004 and 26,000 Mcf per day in 2003. Substantially all
of the Norwegian



production is from the Corporation’s 28.09% interest in the
Valhall Field. Drilling for the enhanced-recovery waterflood
project in the Valhall Field is scheduled to commence in 2005.

Denmark.

Amerada Hess ApS, the Corporation’s
wholly-owned Danish subsidiary, operates the South Arne Field.
Net crude oil production from the Corporation’s 57.48%
interest in the South Arne Field was 22,000 barrels of
crude oil per day in 2004 and 24,000 barrels of crude oil
per day in 2003. Natural gas production was 24,000 Mcf and
29,000 Mcf per day in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Equatorial Guinea.

The Corporation has interests
in production sharing contracts covering three offshore blocks.
Net crude oil production from the Corporation’s 85%
interest in the Ceiba Field averaged 26,000 barrels of
crude oil per day in 2004 and 22,000 barrels per day in
2003. The development plan for the Okume Complex, formerly
referred to as Northern Block G, received government approval
during 2004. Most of the major contracts for construction have
been authorized and development drilling will begin in 2006.
First production from the Okume Complex is expected in early
2007.

Malaysia — Thailand.

In 2003, the
Corporation exchanged its oil and gas assets in Colombia for an
additional 25% interest in long-lived natural gas reserves in
the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA),
bringing the Corporation’s interest to 50%. In 2004, the
Corporation negotiated additional gas sales covering Block A-18
in the JDA, which will result in production growth in the
future. First production from the field under the original gas
sales agreement commenced in early 2005.

Algeria.

The Corporation has a 49% interest in a
venture with the Algerian national oil company that is
redeveloping three oil fields. The Corporation’s share of
production averaged 23,000 and 19,000 barrels of crude oil
per day in 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the second
phase of the project to redevelop these fields was approved,
resulting in an increased investment commitment of approximately
$400 million.

Gabon.

Amerada Hess Production Gabon, the
Corporation’s 77.5% owned Gabonese subsidiary, has a 10%
interest in the Rabi Kounga Field and interests in two other
Gabonese fields. The Corporation’s share of production
averaged 12,000 net barrels of crude oil per day in 2004
and 11,000 barrels per day in 2003.

Indonesia.

During 2003, the Corporation acquired a
23% interest in the Natuna Sea Block A production sharing
contract in exchange for its shares of Premier Oil plc. Natural
gas production in Indonesia increased to 32,000 Mcf per day
in 2004 from 11,000 Mcf per day in 2003. In December 2004,
the Ujung Pangkah gas sales agreement was approved and gas sales
are expected to commence by early 2007.

Thailand.

The Corporation has a 15% interest in
the Pailin gas field offshore Thailand. Net production from the
Corporation’s interest averaged 53,000 Mcf and
52,000 Mcf of natural gas per day in 2004 and 2003,
respectively. An onshore discovery on Phu Horm Block E5N (AHC
35%) has been successfully appraised and is now in the
permitting process. It is expected that this project will be
approved in 2005 with first production in 2007.

Azerbaijan.

The Corporation has a 2.72% interest
in the AIOC Consortium in the Caspian Sea. Net production from
its interest averaged 2,000 barrels of crude oil per day in
2004 and 2003. Phase three of the development of the Azeri,
Chirag and Guneshli Fields was approved in 2004 and will result
in increased production in the future. The Corporation also
holds a 2.36% interest in the BTC Pipeline.

Refining and Marketing

Refining.

The Corporation owns a 50% interest in
the HOVENSA refining joint venture in the United States Virgin
Islands with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
(PDVSA). In addition, it owns and operates a refining facility
in Port Reading, New Jersey.

HOVENSA.

HOVENSA’s total crude runs amounted
to 484,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 440,000 barrels
per day in 2003. The fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA
operated at the rates of 139,000 and 142,000 barrels per
day in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA
operated at the rate of 55,000 barrels per day in 2004 and
53,000 barrels per day in 2003. The coker permits HOVENSA
to run lower-cost heavy crude oil. HOVENSA has a long-term
supply contract with PDVSA to purchase 115,000 barrels
per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy crude oil. PDVSA also supplies
155,000 barrels



per day of Venezuelan Mesa medium gravity crude oil to HOVENSA
under a long-term crude oil supply contract. The remaining crude
oil requirements are purchased mainly under contracts of one
year or less from third parties and through spot purchases on
the open market. After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to
third parties, the Corporation purchases 50% of
HOVENSA’s remaining production at market prices.

Port Reading Facility.

The Corporation owns and
operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading,
New Jersey. This facility processes vacuum gas oil and residual
fuel oil and operated at a rate of approximately
52,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 54,000 barrels per
day in 2003. Substantially all of Port Reading’s production
is gasoline and heating oil.

Marketing.

The Corporation markets refined
petroleum products on the East Coast of the United States to the
motoring public, wholesale distributors, industrial and
commercial users, other petroleum companies, governmental
agencies and public utilities. It also markets natural gas to
utilities and other industrial and commercial customers. The
Corporation’s energy marketing activities include the sale
of electricity. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a
consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and
derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
its own account.

The Corporation has 1,254 HESS® gasoline stations at
December 31, 2004, of which approximately 67% are company
operated. The Corporation has 941 convenience stores at its
gasoline stations. In early 2004, a 50% owned joint venture
acquired a chain of gasoline stations, adding approximately 50
HESS® retail outlets. Most of the Corporation’s
gasoline stations are in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Florida, Massachusetts and North and South Carolina. The
Corporation owns approximately 50% of the properties on which
the stations are located.

The Corporation has 22 terminals with an aggregate storage
capacity of 21 million barrels in its East Coast marketing
areas.

Refined product sales averaged 428,000 barrels per day in
2004 and 419,000 barrels per day in 2003. Of total refined
products sold in 2004, approximately 54% was obtained from
HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation purchased the balance
from others under short-term supply contracts and by spot
purchases from various sources.

In June 2004, the Corporation formed a 50% owned joint venture,
Hess LNG, which will pursue investments in liquefied natural gas
(LNG) terminals and related supply, trading and marketing
opportunities. The joint venture is pursuing development of an
LNG terminal project located in Fall River, Massachusetts.

The Corporation has a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides
distributed electricity generating equipment to industrial and
commercial customers as an alternative to purchasing electricity
from local utilities. The Corporation also has invested in
long-term technology to develop fuel cells for electricity
generation through a venture with other parties.

Competition and Market Conditions

The petroleum industry is highly competitive. The Corporation
encounters competition from numerous companies in each of its
activities, particularly in acquiring rights to explore for
crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of
refined products and natural gas. Many competitors are larger
and have substantially greater resources than the Corporation.
The Corporation is also in competition with producers and
marketers of other forms of energy.

The petroleum business involves large-scale capital expenditures
and risk-taking. In the search for new oil and gas reserves,
long lead times are often required from successful exploration
to subsequent production. Operations in the petroleum industry
are dependent upon a depleting natural resource. The number of
areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons will be
discovered in commercial quantities is constantly diminishing
and exploration risks are high. Areas where hydrocarbons may be
found are often in remote locations or offshore where
exploration and development activities are capital intensive and
operating costs are high.



The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert
considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil
and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to
agree on a common policy on rates of production and other
matters has a significant impact on oil markets and the
Corporation. The derivatives markets are also important in
influencing the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and
refined products. The Corporation cannot predict the extent to
which future market conditions may be affected by foreign oil
producing countries, the derivatives markets or other external
influences.

Other Items

Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and
regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax
claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract
rights, and changes in import regulations, as well as other
political developments may affect the Corporation’s
operations. The Corporation has been affected by certain of
these events in various countries in which it operates. The
Corporation markets motor fuels through lessee-dealers and
wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits
producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in
retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been
periodically proposed in the U.S. Congress and in various
other states. The Corporation, at this time, cannot predict the
effect of any of the foregoing on its future operations.

Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution
control regulations imposed by federal, state and local
governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Corporation’s earnings and competitive position within
the industry. The Corporation spent $12 million in 2004 for
environmental remediation, with a comparable amount anticipated
for 2005. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to
comply with federal, state and local environmental standards,
were $1 million in 2004 and the Corporation anticipates
approximately $35 million in 2005. Regulatory changes
already made or anticipated in the United States will alter the
composition and emissions characteristics of motor fuels. Future
capital expenditures necessary to comply with these regulations
will be substantial. The Environmental Protection Agency has
adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline and
diesel fuel. Capital expenditures necessary to comply with the
low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading are estimated
to be approximately $70 million over the next two years.
Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and
diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are currently expected to be
approximately $400 million over the next two years,
$50 million of which has already been spent. HOVENSA
expects to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow
and, if necessary, future borrowings.

The number of persons employed by the Corporation averaged
11,119 in 2004 and 11,481 in 2003.

The Corporation’s Internet address is www.hess.com. On its
website, the Corporation makes available free of charge its
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments
to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Corporation electronically
files with or furnishes such material to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Copies of the Corporation’s Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics, its Corporate Governance Guidelines
and the charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and
Management Development Committee and the Corporate Governance
and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors are available
on the Corporation’s website and are also available free of
charge upon request to the Secretary of the Corporation at its
principal executive offices. The Corporation has also filed with
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) its annual certification that
the Corporation’s chief executive officer is unaware of any
violation of the NYSE’s corporate governance standards.

Oil and Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas reserves at the
end of 2004, 2003 and 2002 are presented under Supplementary Oil
and Gas Data in the accompanying financial statements.

During 2004, the Corporation provided oil and gas reserve
estimates for 2003 to the Department of Energy. Such estimates
are compatible with the information furnished to the SEC on
Form 10-K, although



not necessarily directly comparable due to the requirements of
the individual requests. There were no differences in excess of
5%.

The Corporation has no contracts or agreements to sell fixed
quantities of its crude oil production, although derivative
instruments are used to reduce the effects of changes in selling
prices. In the United States, natural gas is sold to local
distribution companies, and commercial, industrial and other
purchasers, on a spot basis and under contracts for varying
periods. The Corporation’s United States production is
expected to approximate 55% of its 2005 sales commitments under
long-term contracts that total approximately 275,000 Mcf
per day. Natural gas sales commitments for 2006 are expected to
be comparable. The Corporation attempts to minimize price and
supply risks associated with its United States natural gas
supply commitments by entering into purchase contracts with
third parties having adequate sources of supply, on terms
substantially similar to those under its commitments.

Average selling prices and average production costs

Note A: Includes inter-company transfers valued at
approximate market prices and the effect of the
Corporation’s hedging activities.

Note B: Production (lifting) costs consist of
amounts incurred to operate and maintain the Corporation’s
producing oil and gas wells, related equipment and facilities
(including lease costs of floating production and storage
facilities) and production and severance taxes. The average
production costs per barrel of oil equivalent reflect the crude
oil equivalent of natural gas production converted based on the
basis of relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).

The foregoing tabulation does not include substantial costs and
charges applicable to finding and developing proved oil and gas
reserves, nor does it reflect the costs of related general and
administrative expenses, interest expense and income taxes.

Legal Proceedings

Purported class actions consolidated under the complaint
captioned

In re Amerada Hess Corporation Securities
Litigation

are pending in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey, against certain executive
officers and former executive officers of the Registrant
alleging that these individuals sold shares of Registrant’s
common stock in advance of Registrant’s acquisition of
Triton Energy Limited (Triton) in 2001 in violation of federal
securities laws. In April 2003, the Registrant and the other
defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim and failure to plead fraud with particularity. On
March 31, 2004, the court granted the defendants’
motion to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs were granted
leave to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint in June 2004. In August 2004, defendant moved to
dismiss the plaintiffs amended complaint. This motion is
currently pending with the District Court. Two other purported
class actions, based in large part on the same factual
background, were commenced in May and August 2003 and were
consolidated under a complaint captioned

Falk et. al. v.
Amerada Hess Corporation, et. al.

in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey against certain
named executive officers, certain directors and former directors
and certain employees of Registrant on behalf of participants in
the



Registrant’s savings and stock bonus plans, alleging that
the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, resulting in losses to
participants in the plan who held shares of the
Registrant’s common stock. Registrant and the other
defendants moved to dismiss these actions in December 2003. This
motion was denied by the District Court in May 2004. Registrant
has reached a tentative settlement of these actions, subject to
approval of the District Court. The Registrant is advancing
expenses to these individuals in accordance with its By-Laws to
defend these actions. Based on current legal and factual
circumstances, Registrant does not believe these actions will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

Registrant has been served with a complaint from the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) relating to
alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in Brooklyn, New
York. The complaint, which seeks an order to shut down the
terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts, alleges
violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks,
the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads, petroleum discharges
and improper certification of tank repairs. DEC is also seeking
relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in
the New York metropolitan area. Registrant believes that many of
the allegations are factually inaccurate or based on an
incorrect interpretation of applicable law. Registrant has
already addressed the primary conditions discussed in the
complaint. Registrant intends to vigorously contest the
complaint, but is involved in settlement discussions with DEC.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
consent agreements to resolve EPA’s assertions that
refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying
with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new
emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations
that impose emissions control requirements. These consent
agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative
focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically
imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required
significant capital expenditures to install emissions control
equipment. EPA contacted Registrant and HOVENSA L.L.C.
(HOVENSA), its 50% owned joint venture with Petroleos de
Venezuela, regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in August
2003 and held an initial meeting in October 2003. While EPA has
not made any specific assertions that the Registrant or HOVENSA
violated the New Source Review regulations, the Registrant and
HOVENSA expect to have further discussions with EPA regarding
the petroleum refining initiative.

In June 2001, the Corporation voluntarily investigated and
disclosed to the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (NJDEP) that there was a calculation error
in the program code of the Port Reading refining facility’s
Wet Gas Scrubber (WGS) Continuous Emissions Monitoring
System (CEM). The error in the code resulted in the CEM system
under calculating CO, NOx and SO


emissions from the
WGS beginning in late 1998 and some exceedances of the permit
limits for NOx. After discovery, the code error was promptly
corrected. In November 2003, the Corporation received a notice
of violation from the NJDEP relating to the CEM coding error
that proposes a fine of $649,600, subsequently revised to
$319,600. The Corporation is engaging in settlement discussions
with NJDEP to resolve this matter, particularly as regards to a
reduction in the revised penalty to reflect the voluntary
self-disclosure of the issue.

The Registrant, along with other companies engaged in refining
and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and
claims related to the use of the methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE) in gasoline. A series of substantially identical
lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental
entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States
against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produce
gasoline containing MTBE, including Registrant. These cases have
been consolidated in the Southern District of New York. The
principal allegation is that gasoline containing MTBE is a
defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in
proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to
groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action
to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases
of MTBE. Additional property damage and personal injury lawsuits
and claims related to the use of MTBE are expected. Prior class
action product liability based litigation involving MTBE in
gasoline has been resolved without a material effect on the
Registrant. While the damages claimed in these actions are
substantial, Registrant has no reason to believe, based on
factual and legal circumstances currently known to the
Registrant, that these actions will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition. However, these actions are in
their preliminary stages, and the factual and legal
circumstances may change.



In April 2003, HOVENSA received a notice of violation from the
Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources
(DPNR), relating to certain alleged wastewater permit
exceedances occurring in 2001 and 2002 at HOVENSA. The notice
proposes a fine of $219,000 and requires corrective actions to
address the alleged violations. HOVENSA is engaging in
settlement discussions with DPNR to resolve this matter.

The Registrant periodically receives notices from EPA that it is
a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation
relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With
respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s claims have been
settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all
cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of
these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private
parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot
be predicted at this time due to the large number of other
potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of
clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

Registrant is one of approximately 40 companies that have
received a directive from the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection to remediate contamination in the
sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking
natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects
Registrant, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk
storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by Registrant.
EPA has also issued an order relating to the same contamination.
The costs of remediation of the Passaic River are preliminary,
but NJDEP has estimated them at approximately $900 million.
Based on currently known facts and circumstances, Registrant
does not believe that this matter will result in material
liability because its terminal could not have contributed
contamination along most of the river’s length and did not
store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in
the river sediments, and because there are numerous other
parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and
damages.

On or about July 15, 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp.
(HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant, and HOVENSA
L.L.C., in which Registrant owns a 50% interest, each received a
letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of
Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees,
advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit against
HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous
substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south
shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had been
operated by HOVIC until October 1998. The letter does not
specify the basis for the claim or a claimed damages amount. If
an action is brought, Registrant and HOVENSA intend to
vigorously defend it.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of
them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such
proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In management’s
opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances,
such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

A five-year summary of selected financial data follows:



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
operates in two segments, exploration and production (E&P)
and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P segment
explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The
R&M segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets
refined petroleum and other energy products.

The Corporation’s goal for the E&P segment is to grow
reserves and production profitably with its portfolio of
development projects and to deliver exploration success. During
2002 and 2003, the Corporation reshaped its E&P asset
portfolio by:

•

Selling higher cost properties predominantly in the shallow
    water Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea for proceeds of
    $738 million.

•

Exchanging interests in mature producing assets for increased
    interests in development stage assets in the joint development
    area of Malaysia and Thailand and deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

•

Participating in two oil discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico.

The asset sales and exchanges contributed significantly to the
decline in production from 451,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day in 2002 to 342,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day in 2004. In 2005, the Corporation forecasts
that crude oil and natural gas production will
average 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

In 2004, the Corporation continued to make progress in its
development projects that are expected to provide significant
new production in 2006 and 2007, which will more than offset
natural declines in existing fields. Milestones accomplished on
our development projects in 2004 were:

During 2004, the Corporation drilled successful appraisal wells
at the Shenzi prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, at the
Phu Horm Field onshore Thailand, and at Ujung Pangkah. In
December, the Corporation announced a natural gas discovery at
the Belud prospect offshore Malaysia. The Corporation has an
inventory of exploration prospects and will drill several high
impact wells in 2005.

The Corporation has two exploration wells currently drilling in
the Gulf of Mexico that will have estimated pre-tax capitalized
drilling costs of approximately $100 to $110 million
upon completion. If either or both of these wells are
unsuccessful, after-tax first quarter 2005 earnings would be
reduced by up to $70 million.



Proved reserves increased to 1.046 billion barrels of oil
equivalent at year-end 2004 from 1.035 billion barrels of
oil equivalent at the end of 2003. The Corporation’s
reserves included in this Form 10-K are calculated by an
independent third party reserve engineer. See further discussion
of management’s governance over the estimation of oil and
gas reserves in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on page 73.

The strategic goals for R&M are to maximize returns from
existing assets and generate free cash flow. The Corporation may
grow the retail and energy marketing businesses
opportunistically. During 2004 and 2003, the R&M
segment’s results improved significantly, primarily due to
higher refining margins. The HOVENSA and Port Reading refineries
operated near maximum capacity for most of the year, enabling
them to take full advantage of the strong margins.
HOVENSA’s capacity to process lower cost heavy crude oil
enhanced profitability in 2004, due to a significant price
differential between light and heavy crude oil. In 2004, the
Corporation received a cash distribution of $88 million
from HOVENSA. The HOVENSA fluid catalytic cracking unit was
shutdown for approximately 30 days of planned maintenance
in the first quarter of 2005. Planned maintenance of the fluid
catalytic cracking unit at the Port Reading facility is underway
and expected to last for approximately 30 days.

The Corporation’s liquidity and financial position have
improved significantly since year-end 2002. At December 31,
2002, the Corporation’s debt was $5 billion and its
debt to capitalization ratio was 54%. As of December 31,
2004, the Corporation’s debt has been reduced to
$3.8 billion and the debt to capitalization ratio was
40.7%. Aggregate debt maturities through 2006 are
$128 million. The Corporation’s cash balance at
December 31, 2004 was $877 million.

Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2004,
$1.4 billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002. Capital
expenditures for 2005 are forecast to be $2.1 billion, with
$2.0 billion dedicated to the exploration and production
segment. This higher spending reflects the Corporation’s
portfolio of organic growth projects and attractive investment
opportunities. The Corporation has hedged approximately 60% of
its 2005 worldwide crude oil production to underpin its cash
flows to fund development projects. See further discussion on
hedging starting on page 34.

Consolidated Results of Operations

Net income in 2004 was $977 million compared with net
income of $643 million in 2003 and a net loss of
$218 million in 2002, including impairments. Included in
these amounts was income from discontinued operations of
$7 million in 2004, $169 million in 2003 and
$27 million in 2002. See the following page for a table of
items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods.

The after-tax results by major operating activity for 2004, 2003
and 2002 are summarized below:



In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to
pre-tax amounts.

The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in
income from continuing operations for the years 2004, 2003 and
2002:

The items in the table above are explained on pages 21
through 24. The pre-tax amounts are shown on pages 21, 23
and 24.

Comparison of Results

Exploration and Production:

After considering the
exploration and production items in the preceding table, the
remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are
primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production
volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as
discussed below.

Selling prices:

Higher average selling prices of
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas increased
exploration and production revenues from continuing operations
by approximately $400 million in 2004 compared with 2003.
In 2003, the change in average selling prices increased revenues
by approximately $170 million compared with 2002. The
Corporation’s average selling prices from continuing
operations, including the effects of hedging, were as follows:



The after-tax impacts of crude oil and U.S. natural gas
hedges reduced earnings by $583 million ($935 million
before income taxes) in 2004 and $260 million
($418 million before income taxes) in 2003 compared with an
increase of $48 million ($82 million before income
taxes) in 2002.

The Corporation has after-tax, deferred hedge losses of
$875 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income at December 31, 2004. Of this amount,
$680 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge
positions. The remaining $195 million deferred loss is
realized and relates to closed hedge positions. The deferred
realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying
barrels are sold in 2005.

The Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its
estimated worldwide crude oil production for 2005. The average
price per barrel for open United States crude oil hedges is
$33.06. The average price for open foreign crude oil hedges is
$31.17. Approximately 20% of the Corporation’s hedges are
WTI related and the remainder are Brent. In addition to the
gains or losses on these open hedge positions, approximately
$52 million of the $195 million deferred realized loss
will reduce first quarter 2005 earnings and the remaining
deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings over the
balance of the year. The Corporation also has approximately
24,000 barrels per day of Brent related production hedged
from 2006 to 2012. The average price of these hedge positions is
$26.20 per barrel. There were no natural gas hedges
outstanding at December 31, 2004.

Production and sales volumes:

The
Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production, on a
barrel of oil equivalent basis, was 342,000 barrels per day
in 2004, 373,000 barrels per day in 2003 and
451,000 barrels per day in 2002. Approximately 50% of the
production declines in 2004 and 2003 resulted from sales and
exchanges of oil and gas producing properties. The remainder
resulted principally from natural decline, and in 2003 compared
with 2002, disappointing results from fields acquired in the
United States in 2001 and reduced production from the Ceiba
Field in Equatorial Guinea. The Corporation anticipates that its
2005 production, including anticipated production from Libya,
will be approximately 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day. See page 27 for the current status of the discussions
on the Corporation’s return to Libya. The
Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows:

*

Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of
    relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).



Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue from
continuing operations of approximately $75 million in 2004
compared with 2003 and lower revenue of approximately
$425 million in 2003 compared with 2002.

Operating costs and exploration expenses:

Operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing
operations decreased by approximately $115 million in 2004
compared with 2003 and increased by $70 million in 2003
compared with 2002. Depreciation, depletion and amortization
charges were lower in 2004 and 2003 principally reflecting
decreased production volumes. Exploration expenses were lower in
2004 as a result of lower dry hole costs. Exploration expenses
were higher in 2003, reflecting increased activity in the United
States and Equatorial Guinea, as well as additional lease cost
amortization. Production expenses increased in 2004 and 2003
primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar which
increased costs incurred in foreign currencies. In addition,
higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased the
costs of production taxes, transportation, maintenance and fuel.
Unit costs per barrel totaled $17.26 in 2004, $17.32 in 2003 and
$15.11 in 2002. Unit cost per barrel includes production
expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration
expense and administrative costs.

Other:

After-tax foreign currency gains amounted
to $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in
2004, compared with a loss of $22 million ($4 million
before income taxes) in 2003 and income of $6 million
($26 million before income taxes) in 2002.

Excluding items in the following table, the effective income tax
rate for exploration and production operations in 2004 was 46%.
This includes income taxes paid in jurisdictions with rates in
excess of the United States statutory rate, such as the United
Kingdom and Norway. It also reflects an income tax deduction for
the Corporation’s hedging results at the
U.S. statutory rate. Each of these factors increases the
Corporation’s overall exploration and production effective
income tax rate. The effective income tax rate for exploration
and production operations in 2005 is expected to be in the range
of 45% to 49%. Assuming agreements are finalized and the
Corporation returns to Libya, the exploration and production
effective income tax rate will exceed the range above.

Exploration and production earnings from continuing operations

2004:

The Corporation recognized gains on the sales of an
office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non-producing property
in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also
recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in
tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation accrued an
additional amount for severance and costs for vacated office
space during 2004. Additional accruals for vacated office space
of approximately $35 million before income taxes are
anticipated in 2005.

2003:

The Corporation recorded an after-tax charge of
$32 million for accrued severance in the United States and
United Kingdom and a reduction of leased office space in London.
The pre-tax amount of this charge was $53 million, of which
$32 million relates to vacated office space. The remainder
of $21 million relates to severance for positions that were
eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston.

The Corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the
recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain
prior year foreign exploration expenses. The gain from asset
sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the Corporation’s 1.5%
interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System.

2002:

Exploration and production earnings included
after-tax asset impairments of $737 million,
$530 million of which related to the Ceiba Field in
Equatorial Guinea. The pre-tax amount of the Ceiba Field
impairment was $706 million. The charge resulted from a 12%
reduction in the estimated total field reserves that will
ultimately be produced from the field, as well as higher
anticipated development costs needed to produce the remaining
reserves at lower production rates over a longer period. The
reduction in estimated recoverable reserves was attributable to
disappointing 2002 year-end drilling results on the western
flank of the field. The reduction in probable reserves and
higher estimated future development costs resulted in an asset
impairment because projected cash flows were less than the book
value of the field, which includes allocated purchase price from
the Triton acquisition.

The Corporation also recorded an after-tax impairment charge of
$207 million to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas
properties located primarily in the Main Pass/ Breton Sound area
of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of these properties were obtained in
the 2001 LLOG acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas
fields with proved and probable reserves and exploration
acreage. This charge principally reflects reduced reserve
estimates on these fields resulting from unfavorable production
performance. The fair values of producing properties were
determined by using discounted cash flows. Exploration
properties were evaluated by using results of drilling and
production data from nearby fields and seismic data for these
and other properties in the area.

During 2002, the United Kingdom government enacted a 10%
supplementary tax on profits from oil and gas production. A
one-time charge of $43 million was recorded to increase the
existing United Kingdom deferred tax liability on the balance
sheet.

The gain on asset sales in 2002 reflected the disposal of oil
and gas producing properties in the United States, United
Kingdom and Azerbaijan, and the Corporation’s energy
marketing business in the United Kingdom.

The Corporation’s future exploration and production
earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility
in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and
production changes and changes in tax rates.

Refining and Marketing:

Earnings from refining and
marketing activities amounted to $451 million in 2004,
$327 million in 2003 and $85 million in 2002. The
Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA L.L.C.
(HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary
of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted
for using the equity method. Additional refining and marketing
activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy
marketing and trading operations. In 2004, the Corporation
invested in a 50% joint venture, Hess LNG L.L.C., to pursue
investments in liquified natural gas terminals and related
supply, trading and marketing opportunities.

HOVENSA:

The Corporation’s share of
HOVENSA’s income was $244 million in 2004, compared
with income of $117 million in 2003 and a loss of
$47 million in 2002. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were



due primarily to higher refining margins compared with prior
years. HOVENSA’s total crude runs amounted to
484,000 barrels per day in 2004, 440,000 barrels per
day in 2003 and 361,000 barrels per day in 2002. In late
2002 and early 2003, crude oil deliveries to HOVENSA were
interrupted due to political disturbances in Venezuela. For the
remainder of 2003 and in 2004, HOVENSA received contracted
quantities of crude oil from PDVSA. The fluid catalytic cracking
unit at HOVENSA operated at 139,000, 142,000 and
116,000 barrels per day in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA commenced production in
August 2002. The unit operated at the rate of
55,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 53,000 barrels per
day in 2003. Planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking
unit at HOVENSA was completed during the first quarter of 2005.

Earnings from refining and marketing activities also include
interest income on the note received from PDVSA at the formation
of the joint venture. Interest on the PDVSA note amounted to
$25 million in 2004, $30 million in 2003 and
$35 million in 2002. Interest income is reflected in
non-operating income in the income statement. In 2004, the
Corporation recorded deferred income tax expense of
$32 million in refining and marketing results relating to
HOVENSA’s earnings and interest on the PDVSA note. In 2005,
the Corporation expects that deferred income taxes will be
recorded at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5%. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has approximately
$190 million of net operating loss carryforwards available
to offset its share of future HOVENSA taxable income.

Retail, Energy Marketing and Other:

Retail
gasoline operations in 2004 were profitable but less so than in
2003, reflecting lower margins. Earnings from retail gasoline
operations were higher in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting
higher margins. Energy marketing earnings were lower in 2004
compared with 2003 because of lower margins. Energy marketing
activities had higher earnings in 2003, reflecting increased
margins and sales volumes in the early part of the year
resulting from the cold winter. Results of the Port Reading
refining facility improved in 2004 reflecting higher margins
than in 2003, which was also an improvement over 2002 results.
Total refined product sales volumes were 428,000 barrels
per day in 2004, 419,000 barrels per day in 2003 and
383,000 barrels per day in 2002. Planned maintenance at the
Port Reading fluid catalytic cracking unit is underway in the
first quarter of 2005.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the
trading partnership amounted to income of $37 million in
2004, $17 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002.
Before income taxes, the trading income was $72 million in
2004, $30 million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002.

Marketing expenses increased in 2004 compared with 2003
reflecting higher expenses from retail operations and the
trading partnership.

Refining and marketing earnings include the following items:

In 2004, refining and marketing results include income of
$12 million from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. In
2003, refining and marketing earnings were reduced by a loss
from the sale of the Corporation’s interest in a shipping
joint venture. In 2002, the Corporation completed the sale of
six United States flag vessels for $161 million in cash and
a note for $29 million. The sale resulted in a net gain of
$67 million. In connection with this sale, the Corporation
agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels
for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if the
actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than
the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation
will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate
and the stipulated rate. At January 1, 2004, the charter
support reserve was $32 million. During 2004, the
Corporation made net payments of $4 million for charter
support. Based on contractual long-term charters and estimates
of future charter rates, the Corporation lowered the estimated
charter support reserve by $18 million in 2004. The balance
in this reserve at December 31, 2004 was $10 million.
In 2002, the Corporation recorded a charge for the write-off of
intangible assets in its U.S. energy marketing business. In
addition, severance was recorded for cost reduction initiatives
in refining and marketing, principally energy marketing.

Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be
volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply
and demand factors, including the effects of weather.

Corporate:

After-tax corporate expenses amounted
to $85 million in 2004, $101 million in 2003 and
$63 million in 2002. The 2004 corporate expenses include
$13 million ($20 million before income taxes) of
insurance costs related to retrospective premium increases. In
addition, corporate results include an income tax benefit of
$13 million from the settlement of a federal tax audit. The
2003 amount includes expenses of $34 million for premiums
paid on the repurchase of bonds compared with $6 million in
2002. The pre-tax amounts of the bond repurchase premiums were
$58 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2002 and are
recorded in non-operating income (expense) in the income
statement. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses for 2005 are
estimated to be in the range of $90 to $100 million.

Interest incurred decreased in 2004 and 2003 reflecting lower
average outstanding debt. After-tax interest expense in 2005 is
anticipated to be lower than the 2004 level because of higher
estimated capitalized interest.

Discontinued Operations:

In 2003, the Corporation
exchanged its crude oil producing properties in Colombia
(acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton acquisition), plus
$10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in
Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand (JDA). The exchange resulted



in an after-tax charge to income of $47 million
($51 million before income taxes). The after-tax loss on
this exchange included a $43 million adjustment of the book
value of the Colombian assets to fair value. The loss also
included $17 million from the recognition in earnings of
the value of related hedge contracts at the time of the
exchange. These items were partially offset by after-tax
earnings in Colombia prior to the exchange of $13 million.
Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004
reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency
relating to the Colombian asset exchange.

In 2003, the Corporation also sold Gulf of Mexico shelf
properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small
United Kingdom fields for $445 million. The after-tax gain
from these asset sales of $176 million ($248 million
before income taxes) was included in discontinued operations.
Discontinued operations in 2003 also included $40 million
of income from operations prior to the sales of these assets.

Change in Accounting Principle:

The Corporation
adopted FAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, effective January 1, 2003. A
net after-tax gain of $7 million resulting from the
cumulative effect of this accounting change was recorded at the
beginning of 2003. At the date of adoption, a liability of
$556 million representing the estimated fair value of the
Corporation’s required dismantlement obligations was
recorded on the balance sheet. In addition, a dismantlement
asset of $311 million was recorded, as well as accumulated
depreciation of $203 million.

Sales and Other Operating Revenues:

In 2004, sales
and other operating revenues totaled $16,733 million, an
increase of 17% compared with 2003. This increase principally
reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined
products, partially offset by decreased sales of purchased
natural gas in energy marketing. Sales and other operating
revenues increased by 24% in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting
increased sales volumes and selling prices of refined products
and the higher selling price of purchased natural gas in energy
marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each
year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined
products and purchased natural gas.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview:

Cash flows from operating activities,
including changes in operating assets and liabilities, totaled
$1,903 million in 2004. During the year, the Corporation
repaid $106 million of debt, which decreased its debt to
capitalization ratio to 40.7% at December 31, 2004 from
42.5% at December 31, 2003. Total debt was
$3,835 million at December 31, 2004 and
$3,941 million at December 31, 2003. The Corporation
has debt maturities of $128 million during the next two
years. In 2004, the Corporation entered into a new
$2.5 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in 2009.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2004 totaled
$877 million, an increase of $359 million for the year.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities:

Net cash
provided by operating activities, including changes in operating
assets and liabilities, totaled $1,903 million in 2004,
$1,581 million in 2003 and $1,965 million in 2002. The
increased cash flows in 2004 resulted primarily from higher
earnings and the timing of cash flows associated with changes in
operating assets and liabilities. In 2004, the Corporation also
received a cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA.
Lower cash flows in 2003 were primarily due to reduced
exploration and production sales volumes. Changes in operating
assets and liabilities increased cash flow by $230 million
in 2004 and decreased cash flow by $120 million in 2003.



Cash Flows from Investing Activities:

The
following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital
expenditures in 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Proceeds from asset sales in 2004 totaled $57 million. In
2003, the Corporation sold certain producing properties in the
Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia, several
small United Kingdom fields and an interest in a shipping joint
venture. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $545 million in
2003. In addition, the Corporation completed several asset
exchanges. The Corporation swapped mature, high-cost assets in
Colombia for an additional 25% interest in long-lived natural
gas reserves in Block A-18 in the joint development area of
Malaysia and Thailand, bringing the Corporation’s interest
in the area to 50%. The Corporation exchanged its 25% equity
investment in Premier Oil plc for a 23% interest in Natuna Sea
Block A in Indonesia, plus approximately $10 million in
cash. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged
14% interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United
Kingdom for an additional 22.5% interest in the Llano Field in
the Gulf of Mexico and $17 million in cash. This exchange
increased the Corporation’s working interest in the Llano
Field to 50% and decreased its interest in the Scott Field to
21% and the Telford Field to 17%. The net production from fields
sold or exchanged in 2003 at the time of disposition was
approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

In 2002, the Corporation sold six United States Flag vessels,
its energy marketing business in the United Kingdom and several
small oil and gas fields for net proceeds of $412 million.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities:

The
Corporation reduced debt by $106 million in 2004,
$1,051 million in 2003 and $673 million in 2002. The
debt reduction in 2004 was due to cash flow from operations. In
2003, debt was reduced by proceeds from the issuance of
preferred stock and from asset sales, as well as cash flow from
operations. In 2003, the Corporation issued
13,500,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock
for net proceeds of $653 million. In 2004, the Corporation
received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling
$90 million. Dividends paid were $157 million in 2004,
$108 million in 2003 and $107 million in 2002. The
increase in 2004 was due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock
issued in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Future Capital Requirements and Resources:

Capital
expenditures in 2005 are expected to be approximately
$2.1 billion, including an estimated amount for re-entering
Libya. The Corporation anticipates that these expenditures will
be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations,
however, revolving credit facilities are available, if necessary.

With higher crude oil prices, the Corporation’s collateral
requirements under certain contracts with hedging and trading
counterparties have increased. Outstanding letters of credit
were $1,487 million at December 31, 2004, including
$570 million drawn against the Corporation’s
$2.5 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility,
compared with outstanding letters of credit of $229 million
at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the
Corporation has $1,930 million available under its
committed revolving credit



agreement and has additional unused lines of credit of
approximately $150 million, primarily for letters of
credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The
Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may
issue $825 million of additional debt securities, warrants,
common stock or preferred stock.

Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an
additional $5.5 billion for the construction or acquisition
of assets at December 31, 2004. At year end, the maximum
amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from
borrowings under the loan agreements is $2.0 billion.

The Corporation’s aggregate maturities of long-term debt
total $128 million over the next two years. Based on
current estimates of production, capital expenditures and other
factors, and assuming West Texas Intermediate oil prices average
$35 per barrel and United States natural gas prices average
$6 per Mcf, the Corporation anticipates it will fund its
2005 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends and
required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand and cash
flow from operations. If necessary, additional financing is
available from its revolving credit facility and shelf
registration.

Libya:

Prior to June 30, 1986, the
Corporation had extensive exploration and production operations
in Libya; however, U.S. government sanctions required
suspension of participation in these operations. The Corporation
wrote off the book value of its Libyan assets in connection with
the cessation of operations. During 2004, the Corporation
received U.S. government authorization to negotiate and
execute an agreement with the government of Libya that would
define the terms for resuming active participation in the Libyan
properties. The U.S. Government has lifted most of the
sanctions imposed on Libya and has rescinded the Libya portions
of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1976. As a result, the
Corporation and its partners will be able to resume operations
in Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to
ongoing commercial negotiations.

Repatriation Provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004:

On October 22, 2004, the President signed
the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) that effectively
provides for a one-time reduction of the income tax rate to
5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a
U.S. parent. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the
Corporation decided to repatriate approximately
$1.3 billion of unremitted foreign earnings. As a result,
the Corporation expects to record a tax provision of
approximately $41 million in the first quarter of 2005. Had
the additional taxes been recorded at the end of 2004, net
income would have been $936 million ($9.93 per share
basic and $9.17 per share diluted). The Corporation is
reviewing the possibility of additional repatriations during
2005. The maximum additional amount that the Corporation could
repatriate under the Act is approximately $600 million. The
Corporation estimates that an additional tax provision of up to
$32 million would be recorded, depending on the incremental
amount distributed, if any.

Credit Ratings:

In 2004, two credit rating
agencies downgraded their ratings of the Corporation’s
debt. One of the revised ratings was below investment grade. If
another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below
investment grade, the Corporation would have to comply with a
more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving
credit facility. In addition, the incremental margin
requirements with hedging and trading counterparties at
December 31, 2004 would be approximately $23 million.

The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined
    product supply from HOVENSA. Current purchases amount to
    approximately $2.4 billion annually.



In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Also included are
normal term purchase agreements at market prices for additional
gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail
marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to
purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers
in its energy marketing business. These commitments were
computed based on year-end market prices.

The table also reflects that portion of the Corporation’s
planned capital expenditures that are contractually committed at
December 31. The Corporation’s 2005 capital
expenditures are estimated to be approximately
$2.1 billion. Obligations for operating expenses include
commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas
production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other
long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed
obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including
minimum pension plan funding requirements.

In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the
Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on
these vessels for up to five years. The support agreement
requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a
vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the
agreement, the Corporation will pay to the buyer the difference
between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. The balance
in the charter support reserve at December 31, 2004 was
$10 million.

The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire
the remaining 50% interest in a retail marketing and gasoline
station joint venture for approximately $90 million.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates
based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices
and at December 31, 2004 amounted to $97 million. In
addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a
maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have
funds to meet its senior debt obligations.

At December 31, the Corporation has $1,415 million of
letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities
with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance
sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under
letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other
entities directly related to its business, as follows:

    Corporation owns a 5% interest and $45 million for an oil
    pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

The Corporation
has leveraged lease financings not included in its balance
sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
Corporation operates. The net present value of these financings
is $467 million at December 31, 2004 compared with
$462 million at December 31, 2003. The
Corporation’s December 31, 2004 debt to capitalization
ratio would increase from 40.7% to 43.5% if the lease financings
were included as debt.

Contingencies”

Venture,” and Note 16, “Guarantees and
Contingencies,” in the financial statements.



Foreign Operations:

The Corporation conducts
exploration and production activities in many foreign countries,
including the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Gabon, Indonesia,
Thailand, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Malaysia and Equatorial Guinea.
Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated
with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk
(including tax law changes) and currency risk. The effects of
these events are accounted for when they occur and generally
have not been material to the Corporation’s liquidity or
financial position.

HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by
Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a
refinery in the Virgin Islands. Although there have in the past
been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the
availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining
operations, these disruptions did not have a material adverse
effect on the Corporation’s financial position. The
Corporation also has a note receivable of $273 million at
December 31, 2004 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. The
Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
accounting methods used can affect net income,
stockholders’ equity and various financial statement
ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies
generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs:

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring
unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including
lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are
capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and
exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of
drilling and equipping productive wells, including development
dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found. In an area requiring a major capital
expenditure before production can begin, an exploration well is
carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to
justify its completion as a production well, and additional
exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned. The
Corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory
wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:

The
determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant
element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration
and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves
affect well capitalizations, undeveloped leasehold impairments
and the unit of production depreciation rates of proved
properties, wells and equipment. Reductions in reserve estimates
may result in the need for increased depreciation or impairments
of proved properties and related assets.

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
producible, government approvals must be obtained and depending
on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the
board of directors must commit to fund the project. The
Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting
process involves an annual independent third party reserve
determination as well as internal technical appraisals of
reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the
estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary
Oil and Gas Data in accordance with FAS No. 69 are
determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and
MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal
estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with
engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production
histories and other information necessary for the reserve



determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s
technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information
provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review
the final reserve estimates issued by D&M.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:

As
explained below there are significant differences in the way
long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for
impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets,
including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may
not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested at the lowest
level for which cash flows are identifiable and are largely
independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not
expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow
estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is
recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated
fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated
future net cash flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted
at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected
production volumes represent reserves, including probable
reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount
of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and
timing of production are consistent with internal projections
and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices
used for determining asset impairments will generally differ
from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use
of actual prices on the last day of the year.

The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived
exploration and production producing assets are based on its
best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery
factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the
timing of future production, which are updated each time an
impairment test is performed. In 2002, the Corporation recorded
impairments of the Ceiba Field and LLOG properties that were
required primarily because of reduced estimates of oil and gas
production volumes and, in the case of Ceiba, anticipated
additional development costs. The impairment charges did not
result from changes in the other factors. The change in the
estimated timing of production on the Ceiba Field did not
significantly affect the undiscounted future cash flows, but did
significantly reduce the fair value of the field determined by
discounted cash flows. The Corporation could have additional
impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas
fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil
and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset
impairments.

The Corporation recorded $977 million of goodwill in
connection with the purchase of Triton Energy Limited in 2001.
Factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill included the
strategic value of expanding global operations to access new
growth areas outside of the United States and the North Sea,
obtaining critical mass in Africa and Southeast Asia, and
synergies, including cost savings, improved processes and
portfolio high grading opportunities. In accordance with
FAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but must
be tested for impairment annually. FAS No. 142
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting
unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and
measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from
the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is
an operating segment or a component that is one level below an
operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the
component constitutes a business for which discrete financial
information is available and segment management regularly
reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or
more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and
deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar
economic characteristics. An operating segment shall be deemed a
reporting unit if all of its components are economically similar.

Within the Corporation’s exploration and production
operating segment there are currently two components:
(1) Americas and West Africa and (2) Europe, North
Africa and Asia. Each component has a manager who reports to the
segment manager. The Corporation has determined the components
have similar economic characteristics and, therefore, has
aggregated the components into a single reporting
unit — the exploration and production operating
segment. As a result, goodwill has been assigned to the
exploration and production operating segment. If the Corporation
reorganized its exploration and production business such



that there was more than one operating segment, or its
components were no longer economically similar, goodwill would
be assigned to two or more reporting units. The goodwill would
be allocated to any new reporting units using a relative fair
value approach in accordance with FAS No. 142.
Goodwill impairment testing for lower level reporting units
could result in the recognition of an impairment that would not
otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of
aggregation.

The Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be
recovered through the operation of the exploration and
production segment as a whole and it evaluated the following
characteristics in determining that the components are
economically similar:

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration
and production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted
anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known
developments, (2) the expected risked present value of
exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to
reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential
synergies including cost savings, access to new business
opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and
increased market share. The Corporation also considers the
relative market valuation of similar exploration and production
companies.

The determination of the fair value of the exploration and
production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and
gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and
market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and
natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a
decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production
operating segment that could result in an impairment of
goodwill. In addition, changes in management structure or sales
or dispositions of a portion of the exploration and production
segment may result in goodwill impairment.

Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived
assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
would not cause an impairment of the $977 million of
goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment. In
2002, the Corporation recognized asset impairments because
reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes caused the
expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets to be lower than
the asset carrying amounts. No impairment of goodwill existed
because the fair value of the overall exploration and production
operating segment continued to exceed its recorded book value.

Segments:

The Corporation has two operating
segments, exploration and production, and refining and
marketing. Management has determined that these are its
operating segments because, in accordance with
FAS No. 131, these are the segments of the Corporation
(i) that engage in business activities from which revenues
are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating
results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief
operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segment and assess its performance and
(iii) for which discrete financial information is
available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation, is the chief operating decision maker (CODM)
as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible
for performing the functions within the Corporation of
allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the
Corporation’s operating segments. The CODM uses only the
operating results of each segment as a whole to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess
the segment performance. The CODM manages each segment globally
and does not regularly review the operating results of any
component (e.g., geographic area) or asset within each



segment or any such information by geographical location, oil
and gas property or project, subsidiary or division, to make
decisions about resources to be allocated or to assess
performance. While the CODM does review and approve initial
corporate funding for a new project using information about the
project, he does not review subsequent operating results by
project after the initial funding. Each operating segment has
one manager. The segment managers are responsible for allocating
resources within the segments, reviewing financial results of
components within the segments, and assessing the performance of
the components. The CODM evaluates the performance of the
segment managers based on performance metrics related to each
manager’s operating segment as a whole. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation does not receive more detailed
information than that used by the CODM to operate and manage the
Corporation.

Hedging:

The Corporation may use futures,
forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to
reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and
refined product selling prices. Related hedge gains or losses
are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices.
Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of
expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow
hedges), and the changes in fair value are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet
the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation.
The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included
in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the
time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective
portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The
Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign
currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change
in fair value is included in income currently. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $875 million of
deferred exploration and production hedging losses, after income
taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Income Taxes:

Judgments are required in the
determination and recognition of income tax assets and
liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net
operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including
the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for
those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax
assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and
tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments
are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being
realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that
will be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax
assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for
temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net
operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the
availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of
appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future
taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves
and selling prices that are consistent with the
Corporation’s internal business forecasts.

Environment, Health and Safety

The Corporation has implemented a values-based,
socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment,
health and safety performance and making a positive impact on
communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s
environment, health, safety and social responsibility policies
and by environment and safety management systems that help
protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local
communities. The Corporation’s management systems are based
on international standards and are intended to promote internal
consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual
improvement in EHS performance. Improved performance may
increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also
require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks
to assets, reputation and license to operate. While overall
governance is the responsibility of senior management, the
Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory
compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally
meet corporate EHS goals.

The Port Reading refining facility and the HOVENSA refinery
manufacture conventional and reformulated gasolines that are
cleaner burning than that required under current
U.S. regulations. The production of motor and other fuels
in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing
regulatory pressures to reduce sulfur content in recent years.
In 2004, new regulations went into effect that significantly
reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional rules to reduce
the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel will go into effect
in 2006. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to
more stringent regulation in future years and as such may
require additional large capital expenditures.



The Corporation and HOVENSA continue to evaluate options to
determine the most cost effective compliance strategies for
known fuel regulations. Estimated capital expenditures necessary
to comply with low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading
are approximately $70 million over the next two years.
Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and
diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be
approximately $400 million in total, $50 million of
which has already been spent. Remaining capital expenditures are
projected to be $350 million over the next two years.
HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash
flow from operations. If it becomes necessary to finance a
portion of the capital expenditures, HOVENSA has
$400 million of available revolving credit capacity.

Federal legislation to restrict or ban the use of MTBE, a
gasoline oxygenate, and to require the use of
‘renewable’ fuels was considered by the United States
Congress in 2004 and will likely be reconsidered in 2005. The
Corporation and HOVENSA both manufacture and use MTBE, where
permitted, to meet the federal requirement for oxygen in
reformulated gasoline. In states within the Corporation’s
marketing area where MTBE bans have been enacted, such as
Connecticut and New York, the Corporation markets reformulated
gasoline without oxygenates and ethanol is added to the gasoline
downstream from the refineries to meet regulatory requirements.
If Congress bans MTBE nationally or if additional state bans
take effect, or if an obligation to use ethanol or other
renewable fuels is imposed, the effect on the Corporation and
HOVENSA could be significant. Whether the effect is significant
will depend on several factors, including the extent and timing
of any such bans of MTBE or obligations to use ethanol,
requirements for maintenance of certain air emission reductions
if MTBE is banned, the cost and availability of alternative
oxygenates or credits and whether the minimum oxygen content
standard for reformulated gasoline remains in effect. The
Corporation will continue to review various options to market
and produce reformulated gasolines if additional MTBE bans take
effect.

As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in
2003, the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the
U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining
Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed
to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries.
Since 2000, EPA has entered into settlements addressing these
emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over
50% of the nation’s refining capacity in 26 states and
negotiations continue with many refiners. Depending on the
outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may
experience increased capital and operating expenses related to
air emissions controls. The PRI allows for controls to be phased
in over several years.

The Corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the
environmental and social impact of air emissions. On a global
scale, climate change is an issue that has prompted much public
debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and
development. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess,
monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,”
including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated
with this program may be significant, not only from the
standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the
perspective of adequately measuring the Corporation’s
entire greenhouse gas inventory.

The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for
environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to
existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be
necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore
exploration and production facilities, refineries (including
solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not
currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the
Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party.

The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and
reasonably estimable. At year-end 2004, the Corporation’s
reserve for its estimated environmental liability was
approximately $81 million. The Corporation does not
discount its environmental liability. The Corporation expects
that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will
adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites.
Remediation spending was $12 million in 2004 and 2003 and
$9 million in 2002. Capital expenditures for facilities,
primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental
standards, were $1 million in 2004, $7 million in 2003 and
$5 million in 2002.



Forward Looking Information

Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including
references to the Corporation’s future results of
operations and financial position, liquidity and capital
resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax
rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and
environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and
contractual obligations and contingencies include forward
looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on
the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of
these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future.
Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of
changes in market conditions, government actions and other
factors.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as
non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading
operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a
trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to
commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil,
natural gas and refined products. The following describes how
these risks are controlled and managed.

Controls:

The Corporation maintains a control
environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and
through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s
senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric,
term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk
officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities.
Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to
business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s
risk management department also performs independent
verifications of sources of fair values and validations of
valuation models. These controls apply to all of the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including
the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s
treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and
interest rate hedging programs.

Instruments:

The Corporation primarily uses
forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts,
futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked securities
in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are
widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. The
following describes these instruments and how the Corporation
uses them:



•

Energy Commodity Linked Securities:

Securities where the
    price is linked to the price of an underlying energy commodity.
    These securities may be issued by a company or government.

Quantitative Measures:

The Corporation uses
value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its
trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses
historical simulation and the results represent the potential
loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The
model captures both first and second order sensitivities for
options. The potential change in fair value based on commodity
price risk is presented in the non-trading and trading sections
below.

For foreign exchange rate risk, the impact of a 10% change in
foreign exchange rates on the value of the Corporation’s
portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts is presented in
the non-trading section. Similarly, the impact of a 15% change
in interest rates on the fair value of the Corporation’s
debt is also presented in the non-trading section. A 10% change
in foreign exchange rates and a 15% change in the rate of
interest over one year are considered reasonable possibilities
for providing sensitivity disclosures.

Non-Trading:

The Corporation’s non-trading
activities include hedging of crude oil and natural gas
production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices
of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the
related gains or losses are an integral part of the
Corporation’s selling prices. As of December 31, the
Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its
estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil production. The average price
for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) related open hedge
positions is $33.06. The average price for Brent crude oil
related open hedge positions is $31.17. Approximately 20% of the
Corporation’s hedges is WTI related and the remainder is
Brent. In addition, the Corporation has approximately
24,000 barrels per day of Brent related crude oil
production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an average price of
$26.20 per barrel. There were no hedges of natural gas
production at year end. As market conditions change, the
Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages.

Because the selling price of crude oil has increased during
2004, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
December 31, 2004 includes after-tax deferred losses of
$875 million ($195 million of realized losses and
$680 million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil
contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales.
Realized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income
represent losses on closed contracts that are deferred until the
underlying barrels are sold. In addition to the impact of the
open hedge positions described above, approximately
$52 million of the realized losses will reduce earnings in
the first quarter of 2005 and the remainder will reduce earnings
during the balance of 2005. The pre-tax amount of all deferred
hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related
income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the
balance sheet.

The Corporation also markets energy commodities including
refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The
Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of
commodities to be sold under fixed-price sales contracts.

The following table summarizes the value-at-risk results of
commodity related derivatives that are settled in cash and used
in non-trading activities. The results may vary from time to
time as hedge levels change.



The increase in the value at risk in 2004 principally reflects
additional hedge positions on Brent related production for the
years 2006 through 2012.

The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling
and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2004, the
Corporation has $476 million of notional value foreign
exchange contracts maturing in 2005 ($384 million at
December 31, 2003). The fair value of foreign exchange
contracts recorded as assets was $49 million at
December 31, 2004 ($40 million at December 31,
2003). The change in fair value of the foreign exchange
contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is estimated to be
$53 million at December 31, 2004 ($43 million at
December 31, 2003).

At December 31, 2004, the interest rate on substantially
all of the Corporation’s debt was fixed and there were no
interest rate swaps. The Corporation’s outstanding debt of
$3,835 million has a fair value of $4,327 million at
December 31, 2004 (debt of $3,941 million at
December 31, 2003 had a fair value of $4,440 million).
A 15% change in the rate of interest would change the fair value
of debt by approximately $260 million at December 31,
2004 and by approximately $270 million at December 31,
2003.

Trading:

The trading partnership in which the
Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities
and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are
consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also
takes trading positions for its own account. These strategies
include proprietary position management and trading to enhance
the potential return on assets. The information that follows
represents 100% of the trading partnership and the
Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.

In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in
crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in
North America and Europe. Trading positions include futures,
forwards, swaps and options. In some cases, physical purchase
and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are
included in the trading results.

Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are
marked-to-market and are reflected in income currently. Total
realized gains for the year amounted to $79 million. The
following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting
the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents
100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities.

The Corporation uses observable market values for determining
the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where
actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources
are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in
actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets
and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are
based on internal models incorporating underlying market
information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The
Corporation’s risk management department



regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2004.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Amerada Hess Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Amerada Hess Corporation and
consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amerada Hess
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of
consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in
preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value
and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated
February 21, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on these
statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Amerada Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of
consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in
preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value
and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included
the Financial Statement Schedule listed in the Index at
Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related Financial Statement Schedule, when considered in
relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Amerada Hess Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:

Amerada Hess Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Corporation) engage in the exploration for and
the production, purchase, transportation and sale of crude oil
and natural gas. These activities are conducted in the United
States, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea,
Algeria, Azerbaijan, Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and
other countries. In addition, the Corporation manufactures,
purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum and
other energy products. The Corporation owns 50% of HOVENSA
L.L.C., a refinery joint venture in the United States Virgin
Islands. An additional refining facility, terminals and retail
gasoline stations are located on the East Coast of the United
States.

In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in
the income statement. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Among the estimates made by management are oil and
gas reserves, asset valuations, depreciable lives, pension
liabilities, environmental obligations, dismantlement costs and
income taxes.

Certain information in the financial statements and notes has
been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Amerada Hess
Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
consolidated.

Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned, including
HOVENSA but excluding a trading partnership, are stated at cost
of acquisition plus the Corporation’s equity in
undistributed net income since acquisition. The change in the
equity in net income of these companies is included in
non-operating income in the income statement. The Corporation
consolidates the trading partnership in which it owns a 50%
voting interest and over which it exercises control.

Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
consolidation.

Revenue Recognition:

The Corporation recognizes
revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products and other merchandise when title passes to the
customer. The Corporation recognizes revenues from the
production of natural gas properties based on sales to
customers. Differences between natural gas volumes sold and the
Corporation’s share of natural gas production are not
material.

In its exploration and production activities, the Corporation
enters into buy-sell arrangements for crude oil that involve
linked sale and purchase transactions for the primary purpose of
changing location or quality. These arrangements are reported
net in the income statement. In its refining and marketing
activities, the Corporation exchanges refined products with
other oil companies and enters into buy-sell arrangements that
involve linked sale and purchase transactions with the same
counterparty for the purpose of changing location and quality.
These arrangements are reported net in the income statement. The
amount of netted buy-sell transactions is less than 10% of sales
in each year in the three year period ended December 31,
2004.

Derivatives (futures, forwards, options and swaps) used in
energy trading activities are marked to market, with net gains
and losses recorded in operating revenue. Gains or losses from
the sale of physical products are recorded at the time of sale.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents
consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily
convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or
less when acquired.

Inventories:

Crude oil and refined product
inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
For inventories valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method.



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories of merchandise, materials and supplies are valued at
the lower of average cost or market.

Exploration and Development Costs:

Oil and gas
exploration and production activities are accounted for using
the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and
proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses,
brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized.
Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry
hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and
equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and
related production facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found. In an area requiring a major capital
expenditure before production can begin, an exploration well is
carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to
justify its completion as a production well, and additional
exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned. The
Corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory
wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization:

The
Corporation calculates depletion expense for acquisition costs
of proved properties using the units of production method over
proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense
for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated
using the units of production method over proved developed oil
and gas reserves. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment
is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated
useful lives. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and
gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

On January 1,
2003, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset
retirement obligations as required by FAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

. Previously,
the Corporation had accrued the estimated costs of
dismantlement, restoration and abandonment, less estimated
salvage values, of offshore oil and gas production platforms and
pipelines using the units-of-production method. This cost was
reported as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated
depreciation. Using the new accounting method required by
FAS No. 143, the Corporation recognizes a liability
for the fair value of legally required asset retirement
obligations associated with long-lived assets in the period in
which the retirement obligations are incurred. The Corporation
capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the
carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The cumulative effect
of this change on prior years resulted in a credit to income of
$7 million or $.07 per share, basic and diluted. The
cumulative effect is included in income for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The effect of the change on the year
2003 was to increase income before the cumulative effect of the
accounting change by $3 million, after-tax ($.03 per
share diluted).

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The Corporation
reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas properties at a
field level, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
recovered. If the carrying amounts are not expected to be
recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the assets are
impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In
the case of oil and gas fields, the net present value of future
cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future
prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical
prices and published forward prices, applied to projected
production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production
volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves,
expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital
expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of
production are consistent with internal projections and other
externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for
determining asset impairments will generally differ from the
year-end prices used in the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The Corporation
reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than
temporary decline in value has



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

occurred. The amount of the impairment is based on quoted market
prices, where available, or other valuation techniques,
including discounted cash flows.

Impairment of Goodwill:

In accordance with
FAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, goodwill cannot be amortized; however, it must be
tested annually for impairment. This impairment test is
calculated at the reporting unit level, which is the exploration
and production segment for the Corporation’s goodwill. The
Corporation identifies potential impairments by comparing the
fair value of the reporting unit to its book value, including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, the Corporation calculates the possible
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill
with the carrying amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill
is less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be
recorded.

Maintenance and Repairs:

The estimated costs of
major maintenance, including turnarounds at the Port Reading
refining facility, are accrued. Other expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital
improvements are recorded as additions to property, plant and
equipment.

Environmental Expenditures:

The Corporation
capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or
efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
contamination. The Corporation accrues environmental expenses to
remediate existing conditions related to past operations when
the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Corporation records
compensation expense for restricted common stock awards ratably
over the vesting period. The Corporation uses the intrinsic
value method to account for employee stock options. Because the
exercise prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the
market price of the stock on the date of grant, the Corporation
does not recognize compensation expense (see Note 9). The
following pro forma financial information presents the effect on
net income and earnings per share as if the Corporation used the
fair value method for stock options.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The U.S. dollar
is the functional currency (primary currency in which business
is conducted) for most foreign operations. For these operations,
adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets
and liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded in income.
For operations that use the local currency as the functional
currency, adjustments resulting from translating foreign
functional currency assets and liabilities into
U.S. dollars are recorded in a separate component of
stockholders’ equity



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entitled accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains or losses
resulting from transactions in other than the functional
currency are reflected in net income.

Hedging:

The Corporation may use futures,
forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to
reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and
refined product selling prices. Related hedge gains or losses
are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices.
Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of
expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow
hedges), and the changes in fair value are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet
the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation.
The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included
in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the
time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective
portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The
Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign
currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change
in fair value is included in income currently.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are determined
using the liability method. The Corporation regularly assesses
the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on estimates of
future taxable income, the availability of tax planning
strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the available
carryforward periods for net operating losses and other factors.
The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income
taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations.

Accounting Change:

The Corporation has adopted
Emerging Issues Task Force abstract 02-3,

Issues
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities

. In accordance with EITF 02-3,
the Corporation began accounting for trading inventory purchased
after October 25, 2002 at the lower of cost or market.
Inventory purchased prior to this date was marked-to-market with
changes reflected in income currently. Beginning January 1,
2003, the Corporation accounted for all trading inventory at the
lower of cost or market. This accounting change did not have a
material effect on the Corporation’s income or financial
position.

2004:

Earnings from exploration and production operations
included gains totaling $55 million from the sales of an
office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non-producing property
in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties.
Exploration and production results also reflected an additional
accrual of $15 million for vacated office lease costs.
Exploration and production earnings also included foreign income
tax adjustments of $19 million resulting from a tax law
change and a tax settlement.

Refining and marketing results include $20 million of
income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. Corporate
expenses include $20 million of insurance costs related to
retrospective premium increases and a $13 million income
tax benefit arising from the settlement of a federal tax audit.

2003:

The Corporation recorded a charge of
$58 million for premiums paid on the repurchase of bonds.
This charge is reflected in non-operating income
(expense) in the income statement.

Exploration and production results included expenses of
$53 million for accrued severance and vacated office costs.
Of this amount, $32 million relates to leased office space
and the remainder relates to severance for positions that were
eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. The 2003 expense is
reflected principally in general and administrative expense in
the income statement. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation
had a related accrual of $38 million for severance and
vacated office costs. During 2004, the Corporation accrued
$17 million of additional costs and reduced the accrual by
$16 million for severance payments and lease costs. At
December 31, 2004, the accrual for severance and vacated
office space was $39 million.

Exploration and production earnings in 2003 included income tax
benefits of $30 million reflecting the recognition of
certain prior year foreign exploration expenses for United
States income tax purposes. In addition, the Corporation
recorded a gain of $47 million from the sale of its 1.5%
interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. A loss of
$9 million was recorded in refining and marketing earnings
due to the sale of a shipping joint venture.

2002:

The Corporation recorded an impairment charge of
$706 million relating to the Ceiba field in Equatorial
Guinea. The charge resulted from a reduction in probable
reserves of approximately 12% of total field reserves, as well
as the additional development costs of producing these reserves
over a longer field life. Fair value was determined by
discounting anticipated future net cash flows. The Corporation
also recorded an impairment charge of $318 million to
reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties located
primarily in the Main Pass/Breton Sound area of the Gulf of
Mexico. Most of these properties were obtained in the 2001 LLOG
acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas fields with
proved and probable reserves and exploration acreage. This
charge principally reflects reduced reserve estimates on these
fields resulting from unfavorable production performance. The
fair values of producing properties were determined by using
discounted cash flows. Exploration properties were evaluated by
using results of drilling and production data from nearby fields
and seismic data for these and other properties in the area.
These charges were recorded in the caption asset impairments in
the income statement.

During 2002, the Corporation completed the sale of six United
States flag vessels in its refining and marketing segment for
$161 million in cash and a note for $29 million. The
sale resulted in a gain of $102 million. The Corporation
agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate for these
vessels for up to five years. A gain of $50 million was
deferred as part of the sale transaction to reflect potential
obligations of the support agreement. The support agreement
requires that, if the actual contracted rate for the charter of
a vessel is less than the stipulated charter rate in the
agreement, the Corporation pays to the buyer the difference
between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. If the
actual contracted rate exceeds the stipulated rate, the buyer
must apply such amount to reimburse the Corporation for any
payments made by the Corporation up to that date. At
January 1, 2004, the charter support reserve was
$32 million. During 2004, the Corporation paid
$4 million of charter support. Based on contractual
long-term charter rates and estimates of future charter



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rates, the Corporation lowered the estimated charter support
reserve by $18 million. At December 31, 2004, the
remaining balance in the charter support reserve was
$10 million.

Gains of $41 million were recorded during 2002 from sales
of oil and gas producing properties in the United States, United
Kingdom and Azerbaijan and the Corporation’s energy
marketing business in the United Kingdom.

In 2002, the Corporation recorded a charge of $22 million
for the write-off of intangible assets in its U.S. energy
marketing business. In addition, accrued severance of
$13 million was recorded for cost reduction initiatives in
refining and marketing, principally in energy marketing.

The United Kingdom government enacted a 10% supplementary tax on
profits from oil and gas production in 2002. Because of this tax
law change, the Corporation recorded a one-time provision for
deferred taxes of $43 million to increase the deferred tax
liability on its balance sheet.

3.

Discontinued Operations

In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing
properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton
acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional
25% interest in natural gas reserves in the joint development
area of Malaysia and Thailand. The exchange resulted in a charge
to income of $51 million before income taxes, which the
Corporation reported as a loss from discontinued operations. The
loss on this exchange included a $43 million adjustment of
the book value of the Colombian assets to fair value resulting
primarily from a revision in crude oil reserves. The loss also
included a $26 million charge from the recognition in
earnings of the value of related hedge contracts at the time of
the exchange. These items were partially offset by earnings of
$18 million in Colombia prior to the exchange. Income from
discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004 reflects the
settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to the
exchanged Colombian assets.

In 2003, the Corporation sold producing properties in the Gulf
of Mexico shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small
United Kingdom fields. The aggregate proceeds from these sales
were $445 million and the after-tax gain from disposition
was $176 million.

Sales and other operating revenues (net of intercompany sales)
from discontinued operations were $97 million in 2003 and
$381 million in 2002. Pretax operating profit for the same
periods was $82 million and $14 million, respectively.
Income tax expense (benefit) was $29 million and
$(13) million for the same periods. The net production from
fields accounted for as discontinued operations in 2003 at the
time of disposition was approximately 45,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day.

During 2004, the Corporation reduced LIFO inventories, which are
carried at lower costs than current inventory costs. The effect
of the LIFO inventory liquidation was to decrease cost of
products sold by approximately $20 million.

Refining Joint Venture

The Corporation has an investment in HOVENSA L.L.C., a 50% joint
venture with Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). HOVENSA owns
and operates a refinery in the Virgin Islands.

The Corporation accounts for its investment in HOVENSA using the
equity method. Summarized financial information for HOVENSA as
of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and for the years then
ended follows:

(a)

Before Virgin Islands income taxes, which were recorded by
    the Corporation.

During 2004, the Corporation received a cash distribution of
$88 million from HOVENSA. The Corporation’s share of
HOVENSA’s undistributed income at December 31, 2004
aggregated $398 million.

The Corporation has agreed to purchase 50% of
HOVENSA’s production of refined products at market prices,
after sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Such purchases
amounted to approximately $2,940 million during 2004,
$2,040 million during 2003 and $1,280 million during
2002. The Corporation sold crude oil to HOVENSA for
approximately $35 million during 2004, $410 million
during 2003 and $80 million during 2002. In addition, the
Corporation billed HOVENSA freight charter costs of
$75 million during 2004, $59 million during 2003 and
$20 million during 2002.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value
of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
PDVSA. At December 31, 2004, the guarantee amounted to
$97 million. This amount fluctuates based on the volume of
crude oil purchased and the related crude oil prices. In
addition, the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of
$40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to
meet its senior debt obligations.

At formation of the joint venture, PDVSA V.I., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA, purchased a 50% interest in
the fixed assets of the Corporation’s Virgin Islands
refinery for $62.5 million in cash and a 10-year note from
PDVSA V.I. for $562.5 million bearing interest at
8.46% per annum and requiring principal payments over its
term. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the principal balance
of the note was $273 million and $334 million,
respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consists of
the following:

During 2003, the Corporation recorded non-cash additions to
fixed assets of $1,340 million. Of this total,
$485 million related to assets that were previously
accounted for as an equity investment in a company that holds
natural gas reserves in Malaysia and Thailand. The remaining
$855 million resulted from asset exchanges. The Corporation
also recorded deferred income tax liabilities of
$105 million related to the asset exchanges. The assets and
liabilities relinquished in these exchanges included fixed
assets of approximately $770 million, an additional equity
investment of $145 million and deferred income tax
liabilities of $145 million.

and 2003, the capitalized costs relate to wells in process of
drilling and capitalized successful wells in the United States
Gulf of Mexico and planned developments in Equatorial Guinea,
Indonesia and Thailand. The Financial Accounting Standards Board
has issued a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) which would
further define the criteria for capitalizing exploration wells.

At December 31, 2004, the Corporation’s public fixed
rate debentures have a face value of $3,176 million
($3,160 million net of unamortized discount). Interest
rates on the debentures range from 5.9% to 8% and have a
weighted average rate of 7.3%. During 2003, the Corporation
repurchased $1,015 million of fixed rate debentures.



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2004, the Corporation entered into a new $2.5 billion
syndicated, revolving credit facility expiring in December 2009,
which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has used
$570 million of this facility for letters of credit.
Borrowings under the facility currently would bear interest at
..80% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of
..20% per annum is currently payable on the amount of the
credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to
adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain
restrictions on the amount of total borrowings and cash
dividends allowed. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation is
permitted to borrow an additional $5.5 billion for the
construction or acquisition of assets. At year-end, the amount
that can be borrowed for the payment of dividends or stock
repurchases is $2.0 billion. Under the Corporation’s
revolving credit agreement, if two stated credit rating agencies
classify the Corporation’s public debt below investment
grade, an additional covenant becomes effective requiring that
the Corporation’s ratio of total consolidated debt to
consolidated EBITDA, as defined, shall not exceed 3.5. The
Corporation would have been in compliance with this covenant had
it been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2004.
This covenant shall be deleted from the credit agreement if both
credit rating agencies’ ratings are simultaneously
investment grade.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Corporation capitalized interest of
$54 million, $41 million and $101 million,
respectively, on major development projects. The total amount of
interest paid (net of amounts capitalized), principally on
short-term and long-term debt, in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$243 million, $313 million and $274 million,
respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Corporation has outstanding restricted stock and stock
options under its Amended and Restated 1995 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. Generally, stock options vest from one to three years from
the date of grant and the exercise price equals or exceeds the
market price on the date of grant. Outstanding restricted common
stock generally vests three to five years from the date of grant.



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Corporation’s stock option activity in 2004, 2003 and
2002 consisted of the following:

Exercise prices for employee stock options at December 31,
2004 ranged from $45.81 to $89.90 per share. The
weighted-average remaining contractual life of employee stock
options is 7 years.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
fair value of employee stock options for pro forma disclosure of
the effects on net income and earnings per share. The
Corporation used the following weighted-average assumptions in
the Black-Scholes model for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively:
risk-free interest rates of 4.3%, 3.6% and 4.2%; expected stock
price volatility of .293, .288 and .262; dividend yield of 1.7%,
2.6% and 1.9%; and an expected life of seven years. The
weighted-average fair values per share of options granted for
which the exercise price equaled the market price on the date of
grant were $23.75 in 2004, $12.60 in 2003 and $19.63 in 2002.
The Corporation’s net income would have been reduced by
approximately $7 million in 2004, $1 million in 2003
and $14 million in 2002 if option expenses were recorded
using the fair value method.

Total compensation expense for restricted common stock was
$17 million in 2004, $11 million in 2003 and

including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the
income statement based on fair values. Had the Corporation
adopted FAS 123R in prior periods, the impact would have
approximated the additional expenses disclosed above and in the

Pension Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
pension plans for substantially all of its employees. In
addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
plan covering certain employees. The unfunded supplemental
pension plan provides for incremental pension payments from the
Corporation’s funds so that total pension payments equal
amounts that would have been payable from the Corporation’s
principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by
income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based
on years of service and final average salary. The Corporation
uses December 31 as the measurement date for its plans.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their recorded
amounts in the financial statements. A summary of the components
of deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31
follows:

The difference between the Corporation’s effective income
tax rate and the United States statutory rate is reconciled
below:

*

Reflects high effective tax rates in certain foreign
    jurisdictions, including special taxes in the United Kingdom and
    Norway, and losses in other jurisdictions that were benefited at
    lower rates.

The Corporation has not recorded deferred income taxes
applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations. The Corporation had undistributed earnings from
foreign subsidiaries of approximately $4 billion at
December 31, 2004. On October 22, 2004, the President
signed the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) that effectively
provides for a one-time reduction of the income tax rate to
5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

parent. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Corporation
decided to repatriate approximately $1.3 billion of
unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, the Corporation
expects to record a tax provision of approximately
$41 million in the first quarter of 2005. Had the
additional taxes been recorded at the end of 2004, net income
would have been $936 million ($9.93 per share basic and
$9.17 per share diluted). The Corporation is reviewing the
possibility of additional repatriations during 2005. The maximum
additional amount eligible for repatriation under the Act is
approximately $600 million. The Corporation estimates that
an additional tax provision of up to $32 million would be
recorded, depending on the incremental amount distributed, if
any. If the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, in excess of the
amounts eligible for repatriation under the Act were not
indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
approximately $230 million would be required, assuming
utilization of available foreign tax credits.

For income tax reporting at December 31, 2004, the
Corporation has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $128 million, which can be carried forward
indefinitely. The Corporation also has approximately
$40 million of general business credits. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has net operating loss
carryforwards in the United States of approximately
$1.9 billion, substantially all of which expire in 2022
through 2024. At December 31, 2004, a Virgin Islands net
operating loss carryforward of approximately $190 million,
which expires in 2017 through 2022, is also available to offset
the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA joint venture income and
to reduce taxes on interest income from the PDVSA note. In
addition, a foreign exploration and production subsidiary has a
net operating loss carryforward of approximately
$670 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2004, 2003 and 2002
amounted to $632 million, $361 million and
$410 million, respectively.

Earnings per share are as follows:

In 2003, the Corporation issued 13,500,000 shares of 7%
cumulative mandatory convertible preferred stock. Dividends are
payable on March 1, June 1, September 1 and
December 1 of each year. The cumulative mandatory
convertible preferred shares have a liquidation preference of
$675 million ($50 per share). Each cumulative
mandatory convertible preferred share will automatically convert
on December 1, 2006 into .8305 to 1.0299 shares of
common stock, depending on the average closing price of the
Corporation’s common stock over a 20-day period before
conversion. The Corporation has reserved 13,903,650 shares
of common stock for the conversion of these preferred shares.
Holders of the cumulative mandatory convertible preferred stock
have the right to convert their shares at any time prior to
December 1, 2006 at the rate of .8305 share of common
stock for each preferred share converted. The cumulative
mandatory convertible preferred shares do not have voting
rights, except in certain limited circumstances.

Financial Instruments, Non-trading and Trading Activities

Non-Trading:

FAS No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, requires
that the Corporation recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for using
derivatives as hedges. The Corporation reclassifies hedging
gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to
earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized.
Hedging decreased exploration and production results by
$935 million before income taxes in 2004 and
$418 million in 2003. Hedging increased exploration and
production results before income taxes by $82 million in
2002. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness reflected in income
was not material during the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002. The pre-tax amount of all deferred hedge losses
is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax
benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance
sheet.

The Corporation produced 90 million barrels of crude oil
and natural gas liquids and 210 million Mcf of natural gas
in 2004. The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas
hedging activities included commodity futures and swap
contracts. At December 31, 2004, crude oil hedges maturing
in 2005 cover 52 million barrels of crude oil production
(93 million barrels of crude oil at December 31,
2003). The Corporation also has hedged approximately
9 million barrels per year of Brent related production from
2006 through 2012. The Corporation has no natural gas hedges at
December 31, 2004 (18 million Mcf of natural gas at
December 31, 2003). At December 31, 2004, net after
tax deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income
from the Corporation’s crude oil hedging contracts were
$875 million ($1,374 million before income taxes),
including $195 million of realized losses and
$680 million of unrealized losses. Realized losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on
closed contracts that are deferred until the underlying barrels
are sold. Approximately $52 million of the realized loss
will reduce earnings in the first quarter of 2005 and the
remainder will reduce earnings during the balance of 2005. Of
the net after-tax deferred loss, $493 million matures
during 2005. At December 31, 2003, net after-tax deferred
losses were $229 million ($352 million before income
taxes), including $196 million of unrealized losses.

Commodity Trading:

The Corporation, principally
through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities,
including futures, forwards, options, swaps and energy commodity
linked securities, based on expectations of future market
conditions. The Corporation’s income before income taxes
from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of
the trading partnership amounted to $72 million in 2004,
$30 million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002.

Other Financial Instruments:

Foreign currency
contracts are used to protect the Corporation from fluctuations
in exchange rates. The Corporation enters into foreign currency
contracts, which are not designated as hedges, and the change in
fair value is included in income currently. The Corporation has
$476 million of notional value foreign currency forward
contracts maturing in 2005 ($384 million at
December 31, 2003). Notional amounts do not quantify risk
or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are
used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts.
The fair values of the



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

foreign currency forward contracts recorded by the Corporation
were receivables of $49 million at December 31, 2004
and $40 million at December 31, 2003.

The Corporation also has $1,487 million in letters of
credit outstanding at December 31, 2004 ($229 million
at December 31, 2003). Of the total letters of credit
outstanding at December 31, 2004, $72 million relates
to contingent liabilities; the remaining $1,415 million
relates to liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.

Fair Value Disclosure:

The Corporation estimates
the fair value of its fixed-rate notes receivable and debt
generally using discounted cash flow analysis based on current
interest rates for instruments with similar maturities. Foreign
currency exchange contracts are valued based on current
termination values or quoted market prices of comparable
contracts. The Corporation’s valuation of commodity
contracts considers quoted market prices where applicable. In
the absence of quoted market prices, the Corporation values
contracts at fair value considering time value, volatility of
the underlying commodities and other factors.

The following table presents the year-end fair values of energy
commodities and derivative financial instruments used in
non-trading and trading activities:

The carrying amounts of the Corporation’s financial
instruments and commodity contracts, including those used in the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, generally
approximate their fair values at December 31, 2004 and
2003, except as follows:

Credit Risks:

The Corporation’s financial
instruments expose it to credit risks and may at times be
concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is
subject to continuing review and full performance is
anticipated. The Corporation reduces its risk related to certain
counterparties by using master netting agreements and requiring
collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.

In its trading activities the Corporation has net receivables of
$380 million at December 31, 2004, which are
concentrated with counterparties as follows: domestic and
foreign trading companies — 52%, banks and major
financial institutions — 25%, gas and power
companies — 10% and integrated energy
companies — 6%.

Guarantees and Contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Corporation provides
guarantees for investees of the Corporation. These guarantees
are contingent commitments that ensure performance for repayment
of borrowings and other arrangements. The Corporation’s
guarantees include $40 million of HOVENSA’s senior
debt obligation and $97 million of HOVENSA’s crude oil
purchases (see Note 5). The remainder relates principally
to loan guarantees, $55 million for a natural gas pipeline
in which the Corporation owns a 5% interest and $45 million
for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36%
interest. The guarantee of the natural gas pipeline debt
declines over its term. The guarantee of the crude oil pipeline
will be in place through the end of pipeline construction, which
the Corporation expects to be in 2005. In addition, the
Corporation has $72 million in letters of credit for which
it is contingently liable. The maximum potential amount of
future payments that the Corporation could be required to make
under its guarantees at December 31, 2004 is
$309 million ($233 million at December 31, 2003).

The Corporation is also subject to contingent liabilities with
respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings. The Corporation considers these routine and
incidental to its business and not material to its financial
position or results of operations. The Corporation accrues
liabilities when the future costs are probable and reasonably
estimable.

Segment Information

The Corporation has two operating segments that comprise the
structure used by senior management to make key operating
decisions and assess performance. These are (1) exploration
and production and (2) refining and marketing. Operating
segments have not been aggregated. Exploration and production
operations include the exploration for and the production,
purchase, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas.
Refining and marketing operations include the manufacture,
purchase, transportation, trading and marketing of petroleum and
other energy products.

, and includes (1) costs incurred,
capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and
gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas
reserves, and (3) a standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves,
including a reconciliation of changes therein.

The Corporation produces crude oil and/or natural gas in the
United States, Europe, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Gabon,
Indonesia, Thailand and Azerbaijan. Exploration activities are
also conducted, or are planned, in additional countries.

During 2004, the development plan for the Okume Complex was
approved by the government of Equatorial Guinea and most of the
major contracts for construction were authorized. Production is
expected to commence in 2007. Additional gas sales were
negotiated covering Block A-18 in the joint development area of
Malaysia and Thailand (JDA). First production from the JDA
commenced in 2005 under the original gas sales contract. During
2004, the Ujung Pangkah gas sales agreement was approved.

During 2003, the Corporation exchanged its interests in
producing oil and gas fields in the United Kingdom for an
increased interest in a Gulf of Mexico field. The Corporation
sold producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the
Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom
fields. The Corporation also exchanged producing properties in
Colombia for an additional 25% interest in the JDA. Because of
this exchange, the Corporation has consolidated its oil and gas
interests in the JDA. In 2003, the Corporation also exchanged
its 25% equity investment in Premier Oil plc for an interest in
a producing field in Indonesia.

Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Producing Activities

The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities

sales of oil and gas properties), interest expense and gains and
losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions. Therefore,
these results are on a different basis than the net income from
exploration and production operations reported in
management’s discussion and analysis of results of
operations and in Note 17 to the financial statements.

Includes accrued severance and costs for vacated office space
    of approximately $15 million and $40 million in 2004
    and 2003, respectively.



Oil and Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
producible; government approvals must be obtained and depending
on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the
board of directors must commit to fund the project. The
Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting
process involves an annual independent third party reserve
determination as well as internal technical appraisals of
reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the
estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported below are determined
independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton
(D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually,
the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological
and geophysical data, actual production histories and other
information necessary for the reserve determination. The
Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to
review and discuss the information provided. Senior management
and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates
issued by D&M.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying year-end oil
and gas selling prices (adjusted for price changes provided by
contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of
proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development
and production costs, which are based on year-end costs and
existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are
computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax
rates to the pre-tax net cash flows relating to the
Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash
flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The
discounted future net cash flow estimates required by
FAS No. 69 do not include exploration expenses,
interest expense or corporate general and administrative
expenses. The selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are
highly volatile. The year-end prices, which are required to be
used for the discounted future net cash flows and do not include
the effects of hedges, may not be representative of future
selling prices. The future net cash flow estimates could be
materially different if other assumptions were used.

Principal Accounting Fees and Services

Information relating to this item is incorporated by reference
to “Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors”
from the Registrant’s definitive proxy statement for the
annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 4, 2005.

Ernst & Young LLP (EY), the Corporation’s
independent auditor, recently informed the Corporation and the
Corporation’s Audit Committee that certain non-audit work
has raised questions regarding EY’s independence. An
affiliate of EY in Indonesia held de minimis tax-related funds
and made payment of such



funds to taxing authorities in connection with tax compliance
services provided by EY to certain expatriate employees of the
Corporation. The amount of funds handled by EY over the
three-year period was approximately $3,500. The services
provided by the EY affiliate have been discontinued. Custody of
the assets of an audit client is not permitted under the auditor
independence rules in Regulation S-X of the Securities
Exchange Commission.

The Corporation’s Audit Committee and EY have considered
the impact that these actions may have on EY’s independence
with respect to the Corporation and have concluded that there
has been no impairment of EY’s independence. In making this
determination, the Audit Committee considered the de minimis
amount of the funds involved and the ministerial nature of the
actions. In addition, the Corporation’s subsidiary involved
is not material to the Corporation’s consolidated financial
statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Executive Committee and Members

HOVENSA L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of
HOVENSA L.L.C. (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of
income and retained earnings, cash flows and comprehensive
income (loss) for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of HOVENSA L.L.C. at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Note 1:

Basis of Financial Statements and Significant Accounting
    Policies

Nature of Business:

HOVENSA L.L.C. (Company) was
formed as a joint venture between Petroleos de
Venezuela, SA. (PDVSA) and Amerada Hess Corporation
(AHC) to own and operate the Company’s refinery. The
Company purchases crude oil from PDVSA, AHC and third parties.
It manufactures and sells petroleum products primarily to PDVSA
and AHC. In preparing financial statements, management makes
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and
expenses in the statement of income. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Estimates made by management include:
inventory and other asset valuations, environmental obligations,
depreciable lives and turnaround accruals.

The Company is jointly owned by PDVSA V.I., Inc.
(PDVSA V.I.), a subsidiary of PDVSA, and Hess Oil Virgin
Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a subsidiary of AHC.

A summary of all material transactions between the Company, its
members and affiliates follows:

The Company has a product sales agreement with AHC and Petroleum
Marketing International (Petromar), a subsidiary of PDVSA. After
any sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third parties,
Petromar and AHC each must purchase 50% of HOVENSA’s
gasoline, distillate, residual fuel and other products at market
prices. The Company also has long-term crude oil supply
agreements with Petromar, by which Petromar agrees to sell to
HOVENSA a monthly average of 155,000 barrels per day of
Mesa crude oil and 115,000 barrels per day of Merey crude
oil.

PDVSA and AHC each guarantee the payment of up to 50% of the
value of the crude oil purchases from third parties. In
addition, PDVSA and AHC have agreed to provide funding
(50% each) to the extent that the Company does not have
funds to meet its senior debt obligations up to
$40,000 each, until completion of construction required to
meet final low sulfur fuel regulations, after which the amount
becomes $15,000 each.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of
highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into
cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired.

Short Term Investments:

Instruments with an original
maturity to the Company of over 90 days. At
December 31, 2004 this balance was $38,841. The Company
intends and has the ability to hold these investments to
maturity.

Debt Service Reserve Fund:

Cash held by the Trustee for
debt service that is not available for general corporate
purposes.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars)

Inventories:

Inventories of crude oil and refined
products are valued at the lower of last-in, first-out
(LIFO) cost or market. During 2004 and 2003, a reduction of
inventory quantities in a LIFO pool resulted in a liquidation of
LIFO inventories carried at below market costs, which increased
net income by approximately $600 and $9,000, respectively. At
December 31, 2004, LIFO inventory cost was $331,967 lower
than it would have been using the average cost method.

Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at the lower of
average cost or market.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenues from
the sale of petroleum products when title passes to the customer.

Depreciation:

Depreciation of refinery facilities is
determined principally on the units-of-production method based
on estimated production volumes. Depreciation of all other
equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on
estimated useful lives.

Maintenance and Repairs:

The estimated cost of major
maintenance (turnarounds) is accrued. Other expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged against income as
incurred. Renewals and improvements are treated as additions to
property, plant and equipment, and items replaced are treated as
retirements.

Environmental Policy:

The Company capitalizes
environmental expenditures that increase the life of property or
that reduce or prevent environmental contamination. The Company
accrues environmental expenses resulting from existing
conditions that relate to past operations when the future costs
are probable and reasonably estimable.

Income Taxes:

The Company is a limited liability company
and, as a result, income taxes are the responsibility of the
members.

Interest Hedges:

In 2001, under the terms of its bank
credit agreement, the Company was required to use interest rate
collars to reduce the effects of fluctuations in interest
expense related to long-term debt. These derivatives were
designated as hedges of future cash flow (cash flow hedges) and
the gains or losses were recorded in other comprehensive income
until the related transactions were expensed in 2002. The
company’s obligation to maintain these hedges was completed
in 2002.

The Company retired the existing term loan facility and the
$150,000 general purpose revolver on November 12, 2004.
Another general purpose revolver was established on the same day
for $400,000, expiring in November 2008. This new facility
remained undrawn at December 31, 2004. Borrowings under
this agreement currently would bear interest at 2.5% above the
London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of .625% per annum
is payable on the undrawn portion of the credit line. The
interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the
Company’s credit rating changes. The agreement is
collateralized by the physical assets and certain material
contracts of the Company.

In November 2002, the Company issued $126,753 of Senior Secured
Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Government
of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Virgin Islands Public
Finance Authority. The principal payments on the Bonds commence
in 2014 and will be fully paid by July 1, 2021.

In December 2003, the Company issued $74,175 of Senior Secured
Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Virgin
Islands Public Finance Authority. The principal payments on the
Bonds commence in 2015 and will be fully paid by July 1,
2022. The proceeds from this issue were used to pre-pay
principal installments under the bank term loan facility.

In April 2004, the Company issued $50,660 of Senior Secured
Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Virgin
Islands Public Finance Authority. The principal payments on the
Bonds commence in

2015 and will be fully paid by July 1, 2022. The proceeds
from this issue were used to pre-pay principal installments
under the bank term loan facility.

The debt agreements contain various restrictions and conditions
with respect to incurrence of additional debt as well as cash
distributions. Cash distributions are restricted based on cash
flow coverage ratio covenants until such time as the Company
completes the construction required to meet final low sulfur
fuel regulations.

The Company capitalized interest of $2,958 in 2004 and $18,901
in 2002. The interest paid (net of amounts capitalized) was
$18,757 in 2004, $24,584 in 2003 and $8,619 in 2002.

Note 5:

Pension Plan

The Company has a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan
for substantially all of its employees. The plan provides
defined benefits based on years of service and final average
salary. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement
date for its plan.

The following table reconciles the benefit obligation and fair
value of plan assets and shows the funded status of the pension
plan:

The accumulated benefit obligation was $22,784 at
December 31, 2004 and $17,309 at December 31, 2003.

The pension plan’s assumed long-term rate of return is
consistent with the long-term rate of return on plan assets of
Amerada Hess Corporation’s plan with a similar asset
allocation. The member’s long-term rate of return is based
on historical long-term returns, adjusted slightly to reflect
lower prevailing interest rates. Effective January 1, 2005,
the Company lowered the assumed long-term rate of return on plan
assets to 7.5%.

The Company’s pension plan assets by category are as
follows:

Asset Category



Equity securities

Debt securities



Total

The target investment allocations for the plan assets are
55% equity securities and 45% debt securities. Asset
allocations are rebalanced on a regular basis throughout the
year to bring assets to within 2-3% range of target levels.
Target allocations take into account analyses performed by the
Company’s pension consultant to optimize long term risk/
return relationships. All assets are highly liquid and may be
readily adjusted to provide liquidity for current benefit
payment requirements.

The Company expects to contribute approximately $4,000 to its
pension plan in 2005.

Note 6:

Interest Hedges

The Company used interest rate collars to reduce the effects of
fluctuations in interest expense related to long-term debt. The
interest rate collars and the hedged transactions matured in
2002. These interest rate collars were designated as hedges of
expected future cash flows (cash flow hedges), and the losses
were recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged
interest was recognized. At December 31, 2001, deferred
losses from interest hedging were $6,955.

The Company reclassified hedging gains and losses on interest
rate collars from accumulated other comprehensive income to
interest expense (portions of which were capitalized) over the
period hedged. Hedging increased interest expense in 2002 by
$6,955. The ineffective portion of hedges was included in
earnings. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not material.

Note 7:

Environmental Requirements

In December 1999, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) adopted rules that phase in limitations on the
sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2004. In December 2000,
the EPA adopted regulations to reduce substantially the
allowable sulfur content of diesel fuel by 2006. The EPA is also
considering restriction or a prohibition on the use of MTBE (New
York and Connecticut have banned it effective January 1,
2004), a gasoline additive that the Company produces and uses to
meet United States regulations requiring oxygenation of
reformulated gasoline.

The Company is reviewing options to determine the most cost
effective compliance strategies for these new fuel regulations.
The costs to comply will depend on a variety of factors,
including the availability of suitable technology and
contractors and whether the minimum oxygen content requirement
for reformulated gasoline remains in place if MTBE is banned.
Capital expenditures necessary to comply with the low sulfur
gasoline and diesel fuel requirements are estimated to be
$400,000 (including approximately $50,000 already spent).
Remaining capital expenditures are expected to be $350,000 over
the next two years.

Note 8:

Contingencies

The Company is party to litigation arising out of the normal
course of its business. In the opinion of management, all
matters are adequately covered by insurance or reserves or, if
not covered or reserved for, are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.
