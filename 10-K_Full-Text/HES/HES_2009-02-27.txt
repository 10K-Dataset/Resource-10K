Business and Properties

Hess Corporation (the Registrant) is a Delaware corporation,
    incorporated in 1920. The Registrant and its subsidiaries
    (collectively referred to as the Corporation or Hess) is a
    global integrated energy company that operates in two segments,
    Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining
    (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops,
    produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural
    gas. These exploration and production activities take place
    principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark,
    Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya,
    Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and
    the United States. The M&R segment manufactures, purchases,
    transports, trades and markets refined petroleum products,
    natural gas and electricity. The Corporation owns 50% of a
    refinery joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands, and
    another refining facility, terminals and retail gasoline
    stations, most of which include convenience stores, located on
    the East Coast of the United States.

The Corporation presently estimates that its 2009 production
    will be approximately 380,000 to 390,000 barrels of oil
    equivalent per day (boepd).

A description of our significant E&P operations follows:

United
    States

At December 31, 2008, 19% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in the United States. During 2008,
    16% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids
    production and 11% of its natural gas production were from
    United States operations. The Corporation’s production in
    the United States was principally from properties offshore in
    the Gulf of Mexico, which include the Llano (Hess 50%), Conger
    (Hess 38%), Baldpate (Hess 50%), Hack Wilson (Hess 25%) and Penn
    State (Hess 50%) fields, as well as onshore properties in North
    Dakota and in the Permian Basin of Texas.

In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, development of the Shenzi Field
    (Hess 28%) progressed in 2008. Tension leg platform tendons,
    hull and topsides were installed and flowlines were laid and
    tested. First production is expected in the second quarter of
    2009.

In the Williston Basin of North Dakota, the Corporation holds a
    net acreage position in the Bakken Play of approximately
    570,000 acres. In 2009, the Corporation plans to drill
    additional production wells and expand production facilities.

The Corporation is developing a residual oil zone at the
    Seminole-San Andres Unit (Hess 34%) in Texas where carbon
    dioxide gas supplied from its interests in the West Bravo Dome
    and Bravo Dome fields in New Mexico will be injected to enhance
    recovery of crude oil.

In the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%)
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation successfully
    completed drilling an appraisal well in June 2008. The
    Corporation is evaluating development options for Pony.

At the Corporation’s Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%)
    located in the Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico, a third well was successfully drilled during 2008. The
    operator is evaluating development options for Tubular Bells.

At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had interests in more
    than 400 exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, which
    included 1,442,020 net undeveloped acres.

Europe

At December 31, 2008, 31% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in Europe (United Kingdom 9%,
    Norway 13%, Denmark 3% and Russia 6%). During 2008, 33% of the
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
    and 37% of its natural gas production were from European
    operations.

United Kingdom:

Production of crude oil
    and natural gas liquids from the United Kingdom North Sea was
    principally from the Corporation’s non-operated interests
    in Nevis (Hess 39%), Schiehallion (Hess 16%), Clair (Hess 9%),
    Bittern (Hess 28%) and Beryl (Hess 22%) fields. Natural gas
    production from the United Kingdom was primarily from the
    Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%), Easington Catchment
    Area (Hess 32%), Bacton area (Hess 23%), Beryl (Hess 22%),
    Everest (Hess 19%), Lomond (Hess 17%) and Nevis (Hess 39%)
    fields.

Norway:

Substantially all of the 2008
    and 2007 Norwegian production was from the Corporation’s
    interest in the Valhall Field (Hess 28%). A field redevelopment
    for Valhall commenced in 2008 and is expected to be completed in
    2010. The Corporation also holds an interest in the Snohvit
    Field (Hess 3%) located offshore Norway.

Denmark:

Crude oil and natural gas
    production comes from the Corporation’s interest in the
    South Arne Field (Hess 58%).

Russia:

The Corporation’s
    activities in Russia are conducted through its 80%-owned
    interest in a corporate joint venture operating in the
    Volga-Urals region of Russia.



Africa

At December 31, 2008, 23% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in Africa (Equatorial Guinea 8%,
    Algeria 4%, Libya 10% and Gabon 1%). During 2008, 46% of the
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
    was from African operations.

Equatorial Guinea:

The Corporation is
    the operator and owns an interest in Block G (Hess 85%) which
    contains the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex.

Algeria:

The Corporation has a 49%
    interest in a venture with the Algerian national oil company
    that is redeveloping three oil fields.

Libya:

The Corporation, in conjunction
    with its Oasis Group partners, has oil and gas production
    operations in the Waha concessions in Libya (Hess 8%). The
    Corporation also owns a 100% interest in offshore exploration
    Area 54, where a successful exploration well was drilled in
    2008. The Corporation intends to obtain 3D seismic in
    Area 54 and further drilling is planned.

Gabon:

The Corporation’s
    activities in Gabon are conducted through its Gabonese
    subsidiary, where the Corporation has interests in the Rabi
    Kounga, Toucan and Atora fields. In the third quarter of 2008,
    the Corporation acquired the remaining 22.5% interest in the
    Gabonese subsidiary.

Egypt:

The Corporation has a

25-year

development lease for the West Mediterranean Block 1
    concession (West Med Block) (Hess 55%), which contains four
    existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
    opportunities. During 2008, the Corporation drilled a successful
    exploration well on the block, which encountered natural gas and
    crude oil. The Corporation is currently conducting engineering
    studies and further exploratory drilling is planned.

Ghana:

The Corporation holds a 100%
    interest in the Cape Three Points South Block located offshore
    Ghana. The Corporation is currently acquiring new 3D seismic in
    the unexplored western half of the license area.

Asia and
    Other

At December 31, 2008, 27% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in the Asia and other region (JDA
    13%, Indonesia 9%, Thailand 3% and Azerbaijan 2%). During 2008,
    5% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids
    production and 52% of its natural gas production were from Asia
    and other operations.

Joint Development Area of Malaysia and
    Thailand:

The Corporation owns an interest in
    Block

A-18

of the JDA (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand. Phase 2 gas
    sales commenced in November of 2008 upon commissioning of a
    third-party gas export pipeline to Thailand.

Indonesia:

The Corporation’s
    natural gas production in Indonesia primarily comes from its
    interests offshore in the Ujung Pangkah project (Hess 75%),
    which commenced in 2007, and the Natuna A Field (Hess 23%).
    Additional production from a Phase 2 oil project at Ujung
    Pangkah is expected in mid 2009. The Corporation also owns an
    interest in the onshore Jambi Merang natural gas project (Hess
    25%), which was sanctioned for development in 2007. In the
    fourth quarter of 2008, the Corporation acquired a 100% working
    interest in the offshore Semai V exploration block.

Thailand:

The Corporation’s
    natural gas production in Thailand primarily comes from the
    offshore Pailin Field (Hess 15%) and the onshore Sinphuhorm
    Block (Hess 35%).

Azerbaijan:

The Corporation has an
    interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) fields (Hess 3%) in
    the Caspian Sea. The Corporation also holds an interest in the
    Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline (Hess 2%).

Australia:

The Corporation holds a 100%
    interest in an exploration license covering 780,000 acres
    in the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia
    (WA-Block 390-P). During 2008, the Corporation completed
    drilling its initial four exploration wells of a 16 well
    commitment on the block. Three of the four wells discovered
    natural gas and the Corporation plans to drill five additional
    exploration wells in 2009. The Corporation also holds a 50%
    interest in

WA-Block 404-P

located offshore Western Australia, which covers a total area of
    680,000 acres. The operator plans to drill three wells on
    this block in 2009.



Brazil:

The Corporation has interests
    in two blocks located offshore Brazil, the

BM-S-22

Block (Hess 40%) in the Santos Basin and the

BM-ES-30

Block (Hess 60%) in the Espirito Santo Basin. The operator
    commenced drilling of the Azulao exploration well on

BM-S-22

in
    2008 and filed a Notice of Discovery with the regulators on
    January 16, 2009. The operator plans to drill another well
    on

BM-S-22

in 2009.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas reserves at the
    end of 2008, 2007 and 2006 are presented under Supplementary Oil
    and Gas Data on pages 75 through 81 in the accompanying
    financial statements.

During 2008, the Corporation provided oil and gas reserve
    estimates for 2007 to the United States Department of Energy.
    Such estimates are consistent with the information furnished to
    the SEC on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2007, although not
    necessarily directly comparable due to the requirements of the
    individual requests. There were no differences in excess of 5%.

Sales commitments:

The Corporation has
    no contracts or agreements to sell fixed quantities of its crude
    oil production. In the United States, natural gas is marketed by
    the M&R segment on a spot basis and under contracts for
    varying periods to local distribution companies, and commercial,
    industrial and other purchasers. The Corporation’s United
    States natural gas production is expected to approximate 20% of
    its 2009 sales commitments under long-term contracts. The
    Corporation attempts to minimize supply risks associated with
    its United States natural gas supply commitments by entering
    into purchase contracts with third parties having reliable
    sources of supply, on terms substantially similar to those under
    its commitments and by leasing storage facilities.

Outside of the United States, the Corporation generally sells
    its natural gas production under long-term sales contracts at
    prices that are periodically adjusted due to changes in
    commodity prices or other indices. In the United Kingdom, the
    Corporation sells the majority of its natural gas production on
    a spot basis.

Of total refined products sold
    in 2008, 2007 and 2006 approximately 50% was obtained from
    HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation purchased the balance
    from third parties under short-term supply contracts and spot
    purchases.

Refining

The Corporation owns a 50% interest in HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA),
    a refining joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands
    with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In
    addition, it owns and operates a refining facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey.

HOVENSA:

Refining operations at HOVENSA
    consist of crude units, a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a
    delayed coker unit.

The following table summarizes capacity and utilization rates
    for HOVENSA:

The delayed coker unit permits HOVENSA to run lower-cost heavy
    crude oil. HOVENSA has a long-term supply contract with PDVSA to
    purchase 115,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy
    crude oil. PDVSA also supplies 155,000 barrels per day of
    Venezuelan Mesa medium gravity crude oil to HOVENSA under a
    long-term crude oil supply contract. The remaining crude oil
    requirements are purchased mainly under contracts of one year or
    less from third parties and through spot purchases on the open
    market. After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third
    parties, the Corporation purchases 50% of HOVENSA’s
    remaining production at market prices.

Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 441,000 barrels per
    day in 2008 compared with 454,000 barrels per day in 2007
    and 448,000 barrels per day in 2006. The 2008 utilization
    rate for the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA reflects
    lower utilization due to weak refining margins, planned and
    unplanned maintenance of certain units, and a refinery wide shut
    down for Hurricane Omar. During the second quarter of 2007, the
    coker unit at HOVENSA was shut down for approximately
    30 days for a scheduled turnaround. The fluid catalytic
    cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for approximately
    22 days of unplanned maintenance in 2006.

Port Reading Facility:

The Corporation
    owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey, with a capacity of 70,000 barrels per
    day. This facility, which processes residual fuel oil and vacuum
    gas oil, operated at a rate of approximately 64,000 barrels
    per day in 2008 compared with 61,000 barrels per day in
    2007 and 63,000 barrels per day in 2006. Substantially all
    of Port Reading’s production is gasoline and heating oil.



Marketing

The Corporation markets refined petroleum products, natural gas
    and electricity on the East Coast of the United States to the
    motoring public, wholesale distributors, industrial and
    commercial users, other petroleum companies, governmental
    agencies and public utilities.

The Corporation had 1,366
    HESS

®

gasoline stations at December 31, 2008, including stations
    owned by its WilcoHess joint venture (Hess 44%). Approximately
    90% of the gasoline stations are operated by the Corporation or
    WilcoHess. Of the operated stations, 93% have convenience stores
    on the sites. Most of the Corporation’s gasoline stations
    are in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida,
    Massachusetts, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Refined product sales averaged 472,000 barrels per day in
    2008 compared with 451,000 barrels per day in 2007 and
    459,000 barrels in 2006. Total energy marketing natural gas
    sales volumes, including utility and spot sales, were
    approximately 2.0 million mcf per day in 2008,
    1.9 million mcf per day in 2007 and 1.8 million mcf
    per day in 2006. In addition, energy marketing sold electricity
    volumes at the rate of 3,200, 2,800 and 1,400 megawatts (round
    the clock) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases
    reflect the impact of acquisitions and organic growth.

The Corporation owns 21 terminals with an aggregate storage
    capacity of 22 million barrels in its East Coast marketing
    areas. The Corporation also owns a terminal in St. Lucia with a
    storage capacity of 10 million barrels, which is operated
    for third party storage.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
    Corporation also takes energy commodity and derivative trading
    positions for its own account.

The Corporation also has a 92.5% interest in Hess LNG, which is
    pursuing investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals
    and related supply, trading and marketing opportunities. The
    joint venture is pursuing the development of LNG terminal
    projects located in Fall River, Massachusetts and Shannon,
    Ireland. In addition, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Corporation is exploring the development of fuel cell technology.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors Related to Our Business and Operations

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant risk factors, including those described
    below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect
    our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of
    operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our
    securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is
    possible additional risks relating to our securities may be
    described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in
    the future.

Commodity Price Risk:

Our estimated proved
    reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins,
    future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on
    the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum
    products, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our
    control. Historically these prices have been very volatile and
    most recently have been adversely affected by falling demand
    caused by the global economic downturn. The major foreign oil
    producing countries, including members of the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert considerable
    influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined
    petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a
    common policy on rates of production and other matters has a
    significant impact on the oil markets. The commodities trading
    markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil,
    natural gas and refined petroleum products. If crude oil and
    natural gas prices remain at year-end 2008 levels, our revenues,
    profitability and cash flow will be lower in 2009 compared with
    2008. In addition, if crude oil and natural gas prices decline
    further from year-end 2008 levels, it could result in a
    reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets,
    proved oil and gas reserves, deferred tax assets and goodwill.
    To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate
    commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of
    price increases above the hedged price. Changes in commodity
    prices can also have a material impact on margin requirements
    under our derivative contracts.

Technical Risk:

We own or have access to a
    finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted
    over time. Replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to
    successful exploration drilling, development activities, and
    enhanced recovery programs. Reserve replacement can also be
    achieved through acquisition. Therefore, future oil and gas
    production is dependent on technical success in finding and
    developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity
    involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and
    geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the
    presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling
    risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in
    pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather
    interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen
    reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or
    flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities
    have increased in recent years which could negatively affect
    expected economic returns. Although due diligence is used in
    evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar
    uncertainties may be encountered in the production of oil and
    gas on properties acquired from others.

Oil and Gas Reserves and Discounted Future Net Cash Flow
    Risks:

Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities
    of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves.
    Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes,
    capital expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and
    quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary
    substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could
    materially affect the estimated quantities and future net
    revenues of our proved reserves. In addition, reserve estimates
    may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on
    production performance, purchases or sales of properties,
    results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices,
    production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as
    crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors.

Political Risk:

Federal, state, local,
    territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax
    increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation or
    nationalization of property, mandatory government participation,
    cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in
    import regulations, limitations on access to exploration and
    development opportunities, as well as other political
    developments may affect our operations. Some of the
    international areas in which we operate are politically less
    stable than our domestic operations. In addition, the threat of
    terrorism around the world poses additional risks to the
    operations of the oil and gas industry. In our M&R segment,
    we market motor fuels through lessee-dealers and wholesalers in
    certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners
    of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor
    fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the
    U.S. Congress and in various other states.



Environmental Risk:

Our oil and gas
    operations, like those of the industry, are subject to
    environmental risk such as oil spills, produced water spills,
    gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases
    that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or
    other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to
    numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign
    environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these
    laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or
    criminal penalties, remedial

clean-ups

and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition,
    increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly
    relating to the production of motor and other fuels and the
    potential for controls on greenhouse gas emissions, have
    resulted, and will likely continue to result, in higher capital
    expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas
    industry in general.

Competitive Risk:

The petroleum industry is
    highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter
    competition from numerous companies in each of our activities,
    including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural
    gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined products and
    natural gas. Many competitors, including national oil companies,
    are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also
    in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of
    energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets
    has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In
    addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise
    and equipment has affected the availability of technical
    personnel and drilling rigs and has increased capital and
    operating costs.

Catastrophic Risk:

Although we maintain a
    level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices
    against property and casualty losses, our oil and gas operations
    are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or
    destroy assets or interrupt operations. Examples of catastrophic
    risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts. These
    occurrences have affected us from time to time. During 2008, our
    annual Gulf of Mexico production of crude oil and natural gas
    was reduced by an estimated 7,000 boepd due to the impact of
    Hurricanes Ike and Gustav.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Registrant, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving
    water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in
    jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE
    and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE,
    including the Registrant. While the majority of the cases were
    settled in 2008, the Registrant remains a defendant in
    approximately 20 cases. These cases have been consolidated for
    pre-trial purposes in the Southern District of New York as part
    of a multi-district litigation proceeding, with the exception of
    an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire.
    The principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline
    containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties
    are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline
    market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to
    take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the
    environment of releases of MTBE. The damages claimed in these
    actions are substantial and in almost all cases, punitive
    damages are also sought. In the fourth quarter 2007, the
    Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of $40 million
    related to MTBE litigation, including amounts for the cases
    settled in 2008.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries
    covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on
    the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of
    the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has
    previously installed more advanced pollution controls. EPA
    initially contacted Registrant and HOVENSA regarding the
    Petroleum Refinery Initiative in August 2003. Negotiations with
    EPA and the relevant states and the Virgin Islands are
    continuing and substantial progress has been made toward
    resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA.
    While



the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining
    Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is
    reached and entered by a court, additional future capital
    expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over
    a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not
    expected to be material to the Corporation.

On September 13, 2007, HOVENSA received a Notice Of
    Violation (NOV) pursuant to section 113(a)(i) of the Clean
    Air Act (Act) from the EPA finding that HOVENSA failed to obtain
    proper permitting for the construction and operation of its
    delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and
    regulations. HOVENSA believes it properly obtained all necessary
    permits for this project. The NOV states that EPA has authority
    to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for
    violation of the Act. HOVENSA has entered into discussions with
    the EPA to reach resolution of this matter. Registrant does not
    believe that this matter will result in material liability to
    HOVENSA or Registrant.

In December 2006, HOVENSA received a NOV from the EPA alleging
    non-compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the
    Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources
    (DPNR) for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit.
    The NOV was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and
    submission by HOVENSA regarding potential non-compliance with
    the permit emissions limits for two pollutants. Any exceedances
    were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants
    emitted in excess of the limits. HOVENSA has entered into
    discussions with the appropriate governmental agencies to reach
    resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will
    result in material liability to HOVENSA or the Corporation.

Registrant received a directive from the New Jersey Department
    of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination
    in the sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also
    seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it
    affects Registrant, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum
    bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by the
    Registrant. Registrant and over 70 companies entered into
    an Administrative Order on Consent with EPA to study the same
    contamination. NJDEP has also sued several other companies
    linked to a facility considered by the State to be the largest
    contributor to river contamination. In January 2009, these
    companies added third party defendants, including the
    Registrant, to that case. In June 2007, EPA issued a draft study
    which evaluated six alternatives for early action, with costs
    ranging from $900 million to $2.3 billion. Based on
    adverse comments from Registrant and others, EPA is reevaluating
    its alternatives. In addition, the federal trustees for natural
    resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural
    resources in the Passaic River. Given the ongoing studies,
    remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based
    on currently known facts and circumstances, the Registrant does
    not believe that this matter will result in material liability
    because its terminal could not have contributed contamination
    along most of the river’s length and did not store or use
    contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river
    sediments, and because there are numerous other parties who will
    likely share in the cost of remediation and damages.

In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly
    owned subsidiary of the Registrant, and HOVENSA, each received a
    letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of
    Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees,
    advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit against
    HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
    alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
    damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous
    substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
    currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south
    shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had
    been operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed
    on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands
    against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated
    industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix
    asserting that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and
    territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural
    resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA do not believe that this matter
    will result in a material liability as they believe that they
    have strong defenses to this complaint, and they intend to
    vigorously defend this matter.

The Registrant periodically receives notices from EPA that it is
    a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
    legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
    this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
    jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
    claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation
    relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With
    respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s claims have been
    settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all
    cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of
    these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private
    parties, on the



business or accounts of the Corporation cannot be predicted at
    this time due to the large number of other potentially
    responsible parties and the speculative nature of

clean-up

cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notified the
    Registrant that on July 21, 2005, it commenced a private
    investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial
    Guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of
    the government of Equatorial Guinea. The SEC has requested
    documents and information from the Registrant and other oil and
    gas companies that have operations or interests in Equatorial
    Guinea. Registrant has provided the documents and information
    requested.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
    and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
    to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of
    these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of
    them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such
    proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of
    the SEC. In management’s opinion, based upon currently
    known facts and circumstances, such proceedings in the aggregate
    will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
    condition of the Corporation.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
    operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P)
    and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment
    explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and
    sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment
    manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.

Net income in 2008 was $2,360 million compared with
    $1,832 million in 2007 and $1,920 million in 2006.
    Diluted earnings per share were $7.24 in 2008 compared with
    $5.74 in 2007 and $6.08 in 2006. A table of items affecting
    comparability between periods is shown on page 21.

Exploration
    and Production

The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to
    profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and
    financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were 1,432 million barrels of oil
    equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2008 compared with
    1,330 million boe at December 31, 2007 and
    1,243 million boe at December 31, 2006. Total proved
    reserves at year end 2008 increased 102 million boe or 8%
    from the end of 2007.

E&P net income was $2,423 million in 2008,
    $1,842 million in 2007 and $1,763 million in 2006. The
    improved results in 2008 as compared to 2007 were primarily
    driven by higher average crude oil selling prices. At
    December 31, 2008, crude oil selling prices were
    significantly below the average prices in 2008.

Production averaged 381,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
    day (boepd) in 2008 compared with 377,000 boepd in 2007 and
    359,000 boepd in 2006. Production in 2008 increased
    4,000 boepd or 1% from 2007. In 2009, the Corporation
    currently estimates total worldwide production to be
    approximately 380,000 boepd to 390,000 boepd.

During 2008, the Corporation progressed the following
    development projects that will add to its production in future
    years:

•

In November 2008, upon the commissioning of a third-party gas
    export pipeline to Thailand, Phase 2 gas sales commenced at

Block A-18

of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA)
    (Hess 50%).

•

In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, development of the Shenzi Field
    (Hess 28%) progressed. Tension leg platform tendons, hull and
    topsides were installed and flowlines were laid and tested.
    First production is expected in the second quarter of 2009.

•

Additional production from a Phase 2 oil project at the
    Ujung Pangkah Field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia is expected in mid
    2009.

•

Development of a residual oil zone advanced at the
    Seminole-San Andres Unit (Hess 34%) with the installation
    of facilities and equipment.

During 2008, the Corporation’s exploration activities
    included:

•

In the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%)
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation successfully
    completed drilling an appraisal well. The Corporation is
    evaluating development options for Pony.

•

At the Corporation’s Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%)
    located in the Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico, a third well was successfully drilled during 2008. The
    operator is evaluating development options for Tubular Bells.

•

The Corporation completed drilling its initial four exploration
    wells of a 16 well commitment on the

WA-Block-390-P

offshore Western Australia (Hess 100%). Three of the four wells
    discovered natural gas and the Corporation plans to drill five
    additional exploration wells in 2009. The operator of the

WA-Block 404-P

(Hess 50%) offshore Western Australia plans to drill three
    exploration wells in 2009.



•

The Corporation drilled a successful exploration well in Area 54
    offshore Libya (Hess 100%). The Corporation intends to obtain 3D
    seismic in Area 54 and further drilling is planned.

•

The Corporation drilled a successful exploration well on the
    West Med Block (Hess 55%) in Egypt, which encountered natural
    gas and crude oil. The Corporation is currently conducting
    engineering studies and further exploratory drilling is planned.

•

The operator commenced drilling of an exploration well on the
    BM-S-22 Block (Hess 40%) in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil and
    filed a Notice of Discovery with the regulators on
    January 16, 2009.

•

The Corporation was successful in acquiring new deepwater blocks
    in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico and the offshore Semai
    V exploration block in Indonesia.

Marketing
    and Refining

The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to
    deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash
    flow. M&R net income was $277 million in 2008,
    $300 million in 2007 and $394 million in 2006.
    Earnings in 2008 and 2007 reflect lower average margins compared
    to the prior periods.

Refining operations contributed net income of $73 million
    in 2008, $193 million in 2007 and $240 million in
    2006. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA
    totaling $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and
    $400 million in 2006. Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged
    441,000 barrels per day in 2008 compared with
    454,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 448,000 barrels
    per day in 2006. In 2007, HOVENSA successfully completed the
    first turnaround of its delayed coker unit. The Port Reading
    refinery operated at an average of 64,000 barrels per day
    in 2008 versus 61,000 barrels per day in 2007 and
    63,000 barrels per day in 2006. Marketing earnings were
    $240 million in 2008, $83 million in 2007 and
    $108 million in 2006. Total refined product sales volumes
    averaged 472,000 barrels per day in 2008 compared with
    451,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 459,000 barrels
    per day in 2006.

Liquidity
    and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $4,567 million in 2008, $3,507 million in 2007 and
    $3,491 million in 2006, principally reflecting increased
    earnings. At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents
    totaled $908 million compared with $607 million at
    December 31, 2007. Total debt was $3,955 million at
    December 31, 2008 compared with $3,980 million at
    December 31, 2007. The Corporation’s debt to
    capitalization ratio at December 31, 2008 was 24.3%
    compared with 28.9% at the end of 2007. The Corporation has debt
    maturities of $143 million in 2009 and $31 million in
    2010. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million
    of 5 year notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of
    10 year notes with a coupon of 8.125%.

Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the

In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
    transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
    reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
    after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
    earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
    preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
    they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
    the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
    the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of
    income (expense) that are included in net income and affect
    comparability between periods. The items in the table below are
    explained, and the pre-tax amounts are shown, on pages 25
    through 27.

Amounts differ from E&P
    operating revenues in Note 17 “Segment
    Information” primarily due to the exclusion of sales of
    hydrocarbons purchased from third parties.

After considering the Exploration and Production items in the
    table on page 21, the remaining changes in Exploration and
    Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in
    selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration
    expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below.

Selling prices:

Higher average selling
    prices increased Exploration and Production revenues by
    approximately $2,100 million in 2008 compared with 2007. At
    December 31, 2008, the selling prices of crude oil and
    natural gas had decreased significantly from the average 2008
    selling prices indicated below. In 2007, an increase in average
    crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions compared
    with 2006 increased revenues by approximately $740 million.

The after-tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by
    $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in
    2008, $244 million ($399 million before income taxes)
    in 2007 and $285 million ($449 million before income
    taxes) in 2006. In October 2008, the Corporation closed its
    Brent crude oil hedge positions by entering into offsetting
    contracts with the same counterparty covering
    24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a per
    barrel price of $86.95 each year. The deferred after-tax loss as
    of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in
    earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after-tax
    loss from the closed positions will be approximately
    $335 million from 2009 through 2012. The pretax amounts
    will continue to be recorded as a reduction of revenue and
    allocated to the selling prices of the Corporation’s
    African production.

Production and sales volumes:

The
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was
    381,000 boepd in 2008 compared with 377,000 boepd in
    2007 and 359,000 boepd in 2006. The Corporation currently
    estimates that its 2009 production will average between 380,000
    and 390,000 boepd.



The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as
    follows:

Reflects natural gas production
    converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf
    equals one barrel).

United States:

Crude oil production in
    the United States was higher in 2008 compared with 2007,
    principally due to production from new wells in North Dakota and
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This increased production was
    partially offset by the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of
    Mexico. Natural gas production was lower in 2008, primarily
    reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline. Hurricane
    impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000
    boepd. At December 31, 2008, approximately 15,000 boepd
    remained shut-in from the hurricanes and this production is
    expected to be brought back on line by the end of the first
    quarter of 2009. Crude oil and natural gas production in 2007
    decreased compared with 2006 principally due to natural decline
    and asset sales.

Europe:

Crude oil production in 2008
    was lower than in 2007, due to temporary shut-ins at three North
    Sea fields, cessation of production at the mature Fife, Fergus,
    Flora and Angus Fields, and natural decline. These decreases
    were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Crude
    oil production in 2007 was lower than in 2006, reflecting
    natural decline, facilities work on three North Sea fields, and
    the sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and
    Telford Fields in the United Kingdom, partially offset by higher
    Russian production. Natural gas production was comparable in
    2008 and 2007, but decreased in 2007 compared with 2006
    principally due to lower nominations related to the shut-down of
    a non-operated pipeline and natural decline. The decreases were
    partially offset by higher natural gas production from the
    Atlantic and Cromarty Fields in the United Kingdom which
    commenced in June 2006.

Africa:

Crude oil production increased
    in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher production
    at the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea, partially offset by a
    lower entitlement to Algerian production. Crude oil production
    increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the

start-up

of
    the Okume Complex in December 2006.

Asia and other:

The change in crude oil
    production from 2006 through 2008 principally reflects changes
    to the Corporation’s entitlement to production in
    Azerbaijan. The increase in 2007 compared with 2006 also
    reflects increased gross production from the fields in
    Azerbaijan. Natural gas production increased in 2008 compared
    with 2007 due to increased production from Block

A-18

in the
    Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) and a full
    year of production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia.
    Higher natural gas



production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to new
    production from the Sinphuhorm onshore gas project in Thailand
    which commenced in November 2006 and production from the Ujung
    Pangkah Field which commenced in April 2007. These increases
    were partially offset by the planned shut-down of the JDA to
    install facilities required for Phase 2 gas sales.

Sales volumes:

Higher sales volumes and
    other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately
    $200 million in 2008 compared with 2007 and
    $240 million in 2007 compared with 2006.

Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and
    amortization:

Cash operating costs,
    consisting of production expenses and general and administrative
    expenses, increased by $321 million in 2008 and
    $409 million in 2007 compared with the corresponding
    amounts in prior years (excluding the charges for hurricane
    related costs in 2008 and vacated leased office space in 2006
    that are discussed below). The increases in 2008 and 2007 were
    primarily due to higher production volumes, increased production
    taxes (due to higher realized selling prices), increased costs
    of services and materials and higher employee costs. Cash
    operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $15.49 in
    2008, $13.36 in 2007 and $10.92 in 2006. Cash operating costs in
    2009 are estimated to be in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per
    barrel of oil equivalent.

Excluding the pre-tax amount of asset impairments, depreciation,
    depletion and amortization charges increased by
    $531 million and $232 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher
    production volumes and per barrel costs. Depreciation, depletion
    and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.79
    in 2008, $10.11 in 2007 and $8.85 in 2006. Depreciation,
    depletion and amortization costs for 2009 are estimated to be in
    the range of $13.00 to $14.00 per barrel.

Exploration expenses:

Exploration
    expenses were higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due
    to higher dry hole costs. Exploration expenses were lower in
    2007 compared with 2006, primarily reflecting lower dry hole
    costs, partially offset by increased seismic studies.

Income taxes:

After considering the
    items in the table below, the effective income tax rates for
    Exploration and Production operations were 49% in 2008, 50% in
    2007 and 54% in 2006. The effective income tax rate for E&P
    operations in 2009 is estimated to be in the range of 57% to
    61%. The increase from the 2008 effective rate largely reflects
    the impact of Libyan taxes in a lower commodity price
    environment.

Foreign Exchange:

The after-tax foreign
    currency loss was $84 million in 2008, compared with a loss
    of $7 million in 2007 and a gain of $10 million in
    2006. The increased foreign currency loss reflects the effect of
    significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of
    2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign
    currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses.

Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the
    following items of income (expense) before and after income
    taxes:

2008:

The charge for asset impairments relates
    to mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom
    North Sea. The pre-tax amount of this charge is reflected in
    depreciation, depletion and amortization. The hurricane costs
    relate to expenses associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in
    the Gulf of Mexico and are recorded in production expenses.



2007:

The gain from asset sales relates to the
    sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and
    Telford fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for
    asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the
    United Kingdom North Sea. The estimated production imbalance
    settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter
    readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a
    reduction of sales and other operating revenues.

2006:

The gains from asset sales relate to the
    sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties
    located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore
    Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated
    leased office space in the United Kingdom. The related expenses
    are reflected principally in general and administrative
    expenses. The income tax adjustment represents a one-time
    adjustment to the Corporation’s deferred tax liability
    resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum
    operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%.

The Corporation’s future Exploration and Production
    earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political
    risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural
    gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation,
    exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in
    foreign exchange and income tax rates.

Marketing
    and Refining

Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to
    $277 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and
    $394 million in 2006. After considering the liquidation of
    LIFO inventories reflected in the table on page 21 and
    discussed below, the earnings were $277 million,
    $276 million and $394 million, respectively.

Refining:

Refining earnings, which
    consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
    results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note
    receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous
    operating activities, were $73 million in 2008,
    $193 million in 2007, and $240 million in 2006.

The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s net income was
    $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008,
    $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in
    2007 and $124 million ($201 million before income
    taxes) in 2006. The lower earnings in 2008 and 2007, compared
    with the respective prior years, were principally due to lower
    refining margins. The 2008 utilization rate for the fluid
    catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA reflects lower utilization
    due to weak refining margins, planned and unplanned maintenance
    of certain units, and a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane
    Omar. In 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for
    approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain
    related processing units were also included in this turnaround.
    In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was
    shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled
    maintenance. Cash distributions received by the Corporation from
    HOVENSA were $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007
    and $400 million in 2006.

Pre-tax interest income on the PDVSA note was $4 million,
    $9 million and $15 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Interest income is reflected in other income in
    the income statement. At December 31, 2008, the remaining
    balance of the PDVSA note was $15 million, which was fully
    repaid in February 2009.

Port Reading and other after-tax refining earnings were
    $43 million in 2008, $79 million in 2007 and
    $107 million in 2006, also reflecting lower refining
    margins.

Marketing:

Marketing operations, which
    consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing
    activities, generated income of $240 million in 2008,
    $59 million in 2007 and $108 million in 2006,
    excluding income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in
    2007 totaling $38 million before income taxes
    ($24 million after income taxes).

The increase in 2008 primarily reflects higher margins on
    refined product sales, including sales of retail gasoline
    operations. Refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared
    with 2006. Total refined product sales volumes were
    472,000 barrels per day in 2008, 451,000 barrels per
    day in 2007 and 459,000 barrels per day in 2006. Total
    energy marketing natural gas sales volumes, including utility
    and spot sales, were approximately 2.0 million mcf per day
    in 2008, 1.9 million mcf per day in 2007 and
    1.8 million mcf per day in 2006. In addition, energy
    marketing sold electricity volumes at the rate of 3,200, 2,800
    and 1,400 megawatts (round the clock) in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
    derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
    its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
    trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the
    trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $36 million in
    2008, compared with earnings of $24 million in 2007 and
    $46 million in 2006.

Marketing expenses increased in 2008, principally reflecting
    growth in energy marketing activities, higher credit card fees
    in retail gasoline operations, and increased transportation
    costs.

The Corporation’s future Marketing and Refining earnings
    may be impacted by external factors, including volatility in
    margins, competitive industry conditions, government
    regulations, credit risk, and supply and demand factors,
    including the effects of weather.

Excluding the item affecting comparability between periods, the
    increase in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007
    primarily reflects losses on pension related investments, higher
    employee costs, and higher professional fees. The increase in
    net corporate expenses in 2007 compared with 2006 principally
    reflects higher employee costs, including stock based
    compensation. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses in 2009 are
    estimated to be in the range of $165 to $175 million.

In 2007, Corporate expenses include a charge of $25 million
    ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE
    litigation. The pre-tax amount of this charge is recorded in
    general and administrative expenses.

The decrease in interest incurred in 2008 principally reflects
    lower average debt. The decrease in capitalized interest in 2008
    reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007
    and 2006. Interest expense in each period includes the cost of
    letters of credit primarily issued to counterparties in hedging
    and trading activities. After-tax interest expense in 2009 is
    expected to be in the range of $230 to $240 million. See
    Future Capital Requirements and Resources for discussion of a
    $1,250 million note issuance in the first quarter of 2009.

Sales
    and Other Operating Revenues

Sales and other operating revenues totaled $41,165 million
    in 2008, an increase of 30% compared with 2007. In 2007, sales
    and other operating revenues totaled $31,647 million, an
    increase of 13% compared with 2006. The increase in each year
    reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of crude oil,
    higher refined product selling prices and increased sales
    volumes of electricity.

The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally
    reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined
    products and purchased natural gas and electricity.

    the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the
    Corporation’s Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation
    also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by
    acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer
    accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of
    approximately $100 million. In 2007, capital expenditures
    include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan
    Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In
    2006, capital expenditures included payments of
    $359 million to re-enter the Corporation’s former oil
    and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya
    and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the
    West Med Block in Egypt.

In 2007, the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million
    for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields
    located in the United Kingdom. Proceeds from asset sales in 2006
    totaled $444 million, including the sale of the
    Corporation’s interests in certain producing properties in
    the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast.

Financing Activities:

During 2008, net
    repayments of debt were $32 million compared with net
    borrowings of $208 million in 2007. In 2006, the
    Corporation reduced debt by $13 million.

Total common and preferred stock dividends paid were
    $130 million, $127 million and $161 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Corporation received net
    proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related
    income tax benefits, of $340 million, $110 million and
    $40 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Future
    Capital Requirements and Resources

The Corporation anticipates $3.2 billion in capital and
    exploratory expenditures in 2009, of which $3.1 billion
    relates to Exploration and Production operations. Of the total
    E&P amount, $1.4 billion is for production and
    $900 million is for developments, with the remainder for
    exploration. The anticipated 2009 capital program



represents a decrease of approximately $1.6 billion from
    2008, primarily as a result of lower crude oil selling prices.
    The Corporation also has maturities of long-term debt of
    $143 million in 2009. The Corporation anticipates that it
    can fund its 2009 operations, including planned capital
    expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt
    repayments, with existing cash on-hand, projected cash flow from
    operations and available credit facilities. Crude oil and
    natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict in the
    near term as a result of the recent global economic recession.
    In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s
    capital expenditure program could occur. The Corporation will
    take steps as necessary to protect its financial flexibility,
    and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the
    issuance of debt or equity securities, or asset sales.

The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated,
    revolving credit facility (the facility), of which
    $2,925 million is committed through May 2012. The facility
    can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2008, additional available capacity under the
    facility was $2,474 million.

The Corporation has a

364-day

asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts
    receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the
    terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the
    ability to borrow or issue letters of credit up to
    $500 million, subject to the availability of sufficient
    levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2008,
    outstanding borrowings under this facility were collateralized
    by $1,249 million of accounts receivable, which are held by
    a wholly-owned subsidiary. These receivables are not available
    to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before
    repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed
    facility. At December 31, 2008, $500 million of
    outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed credit facility
    are classified as long-term based on the Corporation’s
    available capacity under the committed revolving credit facility.

In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of
    5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and
    $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a
    coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to
    repay revolving credit debt and outstanding borrowings on other
    credit facilities. The remainder of the proceeds is available
    for working capital and other corporate purposes.

The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may
    issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
    preferred stock.

A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporation’s debt
    to equity ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an
    additional $16.6 billion for the construction or
    acquisition of assets at December 31, 2008. The Corporation
    has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.8 billion
    of secured debt at December 31, 2008 under the loan
    agreement covenants.

In order to reduce credit risk, the Corporation has agreements
    with counterparties to exchange collateral which is determined
    based on the fair values of positions held under these
    agreements. The Corporation’s $3.8 billion of letters
    of credit outstanding at December 31, 2008 were primarily
    issued to satisfy collateral requirements. Additionally, the
    Corporation has posted cash collateral of approximately
    $394 million and has received cash



collateral of approximately $705 million from its hedging
    and trading counterparties. Changes in commodity prices can have
    a material impact on collateral requirements under these
    agreements.

Credit
    Ratings

There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the
    Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently
    assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporation’s
    debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on the
    Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin
    requirements from non-trading and trading counterparties, are
    subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating
    changes.

The Corporation intends to
    continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA.
    Estimated future purchases amount to approximately
    $4.0 billion annually using year-end 2008 prices.

In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
    commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
    HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
    sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future
    supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market
    prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA,
    and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included
    are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional
    gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail
    marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
    facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to
    purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply
    contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These
    commitments were computed based on year-end market prices.

The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including a
    portion of the Corporation’s planned $3.2 billion
    capital investment program for 2009 that is contractually
    committed at December 31, 2008. Obligations for operating
    expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic
    purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal
    business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect
    contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2008, including asset retirement obligations,
    pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for
    uncertain income tax positions.

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline
    stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets
    for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating
    leases. During 2007, the Corporation entered into a lease
    agreement for a new drillship and related support services for
    use in its global deepwater exploration and development
    activities beginning in the middle of 2009. The total payments
    under this five year contract are expected to be approximately
    $950 million.

The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring
    in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a
    retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately
    $175 million as of December 31, 2008.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
    HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other
    than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee
    fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil



purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2008
    amounted to $78 million. In addition, the Corporation has
    agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to
    the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt
    obligations.

The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit
    and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly
    related to its business, as follows:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance
    sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
    Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is
    $491 million at December 31, 2008 compared with
    $493 million at December 31, 2007. The
    Corporation’s December 31, 2008 debt to capitalization
    ratio would increase from 24.3% to 26.5% if these leases were
    included as debt.

See also Note 4, “Refining Joint Venture,” and
    Note 16, “Guarantees and Contingencies,” in the
    notes to the financial statements.

Foreign
    Operations

The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities
    principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark,
    Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya,
    Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and
    the United States. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the
    risks associated with foreign operations, including political
    risk, tax law changes, and currency risk.

HOVENSA owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin
    Islands. In 2002, there was a political disruption in Venezuela
    that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in
    refining operations; however, this disruption did not have a
    material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial
    position.

Accounting
    Policies

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
    assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
    accounting methods used can affect net income,
    stockholders’ equity and various financial statement
    ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies
    generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
    after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
    producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if
    there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational
    viability of the project, the



capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of
    sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and
    operating viability of a project include: commitment of project
    personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with
    customers, negotiations with governments, operators and
    contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other
    factors.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:

The
    determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant
    element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration
    and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves
    affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation
    rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as
    impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
    accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
    requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
    reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
    producible, government and project operator approvals must be
    obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost,
    senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund
    the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve
    estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent
    third party reserve determination as well as internal technical
    appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own
    internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical
    staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The
    Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates
    throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells,
    performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To
    provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve
    estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and
    approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are
    subject to internal technical audits and senior management
    review.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary
    Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (FAS) 69

Disclosures about Oil and Gas
    Producing Activities

(FAS 69) are determined
    independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton
    (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually,
    the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological
    and geophysical data, actual production histories and other
    information necessary for the reserve determination. The
    Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to
    review and discuss the information provided. Senior management
    and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates
    issued by D&M.

On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission published a final rule which revises its oil and gas
    reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The revisions
    are effective for filings on

Form 10-K

for fiscal years ending December 31, 2009. The Corporation
    is evaluating the impact of these requirements on its oil and
    gas reserve estimates and disclosures.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
    Goodwill:

As explained below there are
    significant differences in the way long-lived assets and
    goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas
    fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable
    cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
    other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the
    long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by
    undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are
    impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
    impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
    generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash
    flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
    net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
    future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
    historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
    projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted
    rate, The projected production volumes represent reserves,
    including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a
    stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production
    volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with
    internal projections and other externally reported information.
    Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will
    generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of
    discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure
    requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year.

The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived
    Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its
    best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery
    factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the
    timing of future production and other factors, which are updated
    each time an impairment test is performed. The



Corporation could have impairments if the projected production
    volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural
    gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period
    or future estimated capital and operating costs increase
    significantly.

In accordance with FAS 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, the Corporation’s goodwill is not
    amortized, but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit
    level, which is an operating segment or one level below an
    operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in
    the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be
    recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and
    measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from
    the manner in which the business is managed. The
    Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and
    Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of
    goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment.

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the Exploration
    and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted
    anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known
    developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value
    of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium
    to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential
    synergies including cost savings, access to new business
    opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and
    increased market share. The Corporation also considers the
    relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production
    companies.

The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and
    Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and
    gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and
    market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and
    natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a
    decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production
    operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived
    assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
    testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
    would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the
    Exploration and Production segment.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation
    recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset
    retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any
    legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is
    recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
    Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the
    carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which
    the liability is incurred. In order to measure these
    obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the
    obligations by discounting the future payments that will be
    required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these
    estimates, the Corporation is required to make several
    assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement,
    timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements,
    inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are
    other external factors which could significantly affect the
    ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including:
    changes in environmental regulations and other statutory
    requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign
    currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a
    result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement
    obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described
    above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in
    adjustments to both the liability and related asset values.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading
    activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In
    trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a
    consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and
    derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps,
    based on expectations of future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under
    FAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

, are recognized currently in earnings.
    Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash
    flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of
    firm commitments (fair



value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of
    derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded
    as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for
    cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same
    period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The
    ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in
    earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The
    change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is
    recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized
    currently in earnings.

Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair
    value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before
    they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on
    an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify
    for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective
    effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical
    simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical
    observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot
    prices.

Fair Value Measurements:

The
    Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental
    pension plan investments are carried at fair value, with changes
    in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive
    income each period. In determining fair value, the Corporation
    uses various valuation approaches, including the market and
    income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value
    measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of
    money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for
    receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is
    considered for accrued liabilities.

The Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS 157,

Fair
    Value Measurements

(FAS 157), effective January 1,
    2008. FAS 157 establishes a hierarchy for the inputs used
    to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which
    generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in
    a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates
    determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple
    inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of
    fair value for each financial asset or liability is based on the
    lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.
    Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the
    fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are as
    follows

:

Fair value measurements based on Level 1
    inputs:

Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices
    of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in
    which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available
    and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with
    sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair
    value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded
    futures and options are considered Level 1. In addition,
    fair values for the majority of the Corporation’s
    supplemental pension plan investments are considered
    Level 1, since they are determined using quotations from
    national securities exchanges.

Fair value measurements based on Level 2
    inputs:

Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from
    quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered
    Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include
    over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an
    exchange traded curve, but have contractual terms that are not
    identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes
    fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain
    forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the
    Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as
    Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3
    inputs:

Measurements that are least observable are estimated from
    related market data, determined from sources with little or no
    market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with
    longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business,
    the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers
    and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts.
    The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on
    specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are
    classified as Level 3.

Income Taxes:

Judgments are required in
    the determination and recognition of income tax assets and
    liabilities in the financial statements. These judgements
    include the requirement to only recognize the financial
    statement effect of a tax position when management believes that
    it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits,
    the position will be sustained upon examination.



The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit
    carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United
    States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses
    and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax
    assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and
    tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments
    are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being
    realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
    is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that
    is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of
    deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal
    periods for temporary differences, available carryforward
    periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards,
    estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax
    planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and
    other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on
    assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are
    consistent with the Corporation’s internal business
    forecasts. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations.

Retirement Plans:

The Corporation has
    funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an
    unfunded supplemental pension plan. In accordance with
    FAS 158,

Employer’s Accounting For Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(FAS 158), the
    Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in
    the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these
    plans.

The determination of the obligations and expenses related to
    these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most
    significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring
    the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term
    rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in
    compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made
    by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external
    factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the
    Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a
    portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with
    maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan
    obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is
    developed from the expected future returns for each asset
    category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to
    that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a
    material impact on the amounts reported in the
    Corporation’s financial statements.

Changes
    in Accounting Policies

As discussed on page 35, the Corporation adopted
    FAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. The impact of
    adopting FAS 157 was not material to the Corporation’s
    results of operations. Upon adoption, the Corporation recorded a
    reduction in the net deferred hedge losses reflected in
    accumulated other comprehensive income, which increased
    stockholders’ equity by $193 million, after income
    taxes.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Corporation applied the
    provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force

08-5

,
    Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
    with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement

(EITF 08-5).

Upon adoption, the Corporation revalued certain derivative
    liabilities collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the
    Corporation’s credit rating rather than the credit rating
    of the issuing bank. The adoption resulted in an increase in
    sales and other operating revenues of approximately
    $13 million and an increase in other comprehensive income
    of approximately $78 million, with a corresponding decrease
    in derivative liabilities recorded within accounts payable.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standard

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51

(FAS 160).
    FAS 160 changes the accounting for and reporting of
    noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. The Corporation will
    adopt the provisions of FAS 160 effective January 1,
    2009 and estimates that adoption will result in a decrease in
    other long term liabilities and an increase in
    stockholders’ equity of approximately $85 million.

Environment,
    Health and Safety

The Corporation has implemented a values-based,
    socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment,
    health and safety performance and making a positive impact on
    communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s
    environment, health, safety and social responsibility
    (EHS & SR) policies and by



environment and safety management systems that help protect the
    Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities.
    The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold
    or exceed international standards and are intended to promote
    internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and
    continual improvement in EHS & SR performance.
    Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the
    Corporation’s operating costs and could also require
    increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to
    assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to
    enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity
    and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral
    benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation
    has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit
    facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and
    emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR
    goals.

The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation
    distributes fuel oils in the United States. Proposals by state
    regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would
    require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils. If adopted, these
    proposals could require capital expenditures by the Registrant
    and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards.

As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in
    2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the
    U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining
    Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed
    to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries.
    Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing
    these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control
    nearly 90% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with
    the EPA are continuing and substantial progress has been made
    toward resolving this matter for both the Corporation and
    HOVENSA. While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum
    Refining Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement
    is reached and entered by a court, additional future capital
    expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over
    a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not
    expected to be material to the Corporation.

The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and
    reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including
    carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that
    climate change is a global environmental concern with
    potentially significant consequences for society and the energy
    industry. The Corporation is committed to the responsible
    management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets
    and future developments and is developing and implementing a
    strategy to control our carbon emissions.

The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for
    environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective
    action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals,
    onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries
    (including solid waste management units under permits issued
    pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and,
    although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites
    where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible
    party.

The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
    remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable. At year-end 2008, the Corporation’s
    reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was
    approximately $61 million. The Corporation expects that
    existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately
    cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The
    Corporation’s remediation spending was $23 million in
    2008, $23 million in 2007 and $15 million in 2006.
    Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with
    federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for
    the low sulfur requirements, were $15 million in 2008 and
    $22 million in 2007 and 2006.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including
    references to the Corporation’s future results of
    operations and financial position, liquidity and capital
    resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax
    rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and
    environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and
    contractual obligations and contingencies include
    forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are
    based on the Corporation’s current understanding and
    assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about
    the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures
    because of changes in market conditions, government actions and
    other factors.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
    to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
    natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
    changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
    disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as
    non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading
    operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a
    consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities. These
    activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related
    to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.
    The following describes how these risks are controlled and
    managed.

Controls:

The Corporation maintains a
    control environment under the direction of its chief risk
    officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the
    Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls
    include volumetric, term and

value-at-risk

limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use
    of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored
    daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to
    senior management. The Corporation’s risk management
    department also performs independent verifications of sources of
    fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls
    apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading
    activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The
    Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for
    administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging
    programs.

Instruments:

The Corporation primarily
    uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward
    contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based
    securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These
    contracts are generally widely traded instruments with
    standardized terms. The following describes these instruments
    and how the Corporation uses them:

•

Forward Commodity Contracts:

The Corporation
    enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of
    commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the
    contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity.
    Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and
    sale contracts under FAS 133 are excluded from the
    quantitative market risk disclosures.

•

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:

The
    Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the
    British pound, the Norwegian krone, and the Danish krone, which
    commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these
    currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date.

•

Exchange Traded Contracts:

The Corporation
    uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number
    of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are
    settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to
    exchange position limits.

•

Swaps:

The Corporation uses financially
    settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging
    and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are
    determined based on underlying commodity prices and are
    typically settled over the life of the contract.

•

Options:

Options on various underlying energy
    commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts
    and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the
    Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk
    of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying
    the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a
    premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the
    favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These
    premiums are a component of the fair value of the options.

•

Energy Securities:

Energy securities include
    energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or
    government or related derivatives on these securities.



Value-at-Risk:

The
    Corporation uses

value-at-risk

to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and
    non-trading activities. The

value-at-risk

model uses historical simulation and the results represent the
    potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence
    level. The model captures both first and second order
    sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the

value-at-risk

results for trading and non-trading activities. These results
    may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading
    activities or hedging levels change in non-trading activities.

Non-trading:

The Corporation’s
    non-trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and
    natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the
    selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future
    production and the related gains or losses are an integral part
    of the Corporation’s selling prices. In October 2008, the
    Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedge positions by
    entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty
    covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a
    per barrel price of $86.95 each year. The after-tax deferred
    losses related to closed crude oil contracts will be recorded in
    earnings as the contracts mature.

There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production
    at December 31, 2008. The Corporation also markets energy
    commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas
    and electricity. The Corporation uses futures, swaps and options
    to manage the risk in its marketing activities. Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2008
    includes after-tax deferred losses of $1,478 million
    primarily related to closed crude oil contracts that were used
    as hedges of exploration and production sales.

The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
    exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
    forward contracts for various currencies including the British
    pound, the Norwegian krone and the Danish krone. At
    December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $896 million of
    notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2009. The
    fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a payable of
    $75 million at December 31, 2008. The change in fair
    value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20% change in
    exchange rates is estimated to be approximately
    $165 million at December 31, 2008.

The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,955 million
    has a fair value of $3,883 million at December 31,
    2008. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the
    fair value of debt by approximately $85 million at
    December 31, 2008.

Trading:

In trading activities, the
    Corporation is primarily exposed to changes in crude oil,
    natural gas and refined product prices. The trading partnership
    in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy
    commodities, securities and derivatives. The accounts of the
    partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The
    Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account.
    The information that follows represents 100% of the trading
    partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading
    accounts.



Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
    the time of sale. Total realized gains (losses) on trading
    activities amounted to $(317) million in 2008 and
    $303 million in 2007. Derivative trading transactions are
    marked-to-market and unrealized gains or losses are reflected in
    income currently. The following table provides an assessment of
    the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading
    activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and
    other trading activities.

    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
    as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
    on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness
    of the Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, as stated in their
    report, which is included herein.

Report of

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008 based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
    related statements of consolidated income, cash flows,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income of Hess
    Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008, and our report
    dated February 20, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of
    consolidated income, cash flows, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the
    Financial Statement Schedule listed in the Index at Item 8.
    These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
    of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
    consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related Financial Statement Schedule, when considered in
    relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Corporation adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
    effective January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hess
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 20, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:

Hess Corporation
    and subsidiaries (the Corporation) engage in the exploration for
    and the development, production, purchase, transportation and
    sale of crude oil and natural gas. These activities are
    conducted principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil,
    Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia,
    Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, the United
    Kingdom and the United States. In addition, the Corporation
    manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined
    petroleum and other energy products. The Corporation owns 50% of
    HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a refinery joint venture in the United
    States Virgin Islands. An additional refining facility,
    terminals and retail gasoline stations, most of which include
    convenience stores, are located on the East Coast of the United
    States.

In preparing financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
    management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses in the income statement. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Among the estimates
    made by management are oil and gas reserves, asset valuations,
    depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental
    obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes.

Principles of Consolidation:

The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess
    Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
    a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
    The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
    and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
    consolidated.

Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned, including
    HOVENSA, are stated at cost of acquisition plus the
    Corporation’s equity in undistributed net income since
    acquisition. The Corporation consolidates the trading
    partnership in which it owns a 50% voting interest and over
    which it exercises control.

Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
    consolidation.

Revenue Recognition:

The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas,
    petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to
    the customer. Sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes
    in the consolidated statement of income. The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas
    properties based on sales to customers. Differences between
    natural gas volumes sold and the Corporation’s share of
    natural gas production are not material. Revenues from natural
    gas and electricity sales by the Corporation’s marketing
    operations are recognized based on meter readings and estimated
    deliveries to customers since the last meter reading.

In its exploration and production activities, the Corporation
    enters into crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the
    same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one
    another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality.
    Similarly, in its marketing activities, the Corporation also
    enters into refined product purchase and sale transactions with
    the same counterparty. These arrangements are reported net in
    sales and other operating revenues in the consolidated statement
    of income.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading
    activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices
    of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading
    activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated
    partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives, including
    futures, forwards, options and swaps based on expectations of
    future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under
    FAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,

are recognized currently in earnings.
    Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash
    flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of
    firm commitments (fair



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of
    derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded
    as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for
    cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same
    period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The
    ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in
    earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The
    change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is
    recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized
    currently in earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
    equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are
    readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three
    months or less when acquired.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at
    the lower of cost or market. For refined product inventories
    valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) inventory method. For the remaining
    inventories, cost is generally determined using average actual
    costs.

Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. In accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Staff

Position 19-1,

Accounting for Suspended Well Costs

, which amended
    FAS 19,

Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and
    Gas Producing Companies

(FAS 19), exploratory drilling
    costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if
    (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
    justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient
    progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the
    economic and operating viability of the project. If either of
    those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt
    about the economic or operational viability of a project, the
    capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of
    sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and
    operating viability of a project include commitment of project
    personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with
    customers, negotiations with governments, operators and
    contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other
    factors.

Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization:

The Corporation records
    depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties
    using the units of production method over proved oil and gas
    reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas
    production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of
    production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves.
    Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on
    the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Retail
    gas stations and equipment related to a leased property, are
    depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed the
    remaining lease period. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped
    oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other
    factors.

Capitalized Interest:

Interest from
    external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using
    the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the
    project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
    use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from
    the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful
    lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of
    the underlying assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. The Corporation
    accounts for asset retirement obligations as required by
    FAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

and FASB Interpretation 47,

Accounting for Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations.

Under these standards, a
    liability is recognized for the fair value of legally required
    asset retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets
    in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred.
    In addition, the fair value of any legally



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if
    the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation
    capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the
    carrying amount of the long-lived assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts are not
    expected to be recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the
    assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The
    amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the
    assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future
    net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the net
    present value of future cash flows is based on management’s
    best estimate of future prices, which is determined with
    reference to recent historical prices and published forward
    prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted
    at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes
    represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be
    produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.
    The production volumes, prices and timing of production are
    consistent with internal projections and other externally
    reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining
    asset impairments will generally differ from the year-end prices
    used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
    flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The
    Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    other than temporary decline in value has occurred. The amount
    of the impairment is based on quoted market prices, where
    available, or other valuation techniques.

Impairment of Goodwill:

In accordance
    with FAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,
    goodwill is not amortized; however, it is tested for impairment
    annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill
    may not be recoverable. This impairment test is calculated at
    the reporting unit level, which for the Corporation’s
    goodwill is the Exploration and Production operating segment.
    The Corporation identifies potential impairments by comparing
    the fair value of the reporting unit to its book value,
    including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the
    carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Corporation
    calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied
    fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If the implied
    fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an
    impairment would be recorded.

Maintenance and Repairs:

Maintenance
    and repairs are expensed as incurred, including costs of
    refinery turnarounds. Capital improvements are recorded as
    additions in property, plant and equipment.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP)
    AUG AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance
    Activities.

This FSP eliminated the previously acceptable

accrue-in-advance

method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As required,
    the Corporation retrospectively applied the provisions of this
    FSP which resulted in a change of its method of accounting to
    recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when
    such costs are incurred. The impact of adopting this FSP
    increased previously reported 2006 earnings by $4 million
    ($.01 per diluted share). All prior period amounts in the
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes reflect
    this retrospective accounting change.

Environmental Expenditures:

The
    Corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs to
    remediate existing conditions related to past operations when
    the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The
    Corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase
    the life or efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent
    future adverse impacts to the environment.

Share-Based Compensation:

The fair
    value of all share-based compensation is expensed and recognized
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards
    in accordance with FAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

,
    which was adopted on January 1, 2006.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are
    determined using the liability method. The Corporation regularly
    assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on
    estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the
    available carryforward periods for net operating losses and
    other factors. If it is more likely than not that some or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation
    allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the
    amount expected to be realized.

The Corporation adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,
    (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. The impact of
    adoption was not material to the Corporation’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. A deferred tax
    asset of $28 million related to an acquired net operating
    loss carryforward was recorded in accordance with FIN 48
    and goodwill was reduced. In addition, effective with its
    adoption of FIN 48, the Corporation recognizes the
    financial statement effect of a tax position only when
    management believes that it is more likely than not, that based
    on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon
    examination. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations. The Corporation classifies interest and penalties
    associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The
    U.S. dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in
    which business is conducted) for most foreign operations.
    Adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and
    liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency
    into the functional currency are recorded in other income. For
    operations that do not use the U.S. dollar as the
    functional currency, adjustments resulting from translating
    foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars
    are recorded in a separate component of stockholders’
    equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Fair Value Measurements:

The
    Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS 157,

Fair
    Value Measurements

(FAS 157), effective January 1,
    2008. FAS 157 establishes a hierarchy for the inputs used
    to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which
    generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in
    a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates
    determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple
    inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of
    fair value for each financial asset or liability is based on the
    lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.
    See Note 15, “Fair Value Measurements”, for more
    details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the
    fair values of the financial assets and liabilities.

The impact of adopting FAS 157 was not material to the
    Corporation’s results of operations. Upon adoption, the
    Corporation recorded a reduction in the net deferred hedge
    losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income,
    which increased stockholders’ equity by $193 million,
    after income taxes.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Corporation applied the
    provisions of Emerging Issues Task

Force 08-5

,
    Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
    with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement

(EITF 08-5).

Upon adoption, the Corporation revalued certain derivative
    liabilities collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the
    Corporation’s credit rating rather than the credit rating
    of the issuing bank. The adoption resulted in an increase in
    sales and other operating revenues of approximately
    $13 million and an increase in accumulated other
    comprehensive income of approximately $78 million, with a
    corresponding decrease in derivative liabilities recorded within
    accounts payable.

Retirement Plans:

Effective
    December 31, 2006, the Corporation adopted FAS 158,

Employer’s Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans

, which required the recognition
    of the underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement
    plans on the balance sheet. For the Corporation’s pension
    plans, the underfunded status is measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit
    obligation. For the Corporation’s postretirement medical
    plan, the underfunded status represents the difference between
    the fair value of plan assets and the accumulated postretirement
    benefit obligation. The Corporation recognizes the net changes
    in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such
    changes occur.

Recently Issued Accounting Standard:

In
    December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160,

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of ARB 51

(FAS 160). FAS 160 changes the
    accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a
    subsidiary. The Corporation will adopt the provisions



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of FAS 160 effective January 1, 2009 and estimates
    that the impact of adoption will result in a decrease to other
    long term liabilities and an increase to stockholders’
    equity of approximately $85 million.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

2008:

In the third quarter of 2008, the
    Corporation acquired the remaining 22.5% interest in its
    Gabonese subsidiary for $285 million, of which
    $210 million was allocated to proved properties. The
    Corporation expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring
    fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a
    terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately
    $100 million.

2007:

In the first quarter of 2007, the
    Corporation completed the acquisition of a 28% interest in the
    Genghis Khan oil and gas development located in the deepwater
    Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and 608 for
    $371 million, of which $342 million was allocated to
    proved and unproved properties and the remainder to wells and
    equipment. This transaction was accounted for as an asset
    acquisition. Genghis Khan has been unitized with the Shenzi
    development.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Corporation completed the
    sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in
    the United Kingdom for $93 million and recorded a gain of
    $21 million ($15 million after income taxes). At the
    time of sale, these two fields were producing at a combined net
    rate of 6,500 barrels of oil per day.

    Corporation reduced LIFO inventories, which are carried at lower
    costs than current inventory costs. The effect of the LIFO
    inventory liquidations was to decrease cost of products sold by
    approximately $38 million ($24 million after income
    taxes).

    provision.

The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of
    $50 million, $300 million and $400 million during
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Corporation’s share
    of HOVENSA’s undistributed income aggregated
    $206 million at December 31, 2008.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value
    of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers
    other than PDVSA. The guarantee amounted to $78 million at
    December 31, 2008. This amount fluctuates based on the
    volume of crude oil purchased and the related crude oil prices.
    In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to
    $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to
    meet its senior debt obligations.

At formation of the joint venture in 1999, PDVSA V.I., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA, purchased a 50% interest in
    the fixed assets of the Corporation’s Virgin Islands
    refinery for $62.5 million in cash and a

note
    from PDVSA V.I. for $562.5 million bearing interest at
    8.46% per annum and requiring principal payments over its term.
    The principal balance of the note was $15 million and
    $76 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2008, the Corporation’s fixed rate
    debentures have a principal amount of $2,816 million
    ($2,803 million net of unamortized discount). Interest
    rates on the outstanding fixed rate debentures have a weighted
    average rate of 7.3%.

The Corporation has a $3.0 billion syndicated revolving
    credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings
    and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed
    through May 2012. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation has
    available capacity on the facility of $2,474 million.
    Current borrowings under the facility bear interest at 0.4%
    above the London Interbank Offered Rate and a facility fee of
    0.1% per annum is payable on the amount of the credit line. The
    interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the
    Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation has a

364-day

asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts
    receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the
    terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the
    ability to borrow or issue letters of credit up to
    $500 million, subject to the availability of sufficient
    levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2008,
    outstanding borrowings under this facility were collateralized
    by $1,249 million of accounts receivable, which are held by
    a wholly-owned subsidiary. These receivables are not available
    to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before
    repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed
    facility. At December 31, 2008, $500 million of
    outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed credit facility
    are classified as long-term based on the Corporation’s
    available capacity under the committed revolving credit facility.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a
    financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings
    and secured debt. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation is
    permitted to borrow up to an additional $16.6 billion for
    the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has
    the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.8 billion of
    secured debt at December 31, 2008.

The intrinsic value (or the amount by which the market price of
    the Corporation’s Common Stock exceeds the exercise price
    of an option) for outstanding options and exercisable options at
    December 31, 2008 was $80 million and
    $76 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008,
    assuming forfeitures of 2% per year, 9,500,000 outstanding
    options are expected to vest at a weighted average exercise
    price of $52.45 per share. At December 31, 2008 the
    weighted average remaining term of exercisable options was
    6 years.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
    fair value of employee stock options. The following weighted

The assumption above for the risk free interest rate is based on

    sources. The stock price volatility is determined from
    historical experience using the same period as the expected
    terms of the options. The expected stock option term is based on
    historical exercise patterns and the expected future holding
    period.

In May 2008, shareholders approved the 2008 Long-Term Incentive
    Plan. The Corporation also has stock options outstanding under a

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency gains (losses) before income taxes amounted to
    $(212) million in 2008, $17 million in 2007 and
    $21 million in 2006. The foreign currency loss in 2008
    reflects the effect of significant exchange rate movements in
    the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets,
    liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain
    foreign businesses. The balances in accumulated other

Retirement
    Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plans for a significant portion of its employees. In
    addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
    plan covering certain employees. The unfunded supplemental
    pension plan provides for incremental pension payments from the
    Corporation so that total pension payments equal amounts that
    would have been payable from the Corporation’s principal
    pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax
    regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years
    of service and final average salary. Additionally, the
    Corporation maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan
    that provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from
    ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement
    plans is December 31. The following table summarizes the
    Corporation’s benefit obligations and the fair value of

    which approximately $57 million relates to the amortization
    of unrecognized net actuarial losses.

The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for
    each year were established at the end of each previous year
    while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were
    established at each year-end. The net periodic benefit cost and
    the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on
    actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The
    discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high-quality,
    fixed-income debt instruments with maturities that approximate
    the expected payment of plan obligations. The overall expected
    return on plan assets is developed from the expected future
    returns for each asset category, weighted by the target
    allocation of pension assets to that asset category.

The Corporation’s investment strategy is to maximize
    long-term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad
    diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes.
    Asset classes and target allocations are determined by the
    Corporation’s investment committee and include domestic and
    foreign equities, fixed income securities, and other
    investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private
    equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in
    securities issued by the Corporation unless indirectly held as
    part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets are
    highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment
    requirements.

    12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount
    of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to
    $30 million due to settlements with taxing authorities.

The Corporation has not recorded deferred income taxes
    applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations. The Corporation had undistributed earnings from
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $7.1 billion at

    were not indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
    approximately $2.5 billion would be required, excluding the
    potential use of foreign tax credits in the United States.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in
    the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The
    Corporation is no longer subject to examinations by income tax
    authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2003.

Financial
    Instruments, Non-trading and Trading Activities

Non-trading:

The Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Hedging activities decreased Exploration and Production revenues
    by $685 million in 2008, $399 million in 2007 and
    $449 million in 2006. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness
    gains (losses) reflected in revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $(13) million, $6 million and $(5) million
    respectively.

In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil
    hedge positions by entering into offsetting contracts with the
    same counterparty covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009
    through 2012 at a per barrel price of $86.95 each year. The
    deferred after-tax losses related to the closed crude oil
    contracts will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature.
    The estimated annual after-tax loss from the closed positions
    will be approximately $355 million from 2009 through 2012.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
    December 31, 2008 includes after-tax deferred losses of
    $1,478 million ($1,672 at December 31, 2007) related
    to closed crude oil contracts and certain energy marketing
    contracts. Approximately $515 million of after-tax deferred
    losses is expected to be reclassified into earnings in 2009. The
    pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts
    payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as
    deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.

Commodity Trading:

The Corporation,
    principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy
    commodities, securities and derivatives including futures,
    forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future
    market conditions. The Corporation’s income (loss) before
    income taxes from trading activities, including its share of the
    earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to
    $(57) million in 2008, $49 million in 2007 and
    $83 million in 2006.

Other Financial Instruments:

At
    December 31, 2008, the Corporation has $896 million of
    notional value foreign currency forward contracts maturing
    through 2009 ($977 million at December 31, 2007).
    Notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or
    liabilities of the Corporation, but are used in the calculation
    of cash settlements under the contracts. The fair value of the
    foreign currency forward contracts recorded by the Corporation
    were payables of $75 million and $1 million at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

    value of $3,124 million and a fair value of
    $3,407 million at December 31, 2007.

The Corporation offsets cash collateral received or paid against
    the fair value of its derivative instruments executed with the
    same counterparty. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Corporation is holding cash from counterparties of approximately
    $705 million and $393 million, respectively. The
    Corporation has posted cash to counterparties at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 of approximately
    $394 million and $380 million, respectively.

Credit Risks:

The Corporation’s
    financial instruments expose it to credit risks and may at times
    be concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
    counterparties. Trade receivables in the Exploration and
    Production and Marketing and Refining businesses are generated
    from a diverse domestic and international customer base. The
    Corporation continuously monitors counterparty concentration and
    credit risk. The Corporation reduces its risk related to certain
    counterparties by using master netting agreements and requiring
    collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS 157 effective
    January 1, 2008 (see Note 1, “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies”). FAS 157 establishes
    a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on
    the source of the input, which generally range from quoted
    prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market
    (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market
    data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair
    value, however, the level of fair value for each financial asset
    or liability presented below is based on the lowest significant
    input level within this fair value hierarchy. The following
    table provides the fair value hierarchy of the
    Corporation’s financial assets and (liabilities) as of
    December 31, 2008 (in millions):

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the
    fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are as
    follows:

Fair value measurements based on Level 1
    inputs:

Measurements that are most observable
    are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained
    from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing
    prices are both readily available and representative of fair
    value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and
    volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the
    Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are
    considered Level 1. In addition, fair values for the
    majority of the pension investments are considered Level 1,
    since they are determined using quotations from national
    securities exchanges.

Fair value measurements based on Level 2
    inputs:

Measurements derived indirectly from
    observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are
    less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on
    Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative
    instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve, but
    have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded
    contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements
    based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and
    options. The liability related to the Corporation’s crude
    oil hedges is classified as Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3
    inputs:

Measurements that are least
    observable are estimated from related market data, determined
    from sources with little or no market activity for comparable
    contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example,
    in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural
    gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure
    by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales
    and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid
    delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. There
    may be offsets to these positions that are priced based on more
    liquid markets, which are, therefore, classified as Level 1
    or Level 2.

The following table provides changes in financial assets and
    liabilities that are measured at fair value based on
    Level 3 inputs (in millions):

Guarantees
    and Contingencies

At December 31, 2008, the Corporation’s guarantees
    include $78 million of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases
    and $15 million of HOVENSA’s senior debt obligations.
    In addition, the Corporation has $126 million in letters of
    credit for which it is contingently liable. As a result, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that the Corporation
    could be required to make under its guarantees is
    $219 million at December 31, 2008 ($353 million
    at December 31, 2007). The Corporation also has a
    contingent purchase obligation expiring in April 2010, to
    acquire



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station
    joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated value
    of the purchase obligation is approximately $175 million.

The Corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to
    various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
    environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the
    Corporation’s consolidated financial statements when it is
    probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the
    amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is
    only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however,
    the Corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies in
    accordance with FAS 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving
    water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in
    jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE
    and petroleum refiners who produce gasoline containing MTBE,
    including the Corporation. While the majority of the cases were
    settled in 2008, the Corporation remains a defendant in
    approximately 20 cases. These cases have been consolidated for
    pre-trial purposes in the Southern District of New York as part
    of a multi-district litigation proceeding, with the exception of
    an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire.
    The principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline
    containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties
    are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline
    market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to
    take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the
    environment of releases of MTBE. The damages claimed in these
    actions are substantial and in almost all cases, punitive
    damages are also sought. In the fourth quarter 2007, the
    Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of $40 million
    related to MTBE litigation, including amounts for the cases
    settled in 2008.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries
    covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on
    the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of
    the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has
    previously installed more advanced pollution controls. EPA
    initially contacted the Corporation and HOVENSA regarding the
    Petroleum Refinery Initiative in August 2003. Negotiations with
    EPA and the relevant states and the Virgin Islands are
    continuing and substantial progress has been made toward
    resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA.
    While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining
    Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is
    reached and entered by a court, additional future capital
    expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over
    a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not
    expected to be material to the Corporation.

The United States Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (the
    act) implemented a royalty relief program that relieves eligible
    leases issued between November 28, 1995 and
    November 28, 2000 from paying royalties on deep-water
    production in Federal Outer Continental Shelf lands. Some of the
    Corporation’s leases in the Gulf of Mexico qualify for
    royalty relief under the act. The act is silent on satisfying
    any price thresholds in order to qualify for the royalty relief.
    The U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) created
    regulations that included pricing requirements to qualify for
    the royalty relief provided in the act. The legality of the
    thresholds determined by the MMS has been challenged in federal
    courts. On January 12, 2009, the U.S. 5th Circuit
    Court of Appeals ruled against the MMS, which has until
    March 30, 2009 to seek a rehearing by the 5th Circuit
    Court and until April to seek

leave to bring the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court. At
    December 31, 2008, the Corporation has accrued
    $114 million in liabilities and paid $15 million
    relating to these royalties.

The Corporation is also currently subject to certain other
    existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings, which it considers
    routine and incidental to its business. The Corporation believes
    that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related
    to any of these other known contingent liability exposures would
    have a material adverse impact on its financial position or
    results of operations.

Segment
    Information

The Corporation has two operating segments that comprise the
    structure used by senior management to make key operating
    decisions and assess performance. These are (1) Exploration
    and Production and (2) Marketing and Refining. Exploration
    and Production operations include the exploration for and the
    development, production, purchase, transportation and sale of
    crude oil and natural gas. Marketing and Refining operations
    include the manufacture, purchase, transportation, trading and
    marketing of refined petroleum products, natural gas and
    electricity.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
    accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
    requirements of the FASB. For reserves to be booked as proved
    they must be commercially producible; government approvals must
    be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost,
    senior management or the board of directors, must commit to fund
    the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve
    estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent
    third party reserve determination as well as internal technical
    appraisals of



reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
    estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
    directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
    technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
    based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
    technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
    throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
    guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
    practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
    to internal technical audits and senior management review.

On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission published a final rule which revises its oil and gas
    reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The revisions
    are effective for filings on

Form 10-K

for fiscal year ending December 31, 2009. The Corporation
    is evaluating the impact of these requirements on its oil and
    gas reserve estimates and disclosures.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported below are determined
    independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton
    (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. The
    Corporation provided D&M with engineering, geological and
    geophysical data, actual production histories and other
    information necessary for the reserve determination. The
    Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs met to
    review and discuss the information provided. Senior management
    and the Board of Directors reviewed the final reserve estimates
    issued by D&M.

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying year-end oil
    and gas selling prices (adjusted for price changes provided by
    contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of
    proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development
    and production costs, which are based on year-end costs and
    existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are
    computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax
    rates to the pre-tax net cash flows relating to the
    Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash
    flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The
    discounted future net cash flow estimates required by
    FAS 69 do not include exploration expenses, interest
    expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The
    selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile.
    The year-end prices, which are required to be used for the
    discounted future net cash flows, do not include the effects of
    hedges and may not be representative of future selling prices.
    The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different
    if other assumptions were used.
