Business and Properties

Hess Corporation (the Registrant) is a Delaware corporation,
    incorporated in 1920. The Registrant and its subsidiaries
    (collectively referred to as the “Corporation” or
    “Hess”) is a global integrated energy company that
    operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P)
    and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment
    explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and
    sells crude oil and natural gas. These exploration and
    production activities take place principally in Algeria,
    Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial
    Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway,
    Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. The
    M&R segment manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and
    markets refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.
    The Corporation owns 50% of a refinery joint venture in the
    United States Virgin Islands, and another refining facility,
    terminals and retail gasoline stations, most of which include
    convenience stores, located on the East Coast of the United
    States.

The Corporation presently estimates that its 2008 production
    will be approximately 380,000 to 390,000 barrels of oil
    equivalent per day (boepd). The Corporation is developing a
    number of oil and gas fields and has an inventory of domestic
    and foreign exploration prospects.



United
    States

At December 31, 2007, 19% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in the United States. During 2007,
    15% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids
    production and 14% of its natural gas production were from
    United States operations. The Corporation’s production in
    the United States was principally from properties offshore in
    the Gulf of Mexico, which include the Llano (Hess 50%), Conger
    (Hess 37.5%), Baldpate (Hess 50%), Hack Wilson (Hess 33.3%) and
    Penn State (Hess 50%) fields, onshore in North Dakota including
    interests in the Bakken Play and Williston Basin and the
    Seminole-San Andres Unit (Hess 34.3%) onshore Texas in the
    Permian Basin.

The Shenzi development (Hess 28%) in the Green Canyon area of
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico was sanctioned by the operator in
    2006 and progressed in 2007 with installation of the tension leg
    platform tendon piles and hull fabrication. First production
    from Shenzi is expected to commence in mid-2009. In February
    2007, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 28%
    interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and
    608. The Genghis Khan development is part of the same geological
    structure as the Shenzi development. These fields were unitized
    in 2007. Crude oil production from the Genghis Khan Field
    commenced in October 2007.

Development of a residual oil zone at the
    Seminole-San Andres Unit commenced in the fourth quarter of
    2007 and it is anticipated that production from this development
    will begin in 2009. The Corporation intends to inject carbon
    dioxide gas supplied from its interests in the West Bravo Dome
    and Bravo Dome fields in New Mexico into the residual oil zone
    to enhance recovery of crude oil.

At the Corporation’s Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%)
    located in the Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico a successful sidetrack to the second Tubular Bells well
    was completed during the first quarter of 2007 and the drilling
    of a third well commenced in October 2007. On the Pony prospect
    on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf
    of Mexico a sidetrack from the original discovery well was
    successfully completed in the first quarter of 2007 and a second
    appraisal well is being drilled about 1.5 miles northwest
    of the original discovery well.

At December 31, 2007, the Corporation has interests in more
    than 370 exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, which include
    1,372,529 net undeveloped acres.

Europe

At December 31, 2007, 33% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in Europe (United Kingdom 11%,
    Norway 14%, Denmark 3% and Russia 5%). During 2007, 36% of the
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
    and 42% of its natural gas production were from European
    operations.

United Kingdom:

Production of crude oil
    and natural gas liquids from the United Kingdom North Sea was
    principally from the Corporation’s non-operated interests
    in the Beryl (Hess 22.2%), Bittern (Hess 28.3%), Schiehallion
    (Hess 15.7%) and Clair (Hess 9.3%) fields. Natural gas
    production from the United Kingdom in 2007 was primarily from
    fields in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 28.8%), as well as
    the Everest (Hess 18.7%), Lomond (Hess 16.7%), Beryl (Hess
    22.2%), Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) fields.

In 2007, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in
    the Scott and Telford fields located offshore United Kingdom.

Norway:

Substantially all of the 2007
    and 2006 Norwegian production was from the Corporation’s
    interest in the Valhall Field (Hess 28.1%). A field
    redevelopment for Valhall was sanctioned during 2007. In
    September 2007, gas production commenced at the Snohvit Field
    (Hess 3.26%) located offshore Norway.

    is planned in 2008, and the BM-ES-30 Block (Hess 60%) in the
    Espirito Santo Basin.



Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas reserves at the
    end of 2007, 2006 and 2005 are presented under Supplementary Oil
    and Gas Data on pages 76 through 78 in the accompanying
    financial statements.

During 2007, the Corporation provided oil and gas reserve
    estimates for 2006 to the United States Department of Energy.
    Such estimates are compatible with the information furnished to
    the SEC on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2006, although not
    necessarily directly comparable due to the requirements of the
    individual requests. There were no differences in excess of 5%.

Sales commitments:

The Corporation has
    no contracts or agreements to sell fixed quantities of its crude
    oil production. In the United States, natural gas is marketed on
    a spot basis and under contracts for varying periods to local
    distribution companies, and commercial, industrial and other
    purchasers. The Corporation’s United States natural gas
    production is expected to approximate 30% of its 2008 sales
    commitments under long-term contracts. The Corporation attempts
    to minimize price and supply risks associated with its United
    States natural gas supply commitments by entering into purchase
    contracts with third parties having reliable sources of supply,
    on terms substantially similar to those under its commitments
    and by leasing storage facilities.

In international markets, the Corporation generally sells its
    natural gas production under long-term sales contracts with
    prices that are periodically adjusted due to changes in the
    commodity prices or other indices. In the United Kingdom, the
    Corporation sells the majority of its natural gas production on
    a spot basis.

Of total refined products sold
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005 approximately 50% was obtained from
    HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation purchased the balance
    from third parties under short-term supply contracts and spot
    purchases.

Refining

The Corporation owns a 50% interest in HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA),
    a refining joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands
    with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In
    addition, it owns and operates a refining facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey.

HOVENSA:

Refining operations at HOVENSA
    consist of crude units, a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a
    delayed coker unit.

The following table summarizes capacity and utilization rates
    for HOVENSA:

The delayed coker unit permits HOVENSA to run lower-cost heavy
    crude oil. HOVENSA has a long-term supply contract with PDVSA to
    purchase 115,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy
    crude oil. PDVSA also supplies 155,000 barrels per day of
    Venezuelan Mesa medium gravity crude oil to HOVENSA under a

long-term

crude oil supply contract. The remaining crude oil requirements
    are purchased mainly under contracts of one year or less from
    third parties and through spot purchases on the open market.
    After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third parties, the
    Corporation purchases 50% of HOVENSA’s remaining production
    at market prices.



Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 454,000 barrels per
    day in 2007 compared with 448,000 barrels per day in 2006
    and 461,000 barrels per day in 2005. During the second
    quarter of 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shut down for
    approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. The fluid
    catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for
    approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance in 2006.

Port Reading Facility:

The Corporation
    owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey, with a capacity of 65,000 barrels per
    day. This facility, which processes residual fuel oil and vacuum
    gas oil, operated at a rate of approximately 61,000 barrels
    per day in 2007 compared with 63,000 barrels per day in
    2006 and 55,000 barrels per day in 2005. Substantially all
    of Port Reading’s production is gasoline and heating oil.

Marketing

The Corporation markets refined petroleum products on the East
    Coast of the United States to the motoring public, wholesale
    distributors, industrial and commercial users, other petroleum
    companies, governmental agencies and public utilities. It also
    markets natural gas and electricity to utilities and other
    industrial and commercial customers.

The Corporation has 1,371
    HESS

®

gasoline stations at December 31, 2007, including stations
    owned by the WilcoHess joint venture (Hess 44%). Approximately
    90% of the gasoline stations are operated by the Company or
    WilcoHess. Of the operated stations, 93% have convenience stores
    on the sites. Most of the Corporation’s gasoline stations
    are in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida,
    Massachusetts, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Refined product sales averaged 451,000 barrels per day in
    2007 compared with 459,000 barrels per day in 2006 and
    456,000 barrels in 2005. Total energy marketing natural gas
    sales volumes, including utility and spot sales, were
    approximately 1.9 million mcf per day in 2007,
    1.8 million mcf per day in 2006 and 1.7 million mcf
    per day in 2005. In addition, energy marketing sold electricity
    volumes at the rate of 2,800, 1,400 and 500 megawatts (round the

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors Related to Our Business and Operations

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant risk factors, including those described
    below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect
    our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of
    operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our
    securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is
    possible additional risks relating to our securities may be
    described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in
    the future.

Commodity Price Risk:

Our estimated proved
    reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins,
    future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on
    the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum
    products, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our
    control. Historically these prices have been very volatile. The
    major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the
    Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert
    considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil
    and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to
    agree on a common policy on rates of production and other
    matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The
    commodities trading markets may also influence the selling
    prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products.
    A significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a
    material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and cash
    flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of
    our oil and gas assets, goodwill and proved oil and gas
    reserves. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to
    mitigate commodity price volatility, we will not realize the
    benefit of price increases above the hedged price.

Technical Risk:

We own or have access to a
    finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted
    over time. Replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to
    successful exploration drilling, development activities, and
    enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas
    production is dependent on technical success in finding and
    developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity
    involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and
    geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the
    presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling
    risks include adverse unexpected conditions, irregularities in
    pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather
    interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen
    reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or
    flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities
    have also been increasing, which could negatively affect
    expected economic returns. Although due diligence is used in
    evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar
    uncertainties may be encountered in the production of oil and
    gas on properties acquired from others.

Oil and Gas Reserves and Discounted Future Net Cash Flow
    Risks:

Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating
    quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those
    reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices,
    revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses,
    geologic success and quantities of recoverable oil and gas
    reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the
    estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities
    and future net revenues of our proved reserves. In addition,
    reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions
    based on production performance, purchases or sales of
    properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and
    gas prices, production sharing contracts which may decrease
    reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other
    factors.

Political Risk:

Federal, state, local,
    territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax
    increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property,
    mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of
    contract rights, and changes in import regulations, as well as
    other political developments may affect our operations. Some of
    the international areas in which we operate may be politically
    less stable than our domestic operations. In addition, the
    increasing threat of terrorism around the world poses additional
    risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. In our
    M&R segment, we market motor fuels through lessee-dealers
    and wholesalers in



certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners
    of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor
    fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the
    U.S. Congress and in various other states.

Environmental Risk:

Our oil and gas
    operations, like those of the industry, are subject to
    environmental hazards such as oil spills, produced water spills,
    gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases
    that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or
    other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to
    numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign
    environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these
    laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or
    criminal penalties, remedial

clean-ups

and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition,
    increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly
    relating to the production of motor and other fuels and the
    potential for controls on greenhouse gas emissions, have
    resulted, and will likely continue to result, in higher capital
    expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas
    industry in general.

Competitive Risk:

The petroleum industry is
    highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter
    competition from numerous companies in each of our activities,
    including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural
    gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined products and
    natural gas. Many competitors, including national oil companies,
    are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also
    in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of
    energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets
    has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In
    addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise
    and equipment has affected the availability of technical
    personnel and drilling rigs and has increased capital and
    operating costs.

Catastrophic Risk:

Although we maintain a
    level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices
    against property and casualty losses, our oil and gas operations
    are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or
    destroy assets or interrupt operations. Examples of catastrophic
    risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts. These
    occurrences have affected us from time to time. During 2005, our
    annual Gulf of Mexico production of crude oil and natural gas
    was reduced by 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
    (boepd) due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Registrant, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of substantially identical
    lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental
    entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States
    against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produce
    gasoline containing MTBE, including the Registrant. These cases
    have been consolidated in the Southern District of New York and,
    as of the end of 2007, the Registrant is named as a defendant in
    51 of approximately 80 cases pending. The principal allegation
    in all cases is that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective
    product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion
    to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater
    resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate
    the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The
    damages claimed in these actions are substantial and in some
    cases, punitive damages are also sought. In April 2005, the
    District Court denied the primary legal aspects of the
    defendants’ motion to dismiss these actions. As a result of
    Court-ordered mediation, the Registrant anticipates that
    settlement will be reached in a number of the pending cases, the
    number and terms of which are currently being negotiated and are
    subject to a confidentiality agreement. In the fourth quarter
    2007, the Registrant recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $40 million related to MTBE litigation.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual



refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly,
    depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the
    circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the
    refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution
    controls. EPA initially contacted Registrant and HOVENSA L.L.C.
    (HOVENSA), its 50% owned joint venture with Petroleos de
    Venezuela, which owns and operates a refinery in the
    U.S. Virgin Islands, regarding the Petroleum Refinery
    Initiative in August 2003 and discussions resumed in August
    2005. The Registrant and HOVENSA have had and expect to have
    further discussions with the EPA regarding the Petroleum
    Refining Initiative, although both the Registrant and HOVENSA
    have already installed many of the pollution controls required
    of other refiners under the consent agreements. While the effect
    on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot
    be estimated at this time, additional future capital
    expenditures and operating expenses may be incurred. The amount
    of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material to the
    Corporation. Negotiations with EPA are continuing and
    substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter.

On September 13, 2007, HOVENSA received a Notice Of
    Violation (NOV) pursuant to section 113(a)(i) of the Clean
    Air Act (Act) from the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) finding that HOVENSA failed to obtain proper
    permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed
    coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
    HOVENSA believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for
    this project. The NOV states that EPA has authority to issue an
    administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the
    Act. However, HOVENSA intends to enter into discussions with the
    EPA to reach resolution of this matter. Registrant does not
    believe that this matter will result in material liability to
    HOVENSA or Registrant.

In December 2006, HOVENSA received a NOV from the EPA alleging
    non-compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the
    Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources
    (DPNR) for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit.
    The NOV was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and
    submission by HOVENSA regarding potential non-compliance with
    the permit emissions limits for two pollutants. Any exceedances
    were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants
    emitted in excess of the limits. HOVENSA intends to work with
    the appropriate governmental agency to reach resolution of this
    matter and does not believe that it will result in material
    liability.

Registrant is one of over 60 companies that have received a
    directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental
    Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments
    of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking natural
    resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects
    Registrant, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk
    storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by the
    Registrant. Registrant and over 40 companies entered into
    an Administrative Order on Consent with EPA to study the same
    contamination. In June 2007, EPA issued a draft study which
    evaluated six alternatives for early action, with costs ranging
    from $900 million to $2.3 billion. Based on adverse
    comments from Registrant and others, EPA is reevaluating its
    alternatives. In addition, the federal trustees for natural
    resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural
    resources in the Passaic River. Given the ongoing studies,
    remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based
    on currently known facts and circumstances, the Registrant does
    not believe that this matter will result in material liability
    because its terminal could not have contributed contamination
    along most of the river’s length and did not store or use
    contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river
    sediments, and because there are numerous other parties who will
    likely share in the cost of remediation and damages.

In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly
    owned subsidiary of the Registrant, and HOVENSA, each received a
    letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of
    Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees,
    advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit against
    HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
    alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
    damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous
    substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
    currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south
    shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had
    been operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed
    on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands
    against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated
    industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix
    asserting that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and
    territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural
    resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA do not believe that this matter
    will result in a material liability as they believe that they
    have strong defenses to this complaint, and they intend to
    vigorously defend this matter.



Registrant has been served with a complaint from the New York
    State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) relating to
    alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in Brooklyn, New
    York. The complaint, which seeks an order to shut down the
    terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts, alleges
    violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks,
    the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads, petroleum discharges
    and improper certification of tank repairs. DEC is also seeking
    relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in
    the New York metropolitan area. Registrant and DEC have reached
    a settlement in principle, which is expected to be finalized in
    early 2008. Any settlement is not expected to be material to the
    Corporation.

The Registrant periodically receives notices from EPA that it is
    a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
    legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
    this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
    jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
    claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation
    relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With
    respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s claims have been
    settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all
    cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of
    these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private
    parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot
    be predicted at this time due to the large number of other
    potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of

clean-up

cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notified the
    Registrant that on July 21, 2005, it commenced a private
    investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial
    Guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of
    the government of Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC has
    requested documents and information from the Registrant and
    other oil and gas companies that have operations or interests in
    Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC had previously been
    conducting an informal inquiry into such matters. The Registrant
    has been cooperating and continues to cooperate with the SEC
    investigation.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
    and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
    to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of
    these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of
    them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such
    proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of
    the Securities and Exchange Commission. In management’s
    opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances,
    such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material
    adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
    operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P)
    and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment
    explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and
    sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment
    manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.

Net income in 2007 was $1,832 million compared with
    $1,920 million in 2006 and $1,226 million in 2005.
    Diluted earnings per share were $5.74 in 2007 compared with
    $6.08 in 2006 and $3.93 in 2005. A table of items affecting
    comparability between periods is shown on page 21.

Exploration
    and Production

The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to
    profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and
    financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were 1,330 million barrels of oil
    equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2007 compared with
    1,243 million boe at December 31, 2006 and
    1,093 million boe at December 31, 2005. Total proved
    reserves at year end 2007 increased 87 million boe or 7%
    from the end of 2006.

E&P net income was $1,842 million in 2007,
    $1,763 million in 2006 and $1,058 million in 2005. The
    improved results in 2007 as compared to 2006 were primarily
    driven by higher average crude oil selling prices and increased
    crude oil and natural gas production. See further discussion in
    Comparison of Results on page 21.

Production averaged 377,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
    day (boepd) in 2007 compared with 359,000 boepd in 2006 and
    335,000 boepd in 2005. Production in 2007 increased 18,000 boepd
    or 5% from 2006 reflecting the following developments:

•

The Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea (Hess 85%), which
    commenced production in December 2006, exhibited strong
    reservoir performance and facilities uptime during the year. In
    January 2008, production reached design capacity of 60,000
    boepd, gross (approximately 40,000 boepd, net).

•

The Ujung Pangkah Field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia commenced
    natural gas production in April 2007. The Corporation’s net
    share of production from the field ramped up to an average of
    69,000 mcf per day in the fourth quarter of 2007.

•

The Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) natural gas
    fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, which came onstream in
    June 2006, contributed to the Corporation’s year-over-year
    production growth. Production from the Cromarty Field was shut
    in during the summer when natural gas prices were seasonally
    lower and then full production re-commenced in October at higher
    prices.

•

The Corporation benefited from a full year of natural gas
    production from Sinphuhorm (Hess 35%) located onshore Thailand,
    which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2006, and
    from production growth in Azerbaijan and Russia.

•

The Snohvit Field located offshore Norway (Hess 3.26%) commenced
    natural gas production in September 2007 and the Genghis Khan
    Field in the Gulf of Mexico (Hess 28%) started crude oil
    production in October 2007.

In 2008, the Corporation expects total worldwide production of
    approximately 380,000 boepd to 390,000 boepd.

During the year, the Corporation progressed development projects
    that will add to its production in future years:

•

The expansion of offshore facilities and installation of
    wellhead platforms was completed in the fourth quarter at Block

A-18

of the
    Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) (Hess
    50%). Full Phase 2 production is expected in the second half of
    2008.



•

The Shenzi development (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico progressed with the installation of tension leg platform
    tendon piles and hull fabrication. First production is expected
    to commence in

mid-2009.

•

Development of the residual oil zone at the
    Seminole-San Andres Unit (Hess 34.3%) in the Permian Basin
    commenced and is advancing as planned. Production is expected to
    start up in 2009.

•

Development of the Ujung Pangkah crude oil project commenced and
    facilities engineering and construction continue on schedule.
    Production from this Phase 2 oil project is expected to commence
    in 2009.

•

The Jambi Merang natural gas project (Hess 25%) in Indonesia was
    sanctioned during the year.

During 2007, the Corporation’s exploration activities
    included:

•

The Corporation gained access to new exploration acreage
    including two offshore blocks on the Australian Northwest Shelf,
    licenses WA-390-P (Hess 100%) and nearby WA-404-P (Hess 50%)
    with total gross acreage of approximately 1.5 million
    acres. Additionally, more than 125,000 net undeveloped acres
    were added in the Bakken trend of North Dakota.

•

On the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%)
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a sidetrack from the original
    discovery well was successfully completed in the first quarter
    and a second appraisal well is being drilled about
    1.5 miles northwest of the original discovery well.

•

At the Tubular Bells discovery (Hess 20%) on Mississippi Canyon
    Block 682 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a successful
    sidetrack well was completed during the first quarter of 2007
    and a further appraisal well was spud in October 2007.

During 2007, the Corporation completed the following acquisition
    and divestiture transactions:

•

In February 2007, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a
    28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652
    and 608, which is part of the same geological structure as the
    Shenzi development.

•

In the second quarter, interests in the Scott-Telford fields
    located offshore United Kingdom were sold for $93 million
    resulting in an after-tax gain of $15 million
    ($21 million before income taxes). The Corporation’s
    share of production from the Scott-Telford fields was
    approximately 6,500 boepd at the time of sale.

Marketing
    and Refining

The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to
    deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash
    flow. M&R net income was $300 million in 2007,
    $394 million in 2006 and $499 million in 2005.
    Profitability in 2007 and 2006 was adversely affected by lower
    average margins.

Refining operations contributed net income of $193 million
    in 2007, $240 million in 2006 and $330 million in
    2005. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA,
    a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of
    Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), totaling $300 million
    in 2007, $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in
    2005. Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 454,000 barrels
    per day in 2007 compared with 448,000 barrels per day in
    2006 and 461,000 barrels per day in 2005. In 2007, HOVENSA
    successfully completed the first turnaround of its delayed
    coking unit. The Port Reading refinery operated at an average of
    61,000 barrels per day in 2007 versus 63,000 barrels
    per day in 2006 and 55,000 barrels per day in 2005.
    Marketing earnings were $83 million in 2007,
    $108 million in 2006 and $136 million in 2005. Total
    refined product sales volumes averaged 451,000 barrels per
    day in 2007 compared with 459,000 barrels per day in 2006
    and 456,000 barrels per day in 2005.

Liquidity
    and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $3,507 million in 2007, $3,491 million in 2006 and
    $1,840 million in 2005, principally reflecting increasing
    earnings. At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents
    totaled $607 million compared with $383 million at
    December 31, 2006. Total debt was



$3,980 million at December 31, 2007 compared with
    $3,772 million at December 31, 2006. The
    Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at
    December 31, 2007 was 28.9% compared with 31.6% at the end
    of 2006. The Corporation has debt maturities of $62 million
    in 2008 and $143 million in 2009.

In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
    transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
    reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
    after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
    earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
    preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
    they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
    the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
    the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

Amounts differ from E&P
    operating revenues in Note 16 “ Segment
    Information” primarily due to the exclusion of sales of
    hydrocarbons purchased from third parties.



After considering the Exploration and Production items in the
    table on page 21, the remaining changes in Exploration and
    Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in
    selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration
    expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.

Selling prices:

Higher average selling
    prices, primarily crude oil, increased Exploration and
    Production revenues by approximately $740 million in 2007
    compared with 2006. In 2006, the increase in average crude oil
    selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased revenues by
    approximately $1,900 million compared with 2005.

    2007, $285 million ($449 million before income taxes)
    in 2006 and $989 million ($1,582 million before income
    taxes) in 2005.

Production and sales volumes:

The
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was
    377,000 boepd in 2007 compared with 359,000 boepd in 2006 and
    335,000 boepd in 2005. The Corporation anticipates that its 2008
    production will average between 380,000 and 390,000 boepd.



The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as

    converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf
    equals one barrel).

United States:

Crude oil and natural
    gas production was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005,
    principally due to natural decline and asset sales.

Europe:

Crude oil production in 2007
    was lower than in 2006, reflecting natural decline, facilities
    work on three North Sea fields, and the sale of the
    Corporation’s interests in the Scott and Telford fields in
    the United Kingdom. These decreases were partially offset by
    increased production in Russia. Decreased natural gas production
    in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to lower
    nominations related to the shut-down of a non-operated pipeline
    in the North Sea and natural decline, partially offset by higher
    production from the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields in
    the United Kingdom which commenced in June 2006. Production in
    Europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased
    production from Russia and new production from the Atlantic and
    Cromarty fields, which offset lower production due to
    maintenance and natural decline.

Africa:

Crude oil production increased
    in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the

start-up

of
    the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea in December 2006.
    Production in 2006 was higher than 2005 levels, principally due
    to production from Libya, which the Corporation re-entered in
    January 2006.

Asia and other:

Crude oil production
    increased in 2007 versus 2006, reflecting a combination of an
    increased entitlement and higher production in Azerbaijan.
    Higher natural gas production in 2007 compared with 2006 was
    principally due to new production from the Sinphuhorm onshore
    gas project in Thailand which commenced in November 2006 and new
    production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia which
    commenced in April 2007. These increases were partially offset
    by the planned shut-down of the JDA to install facilities
    required for Phase 2 gas sales. Natural gas production was
    higher in 2006 compared with 2005 due to increased production
    from the JDA.

Sales volumes:

Higher sales volumes
    increased revenue by approximately $240 million in 2007
    compared with 2006 and $400 million in 2006 compared with
    2005.

Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and
    amortization:

Cash operating costs,
    consisting of production expenses and general and administrative
    expenses, increased by $409 million in 2007 and
    $322 million in 2006 compared with the corresponding
    amounts in prior years (excluding the charges for



vacated leased office space and hurricane related costs in
    2006). The increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to
    higher production volumes, increased costs of services and
    materials, higher employee costs and increased production taxes.
    Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.36 in
    2007, $10.92 in 2006 and $9.07 in 2005. Cash operating costs in
    2008 are estimated to be in the range of $14.00 to $15.00 per
    barrel of oil equivalent.

Excluding the pre-tax amount of the 2007 asset impairments,
    depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by
    $232 million and $194 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher
    production volumes and per barrel costs. Depreciation, depletion
    and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $10.11
    in 2007, $8.85 in 2006 and $7.88 in 2005. Depreciation,
    depletion and amortization costs for 2008 are expected to be in
    the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel.

Exploration expenses:

Exploration
    expenses were lower in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily
    reflecting lower dry hole costs, partially offset by increased
    costs related to seismic studies. Exploration expenses were
    higher in 2006 compared with 2005, principally reflecting higher
    dry hole costs.

Income taxes:

The effective income tax
    rate for Exploration and Production operations was 50% in 2007,
    53% in 2006 and 41% in 2005. After considering the items in the
    table below, the effective income tax rates were 50% in 2007,
    54% in 2006 and 42% in 2005. The effective income tax rate
    increased beginning in 2006 due to the Corporation’s
    re-entry into Libya and the increase in the supplementary tax on
    petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. The
    effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2008 is
    expected to be in the range of 47% to 51%.

Other:

The after-tax foreign currency
    loss was $7 million in 2007, compared with a gain of
    $10 million in 2006 and $20 million in 2005.

Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the

2007:

The gain from asset sales relates to the
    sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and
    Telford fields located in the United Kingdom North Sea. The
    charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields in the
    United Kingdom North Sea. The pre-tax amount of this charge is
    reflected in depreciation, depletion and amortization. The
    estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge
    for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields,
    which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating
    revenues.

2006:

The gains from asset sales relate to the
    sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties
    located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore
    Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated
    leased office space in the United Kingdom. The related expenses
    are reflected principally in general and administrative
    expenses. The income tax adjustment represents a one-time
    adjustment to the Corporation’s deferred tax liability
    resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum
    operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%.

2005:

The gains from asset sales represent the
    disposal of non-producing properties in the United Kingdom and
    the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased
    interest in the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. The
    Corporation recorded incremental production expenses in 2005,
    principally repair costs and higher insurance



premiums, as a result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico.
    The income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income
    taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax
    settlement in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects
    the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset
    sale, which is recorded in other income in the income statement.

The Corporation’s future Exploration and Production
    earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political
    risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural
    gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation,
    exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in
    foreign exchange and income tax rates.

Marketing
    and Refining

Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to
    $300 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006 and
    $499 million in 2005. After considering the Marketing and
    Refining items in the table on page 21, the earnings
    amounted to $276 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006
    and $475 million in 2005 and are discussed in the
    paragraphs below. The Corporation’s downstream operations
    include its 50% interest in HOVENSA, which is accounted for
    using the equity method. Additional Marketing and Refining
    activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy
    marketing and trading operations.

Refining:

Refining earnings, which
    consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
    results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note
    receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous
    operating activities were $193 million in 2007,
    $240 million in 2006 and $330 million in 2005.

The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s net income was
    $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in
    2007, $124 million ($201 million before income taxes)
    in 2006 and $227 million ($370 million before income
    taxes) in 2005. The lower earnings in 2007 and 2006 compared to
    the respective prior years were principally due to lower
    refining margins. During 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was
    shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled
    turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included
    in this turnaround. In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit
    at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 22 days of
    unscheduled maintenance. During 2005, a crude unit and the fluid
    catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for
    approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance. Cash
    distributions from HOVENSA were $300 million in 2007,
    $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005.

Pre-tax interest income on the PDVSA note was $9 million,
    $15 million and $20 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Interest income is reflected in other income in
    the income statement. At December 31, 2007, the remaining
    balance of the PDVSA note was $76 million, which is
    scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009.

Port Reading’s after-tax earnings were $75 million in
    2007, $104 million in 2006 and $88 million in 2005.
    Refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared with 2006.
    Higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower
    margins in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2005, the Port Reading
    facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance.

Marketing:

Marketing operations, which
    consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing
    activities, generated income of $59 million in 2007,
    $108 million in 2006 and $112 million in 2005,
    excluding income from liquidations of LIFO inventories and the
    charge related to a customer bankruptcy described on
    page 26.



The decreases in 2007 and 2006 primarily reflect lower margins
    on refined product sales. Total refined product sales volumes
    were 451,000 barrels per day in 2007, 459,000 barrels
    per day in 2006 and 456,000 barrels per day in 2005. Total
    energy marketing natural gas sales volumes, including utility
    and spot sales, were approximately 1.9 million mcf per day
    in 2007, 1.8 million mcf per day in 2006 and
    1.7 million mcf per day in 2005. In addition, energy
    marketing sold electricity volumes at the rate of 2,800, 1,400
    and 500 megawatts (round the clock) in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
    derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
    its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
    trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the
    trading partnership, amounted to income of $24 million in
    2007, $46 million in 2006 and $33 million in 2005.

Marketing expenses were comparable in 2007 and 2006, but
    increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due to higher expenses
    from an increased number of retail convenience stores, growth in
    energy marketing operations and increased utility and
    compensation related costs.

Reported Marketing and Refining earnings include the following
    items of income (expense) before and after income taxes:

In 2007 and 2005, Marketing and Refining earnings include income
    from the  liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories. In 2005,
    Marketing and Refining earnings also include a charge resulting
    from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility industry, which
    is included in marketing expenses.

The Corporation’s future Marketing and Refining earnings
    may be impacted by volatility in margins, competitive industry
    conditions, government regulatory changes, credit risk and
    supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather.

Excluding the items affecting comparability between periods, the
    increase in corporate expenses in 2007 compared with 2006
    primarily reflects higher employee related costs, including
    stock-based compensation. The increase in corporate expenses in
    2006 compared with 2005 principally reflects the expensing of
    stock options



commencing January 1, 2006 and increases in insurance
    costs. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses in 2008 are
    estimated to be in the range of $130 to $140 million.

In 2007, Corporate expenses include a charge of $25 million
    ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE
    litigation. The pre-tax amount of this charge is recorded in
    general and administrative expenses. In 2005, the American Jobs
    Creation Act provided for a one-time reduction in the income tax
    rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible dividends from
    foreign subsidiaries to a United States parent. The Corporation
    repatriated $1.9 billion of previously unremitted foreign
    earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision
    of $72 million. The pre-tax amount of bond repurchase
    premiums in 2005 was $39 million, which was recorded in
    other income in the income statement.

The decrease in capitalized interest in 2007 reflects the
    completion of several development projects in 2007 and the
    latter portion of 2006. After-tax interest expense in 2008 is
    expected to be in the range of $165 to $175 million,
    principally reflecting lower capitalized interest.

Sales
    and Other Operating Revenues

Sales and other operating revenues totaled $31,647 million
    in 2007, an increase of 13% compared with 2006. The increase
    reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of crude oil,
    higher refined product selling prices and increased sales
    volumes in electricity. In 2006, sales and other operating
    revenues totaled $28,067 million, an increase of 23%
    compared with 2005. The increase reflects higher selling prices
    of crude oil, higher sales volumes and reduced crude oil hedge
    positions in Exploration and Production activities and higher
    selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities.

The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally
    reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined
    products and purchased natural gas and electricity.

    Mexico for $371 million. In 2006, capital expenditures
    included payments of $359 million to

re-enter

the
    Corporation’s former oil and gas production operations in
    the Waha concessions in Libya and $413 million to acquire a
    55% working interest in the West Med Block in Egypt.

In 2007 the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million
    for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields
    located in the United Kingdom. Proceeds from asset sales in 2006
    totaled $444 million, including the sale of the
    Corporation’s interests in certain producing properties in
    the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast. Proceeds
    from asset sales were $74 million in 2005, principally from
    the sale of non-producing properties.

Financing Activities:

During 2007, net
    borrowings were $208 million. The Corporation reduced debt
    by $13 million in 2006 and $50 million in 2005. In
    2005, bond repurchases of $600 million were funded by
    borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with
    the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States.

Common stock dividends paid were $127 million in 2007.
    Total common and preferred stock dividends paid were
    $161 million in 2006 and $159 million in 2005. The
    Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock
    options totaling $110 million, $40 million and
    $62 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Future
    Capital Requirements and Resources

The Corporation anticipates $4.4 billion in capital and
    exploratory expenditures in 2008, of which $4.3 billion
    relates to Exploration and Production operations. The
    Corporation has maturities of long-term debt of $62 million
    in 2008 and $143 million in 2009. The Corporation
    anticipates that it can fund its 2008 operations, including
    capital



expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt
    repayments, with existing cash on-hand, projected cash flow from
    operations and its available credit facilities.

The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated,
    revolving credit facility (the facility), substantially all of
    which is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used
    for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2007,
    outstanding borrowings under the facility were $220 million
    and additional available borrowing capacity under the facility
    was $2,780 million.

The Corporation has a

364-day

asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts
    receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations, which are
    sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this
    financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow
    up to $800 million, subject to the availability of
    sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31,
    2007, the Corporation had $250 million in outstanding
    borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of
    $534 million which were collateralized by
    $1,336 million of Marketing and Refining accounts
    receivable. These receivables are not available to pay the
    general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of
    outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed facility.

At December 31, 2007, $600 million of outstanding
    borrowings under short-term credit facilities are classified as
    long term based on the Corporation’s available capacity
    under the committed revolving credit facility. These borrowings
    consist of the $250 million under the asset-backed credit
    facility described above, $300 million under a short-term
    committed facility and $50 million under uncommitted lines
    at December 31, 2007. The Corporation also has a shelf
    registration under which it may issue additional debt
    securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.

Outstanding letters of credit at December 31, were as
    follows:

A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporation’s debt
    to equity ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an
    additional $12.3 billion for the construction or
    acquisition of assets at December 31, 2007. The Corporation
    has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.6 billion
    of secured debt at December 31, 2007 under the loan
    agreement covenants.

Credit
    Ratings

There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the
    Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently
    assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporation’s
    debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on the
    Corporation’s borrowing arrangements and margin
    requirements from non-trading and trading counterparties are
    subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating
    changes.

At December 31, 2007, the
    Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average
    rate of 7.0%.

(b)

The Corporation intends to
    continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA.
    Estimated future purchases amount to approximately
    $7.0 billion annually using year-end 2007 prices.

In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
    commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
    HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
    sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future
    supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market
    prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA,
    and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included
    are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional
    gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail
    marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
    facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to
    purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity for use
    in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing
    business. These commitments were computed based on year-end
    market prices.

The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including a
    portion of the Corporation’s planned $4.4 billion
    capital investment program for 2008, that is contractually
    committed at December 31, 2007. Obligations for operating
    expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic
    purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal
    business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect
    contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2007, including asset retirement obligations,
    pension plan funding requirements and anticipated obligations
    for uncertain income tax positions.

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline
    stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets
    for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating
    leases. During 2007, the Corporation entered into a lease
    agreement for a new drillship and related support services for
    use in its global deepwater exploration and development
    activities beginning in the middle of 2009. The total payments
    under this five year contract will approximate $950 million.

The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring
    in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a
    retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately
    $150 million as of December 31, 2007.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
    HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
    PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates
    based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices
    and at December 31, 2007 amounted to $277 million. In
    addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a
    maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have
    funds to meet its senior debt obligations.

At December 31, 2007, the Corporation has issued
    $2,978 million of letters of credit principally relating to
    accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties
    recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the



Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and
    under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related
    to its business, as follows:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance
    sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
    Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is
    $493 million at December 31, 2007 compared with
    $490 million at December 31, 2006. The
    Corporation’s December 31, 2007 debt to capitalization
    ratio would increase from 28.9% to 31.4% if these leases were
    included as debt.

    financial statements.

Stock
    Split

On May 3, 2006, the Corporation’s shareholders voted
    to increase the number of authorized common shares from
    200 million to 600 million and the board of directors
    declared a three-for-one stock split. The stock split was
    completed in the form of a stock dividend that was issued on
    May 31, 2006. The common share par value remained at $1.00
    per share. All common share and per share amounts in the
    financial statements and notes and management’s discussion
    and analysis are on an after-split basis for all periods
    presented.

Foreign
    Operations

The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities
    principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark,
    Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya,
    Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the
    United States. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the
    risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures
    include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency
    risk.

HOVENSA owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin
    Islands. In 2002, there was a political disruption in Venezuela
    that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in
    refining operations; however, this disruption did not have a
    material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial
    position. The Corporation has a note receivable of
    $76 million at December 31, 2007 from a subsidiary of
    PDVSA. All payments are current and the Corporation anticipates
    collection of the remaining balance.

Accounting
    Policies

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
    assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
    accounting methods used can affect net income,
    stockholders’ equity and various financial statement
    ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies
    generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration



expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
    after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
    producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if
    there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational
    viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged
    to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing
    reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project
    include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations
    for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with
    governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for
    additional drilling and other factors.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:

The
    determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant
    element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration
    and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves
    affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation
    rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as
    impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
    accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
    requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
    reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
    producible, government and project operator approvals must be
    obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost,
    senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund
    the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve
    estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent
    third party reserve determination as well as internal technical
    appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own
    internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical
    staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The
    Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates
    throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells,
    performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To
    provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve
    estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and
    approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are
    subject to internal technical audits and senior management
    reviews the estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary
    Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 69

Disclosures about Oil
    and Gas Producing Activities

(FAS No. 69) are
    determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and
    MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal
    estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with
    engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production
    histories and other information necessary for the reserve
    determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s
    technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information
    provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review
    the final reserve estimates issued by D&M.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
    Goodwill:

As explained below there are
    significant differences in the way long-lived assets and
    goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas
    fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable
    cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are
    largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and
    liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets
    are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash
    flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss
    is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated
    fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting
    anticipated future net cash flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
    net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
    future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
    historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
    projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted
    at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected
    production volumes represent reserves, including probable
    reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount
    of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and
    timing of production are consistent with internal projections
    and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices
    used for determining asset impairments will generally differ
    from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future
    net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use
    of actual prices on the last day of the year.



The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived
    Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its
    best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery
    factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the
    timing of future production and other factors, which are updated
    each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could
    have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil
    and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling
    prices decline significantly for an extended period or future
    estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.

In accordance with FAS No. 142

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

(FAS No. 142), the
    Corporation’s goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for
    impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit
    level, which is an operating segment or one level below an
    operating segment. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate
    and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily
    from the manner in which the business is managed. The
    Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and
    Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of
    goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment.

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the Exploration
    and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted
    anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known
    developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value
    of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium
    to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential
    synergies including cost savings, access to new business
    opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and
    increased market share. The Corporation also considers the
    relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production
    companies.

The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and
    Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and
    gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and
    market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and
    natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a
    decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production
    operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived
    assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
    testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
    would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the
    Exploration and Production segment.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation
    recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset
    retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any
    legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is
    recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
    Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the
    carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which
    the liability is incurred. In order to measure these
    obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the
    obligations by discounting the future payments that will be
    required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these
    estimates, the Corporation is required to make several
    assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement,
    timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements,
    inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are
    other external factors which could significantly affect the
    ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including:
    changes in environmental regulations and other statutory
    requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign
    currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result,
    the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations
    are subject to revision due to the factors described above.
    Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments
    to both the liability and related asset values.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading
    activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In
    trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a
    consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and
    derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps,
    based on expectations of future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under
    FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in



earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected
    future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges)
    or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective
    portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of
    other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow
    hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that
    the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
    portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in
    fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are
    recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of
    the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to
    its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.

Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair
    value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before
    they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on
    an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify
    for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective
    effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical
    simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical
    observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot
    prices.

Income Taxes:

Judgments are required in
    the determination and recognition of income tax assets and
    liabilities in the financial statements. These judgements
    include the requirement to only recognize the financial
    statement effect of a tax position when management believes that
    it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits,
    the position will be sustained upon examination.

The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several
    jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded
    deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the
    Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences
    between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and
    liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood
    of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more
    likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
    not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the
    deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be
    realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets,
    the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary
    differences, available carryforward periods for net operating
    losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of
    tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and
    other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on
    assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are
    consistent with the Corporation’s internal business
    forecasts. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations.

Changes
    in Accounting Policies

Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP)
    AUG AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance
    Activities.

This FSP eliminated the previously acceptable

accrue-in-advance

method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As a result,
    the Corporation retrospectively changed its method of accounting
    to recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when
    such costs are incurred. The impact of adopting this FSP
    increased previously reported 2006 earnings by $4 million
    ($.01 per diluted share). In addition, previously reported
    2005 net income decreased by $16 million ($.05 per
    diluted share) and retained earnings as of January 1, 2005
    increased by approximately $48 million. All 2007, 2006 and
    2005 financial information reflects this retrospective
    accounting change.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted the
    provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(FIN 48). FIN 48
    prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement
    criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
    tax return. FIN 48 also requires additional disclosures
    related to uncertain income tax positions. See Note 11,
    “Income Taxes” for further information.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standard

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(FAS No. 157).
    FAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and requires disclosure of a fair value hierarchy, which
    applies to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair
    value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements. The
    standard also requires additional disclosure about the methods
    of determining fair value. The Corporation as



required, will prospectively adopt the provisions of
    FAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008. The
    Corporation believes that the impact of adopting
    FAS No. 157 on net income will not be material. In
    addition, the Corporation expects to record a reduction in the
    after-tax charge reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
    income relating to the crude oil hedging program of
    approximately $160 million, after income taxes.

Environment,
    Health and Safety

The Corporation has implemented a values-based,
    socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment,
    health and safety performance and making a positive impact on
    communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s
    environment, health, safety and social responsibility
    (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety
    management systems that help protect the Corporation’s
    workforce, customers and local communities. The
    Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or
    exceed international standards and are intended to promote
    internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and
    continual improvement in EHS & SR performance.
    Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the
    Corporation’s operating costs and could also require
    increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to
    assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to
    enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity
    and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral
    benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation
    has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit
    facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and
    emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR
    goals.

The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and
    elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent
    years. In 2006, additional regulations to reduce the allowable
    sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect. Additional
    reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under
    consideration. Fuels production will likely continue to be
    subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such
    may require additional capital expenditures. The Energy Policy
    Act of 2005 imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific
    quantities of renewable content in gasoline. The 2007 Energy
    Policy Act expanded requirements on the use of renewable content
    and included several technology forcing provisions. Many states
    have also enacted or are considering biofuels mandates, which,
    in combination with national legislation may affect the
    Registrant’s markets for fuels.

As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in
    2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the
    U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining
    Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed
    to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries.
    Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing
    these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control
    over 80% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with
    the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these
    discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience
    increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to
    air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow
    for controls to be phased in over several years.

The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and
    reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including
    carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this
    program are significant, not only from the standpoint of
    technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of
    adequately measuring the Corporation’s greenhouse gas
    inventory. The Corporation has completed a revised monitoring
    protocol which will allow for better measurement of
    “greenhouse gases” and has completed an independently
    verified audit of its emissions. The monitoring protocol in
    conjunction with the Corporation’s recently formulated
    Climate Change Network will allow for better control of these
    emissions and assist the Corporation in developing policies and
    programs to reduce these emissions and comply with any future
    regulatory restrictions.

The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for
    environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to
    existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be
    necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore
    exploration and production facilities, refineries (including
    solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to
    the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not
    currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the
    Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party.

The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
    remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable. At year-end 2007, the Corporation’s
    reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was
    approximately $60 million. The Corporation expects that
    existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately
    cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The
    Corporation’s remediation spending



was $23 million in 2007 and $15 million in 2006 and
    2005. Capital expenditures incurred over several years to comply
    with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements totaled
    approximately $400 million at HOVENSA and approximately
    $70 million at Port Reading. Capital expenditures for
    facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local
    environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur
    requirements, were $22 million in 2007 and 2006 and
    $3 million in 2005.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including
    references to the Corporation’s future results of
    operations and financial position, liquidity and capital
    resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax
    rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and
    environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and
    contractual obligations and contingencies include
    forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are
    based on the Corporation’s current understanding and
    assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about
    the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures
    because of changes in market conditions, government actions and
    other factors.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
    to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
    natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
    changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
    disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as
    non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading
    operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a
    trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to
    commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil,
    natural gas and refined products. The following describes how
    these risks are controlled and managed.

Controls:

The Corporation maintains a
    control environment under the direction of its chief risk
    officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the
    Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls
    include volumetric, term and

value-at-risk

limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use
    of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored
    daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to
    senior management. The Corporation’s risk management
    department also performs independent verifications of sources of
    fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls
    apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading
    activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The
    Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for
    administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging
    programs.

Instruments:

The Corporation primarily
    uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward
    contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based
    securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These
    contracts are generally widely traded instruments with
    standardized terms. The following describes these instruments
    and how the Corporation uses them:

•

Forward Commodity Contracts:

The Corporation
    enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of
    commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the
    contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity.
    Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and
    sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the
    quantitative market risk disclosures.

•

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:

Forward
    contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the
    British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign
    currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed
    amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange
    rate on a certain date.

•

Exchange Traded Contracts:

The Corporation
    uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number
    of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are
    settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to
    exchange position limits.

•

Swaps:

The Corporation uses financially
    settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging
    and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are
    determined based on underlying commodity prices and are
    typically settled over the life of the contract.



•

Options:

Options on various underlying energy
    commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts
    and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the
    Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk
    of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying
    the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a
    premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the
    favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These
    premiums are a component of the fair value of the options.

•

Energy Securities:

Energy securities include
    energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or
    government or related derivatives on these securities.

Value-at-Risk:

The
    Corporation uses

value-at-risk

to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and
    non-trading activities. The

value-at-risk

model uses historical simulation and the results represent the
    potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence
    level. The model captures both first and second order
    sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the

value-at-risk

results for trading and non-trading activities. These results
    may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading
    activities or hedging levels change in non-trading activities.

Non-trading:

The Corporation’s
    non-trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and
    natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the
    selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future
    production and the related gains or losses are an integral part
    of the Corporation’s selling prices. Following is a summary
    of the Corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at

There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production
    at December 31, 2007. As market conditions change, the
    Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. The Corporation
    also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum
    products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses
    futures, swaps and options to manage the risk in its marketing
    activities.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
    December 31, 2007 includes after-tax unrealized deferred
    losses of $1,672 million primarily related to crude oil
    contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales.
    The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in
    accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are
    recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.



The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
    exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
    forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling
    and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2007, the
    Corporation had $977 million of notional value foreign
    exchange contracts maturing in 2008. The fair value of the
    foreign exchange contracts was a payable of $1 million at
    December 31, 2007. The change in fair value of the foreign
    exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is
    estimated to be approximately $100 million at
    December 31, 2007.

The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,980 million
    has a fair value of $4,263 million at December 31,
    2007. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the
    fair value of debt by approximately $200 million at
    December 31, 2007.

Trading:

In trading activities, the
    Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and
    refined product prices. The trading partnership in which the
    Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities,
    securities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are
    consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also
    takes trading positions for its own account. The information
    that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the
    Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.

Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
    the time of sale. Total realized gains on trading activities for
    2007 amounted to $303 million ($721 million in 2006).
    Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market and
    unrealized gains or losses are reflected in income currently.
    The following table provides an assessment of the factors
    affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and
    represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading
    activities.

The Corporation uses observable market values for determining
    the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where
    actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources
    are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in
    actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets
    and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are
    based on internal models incorporating underlying market
    information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The
    Corporation’s risk management department regularly compares
    valuations to independent sources and models.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
    as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
    on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness
    of the Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, as stated in their
    report, which is included herein.

Hess Corporation

We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007 based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related statements of consolidated income, cash flows,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income of Hess
    Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007, and our report
    dated February 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related statements of
    consolidated income, cash flows, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the
    Financial Statement Schedule listed in the Index at Item 8.
    These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
    of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related Financial Statement Schedule, when considered in
    relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Corporation adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP)
    AUG AIR-1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities,
    and FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes, effective January 1, 2007. As discussed in
    Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Corporation adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
    effective December 31, 2006. Also, as discussed in
    Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1,
    2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Hess Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:

Hess Corporation
    and subsidiaries (the Corporation) engage in the exploration for
    and the development, production, purchase, transportation and
    sale of crude oil and natural gas. These activities are
    conducted principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil,
    Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia,
    Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom
    and the United States. In addition, the Corporation
    manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined
    petroleum and other energy products. The Corporation owns 50% of
    HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a refinery joint venture in the United
    States Virgin Islands. An additional refining facility,
    terminals and retail gasoline stations, most of which include
    convenience stores, are located on the East Coast of the United
    States.

In preparing financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
    management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses in the income statement. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Among the estimates
    made by management are oil and gas reserves, asset valuations,
    depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental
    obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes.

Principles of Consolidation:

The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess
    Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
    a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
    The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
    and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
    consolidated.

Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned, including
    HOVENSA, are stated at cost of acquisition plus the
    Corporation’s equity in undistributed net income since
    acquisition. The Corporation consolidates the trading
    partnership in which it owns a 50% voting interest and over
    which it exercises control.

Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
    consolidation.

Revenue Recognition:

The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas,
    petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to
    the customer. Sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes
    in the consolidated statement of income. The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas
    properties based on sales to customers. Differences between
    natural gas volumes sold and the Corporation’s share of
    natural gas production are not material. Revenues from natural
    gas and electricity sales by the Corporation’s marketing
    operations are recognized based on meter readings and estimated
    deliveries to customers since the last meter reading.

In its exploration and production activities, the Corporation
    enters into crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the
    same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one
    another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality.
    Similarly, in its marketing activities, the Corporation also
    enters into refined product purchase and sale transactions with
    the same counterparty. These arrangements are reported net in
    sales and other operating revenues in the consolidated statement
    of income.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading
    activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices
    of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading
    activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated
    partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives, including
    futures, forwards, options and swaps based on expectations of
    future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under
    FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in earnings.
    Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash
    flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of
    firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of
    changes in fair value of



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded
    as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for
    cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same
    period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The
    ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in
    earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The
    change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is
    recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized
    currently in earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
    equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are
    readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three
    months or less when acquired.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at
    the lower of cost or market. For refined product inventories
    valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) inventory method. For the remaining
    inventories, cost is generally determined using average actual
    costs.

Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. In accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position

19-1,

Accounting for Suspended Well Costs

, which amended
    FAS No. 19,

Financial Accounting and Reporting by
    Oil and Gas Producing Companies

(FAS No. 19),
    exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is
    completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity
    of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and
    (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the
    reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
    project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is
    substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of
    a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense.
    Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the
    economic and operating viability of a project include commitment
    of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts
    with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and
    contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other
    factors.

Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization:

The Corporation records
    depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties
    using the units of production method over proved oil and gas
    reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas
    production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of
    production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves.
    Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on
    the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Retail
    gas stations and equipment related to a leased property, are
    depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed the
    remaining lease period. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped
    oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other
    factors.

Capitalized Interest:

Interest from
    external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using
    the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the
    project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
    use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from
    the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful
    lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of
    the underlying assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. The Corporation
    accounts for asset retirement obligations as required by
    FAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations

and FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.

Under these standards, a liability is recognized for the
    fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations
    associated with long-lived assets in the period in which the
    retirement obligations are incurred. In addition, the fair value
    of any legally required conditional



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be
    reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes the associated
    asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the
    long-lived assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas
    properties at a field level, for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may
    not be recovered. If the carrying amounts are not expected to be
    recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the assets are
    impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
    impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
    generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash
    flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the net present value
    of future cash flows is based on management’s best estimate
    of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
    historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
    projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted
    at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected
    production volumes represent reserves, including probable
    reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount
    of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and
    timing of production are consistent with internal projections
    and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices
    used for determining asset impairments will generally differ
    from the year-end prices used in the standardized measure of
    discounted future net cash flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The
    Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    other than temporary decline in value has occurred. The amount
    of the impairment is based on quoted market prices, where
    available, or other valuation techniques.

Impairment of Goodwill:

In accordance
    with FAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

, goodwill is not amortized; however, it is tested for
    impairment annually in the fourth quarter. This impairment test
    is calculated at the reporting unit level, which is the
    Exploration and Production operating segment for the
    Corporation’s goodwill. The Corporation identifies
    potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the
    reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the
    fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount,
    goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair
    value, the Corporation calculates the possible impairment loss
    by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the
    carrying amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less
    than the carrying amount, an impairment would be recorded.

Maintenance and Repairs:

Maintenance
    and repairs are expensed as incurred, including costs of
    refinery turnarounds. Capital improvements are recorded as
    additions in property, plant and equipment.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP)
    AUG AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance
    Activities.

This FSP eliminated the previously acceptable

accrue-in-advance

method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As required,
    the Corporation retrospectively applied the provisions of this
    FSP which resulted in a change of its method of accounting to
    recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when
    such costs are incurred. The impact of adopting this FSP
    increased previously reported 2006 earnings by $4 million
    ($.01 per diluted share). In addition, previously reported
    2005 net income decreased by $16 million ($.05 per
    diluted share) and retained earnings as of January 1, 2005
    increased by approximately $48 million. All prior period
    amounts in the consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes reflect this retrospective accounting change.

Environmental Expenditures:

The
    Corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs to
    remediate existing conditions related to past operations when
    the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The
    Corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase
    the life or efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent
    future adverse impacts to the environment.

Share-Based Compensation:

All
    share-based compensation is expensed and recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. Prior
    to the adoption of FAS No. 123R,

Share-Based
    Payment

, on January 1, 2006, the Corporation recorded
    compensation expense for restricted common stock awards and used
    the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock
    options. The Corporation used the modified prospective
    application method for its adoption of FAS No. 123R,
    which requires that compensation cost be recorded for



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

restricted stock, previously awarded unvested stock options
    outstanding at January 1, 2006 based on the grant date
    fair-values used for disclosure purposes under previous
    accounting requirements, and stock options awarded subsequent to
    January 1, 2006 determined under the provisions of
    FAS No. 123R.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are
    determined using the liability method. The Corporation regularly
    assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on
    estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax
    planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the
    available carryforward periods for net operating losses and
    other factors.

The Corporation adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48 (FIN-48) on January 1, 2007. The impact of
    adoption was not material to the Corporation’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. A deferred tax
    asset of $28 million related to an acquired net operating
    loss carryforward was recorded in accordance with FIN 48
    and goodwill was reduced. In addition, effective with its
    adoption of FIN-48, the Corporation recognizes the financial
    statement effect of a tax position only when management believes
    that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical
    merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The
    Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes
    applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The
    Corporation classifies interest and penalties associated with
    uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The
    U.S. dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in
    which business is conducted) for most foreign operations.
    Adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and
    liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency
    into the functional currency are recorded in other income. For
    operations that do not use the U.S. dollar as the
    functional currency, adjustments resulting from translating
    foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars
    are recorded in a separate component of stockholders’
    equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Recently Issued Accounting Standard:

In
    September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157,

Fair
    Value Measurements

(FAS No. 157).
    FAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and requires disclosure of a fair value hierarchy, which
    applies to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair
    value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements. The
    standard also requires additional disclosure about the methods
    of determining fair value. The Corporation as required, will
    prospectively adopt the provisions of FAS No. 157
    effective January 1, 2008. The Corporation believes that
    the impact of adopting FAS No. 157 on net income will
    not be material. In addition, the Corporation expects to record
    a reduction in the charge reflected in accumulated other
    comprehensive income relating to the Corporation’s crude
    oil hedging program of approximately $160 million, after
    income taxes.

2.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

2007:

In February 2007, the Corporation
    completed the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan
    oil and gas development located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico
    on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and 608 for $371 million,
    of which $342 million was allocated to proved and unproved
    properties and the remainder to wells and equipment. The Genghis
    Khan development is part of the same geologic structure as the
    Shenzi development. This transaction was accounted for as an
    acquisition of assets.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Corporation completed the
    sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in
    the United Kingdom for $93 million and recorded a gain of
    $21 million ($15 million after income taxes). At the
    time of sale, these two fields were producing at a combined net
    rate of 6,500 barrels of oil per day.

2006:

In January 2006, the Corporation,
    in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, re-entered its
    former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions
    in Libya, in which the Corporation holds an 8.16% interest. The
    re-entry terms included a

25-year

extension of the concessions and payments by the Corporation to
    the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $359 million. This
    transaction was accounted for as a business combination.

The goodwill recorded in this transaction relates to the
    deferred tax liability recorded for the difference in book and
    tax bases of the assets acquired. The goodwill is not expected
    to be deductible for income tax purposes. The primary reason for
    the Libyan investment was to acquire long-lived crude oil
    reserves.

The Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater
    section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the
    West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation
    has a

25-year

development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four
    existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
    opportunities. This transaction was accounted for as an
    acquisition of assets.

In the first quarter of 2006, the Corporation completed the sale
    of its interests in certain oil and gas producing properties
    located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico for
    $358 million. This asset sale resulted in an after-tax gain
    of $186 million ($289 million before income taxes).
    These assets were producing at a combined net rate of
    approximately 5,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day at
    the time of sale. In June 2006, the Corporation also completed
    the sale of certain U.S. Gulf Coast onshore oil and gas
    producing assets for $86 million, resulting in an after-tax
    gain of $50 million ($80 million before income taxes).
    These assets were producing at a combined net rate of
    approximately 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day at
    the time of sale.

    2005 the Corporation reduced LIFO inventories, which are carried
    at lower costs than current inventory costs. The effect of the
    LIFO inventory liquidations was to decrease cost of products
    sold by approximately $38 million in 2007 ($24 million
    after income taxes) and $51 million in 2005
    ($32 million after income taxes).

The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of
    $300 million, $400 million and $275 million
    during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Corporation’s
    share of HOVENSA’s undistributed income aggregated
    $220 million at December 31, 2007.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value
    of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
    PDVSA. The guarantee amounted to $277 million at
    December 31, 2007. This amount fluctuates based on the
    volume of crude oil purchased and the related crude oil prices.
    In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to
    a current maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does
    not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations.

At formation of the joint venture in 1999, PDVSA V.I., a

At December 31, 2007, the Corporation’s fixed rate
    debentures have a principal amount of $2,816 million
    ($2,802 million net of unamortized discount). Interest
    rates on the outstanding fixed rate debentures have a weighted
    average rate of 7.3%.

The Corporation has a $3.0 billion syndicated revolving
    credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings
    and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed
    through May 2012. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation has
    available capacity on the facility of $2,780 million.
    Current borrowings under the facility bear interest at 0.525%
    above the London Interbank Offered Rate and a facility fee of
    0.125% per annum is payable on the amount of the credit line.
    The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if
    the Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation has a

364-day

asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts
    receivable from its marketing operations, which are sold to a
    wholly-owned subsidiary. This asset-backed funding arrangement
    allows the Corporation to borrow up to $800 million subject
    to sufficient levels of eligible receivables. The credit line
    matures in October 2008. Borrowings under the asset-backed
    credit facility represent floating rate debt for which the
    weighted average interest rate was 5.6% for 2007. At
    December 31, 2007, total collateralized accounts receivable
    of $1,336 million are serviced by the Corporation and
    recorded on its balance sheet but are not available to pay the
    general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of
    outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed facility.

At December 31, 2007, the Corporation classified an
    aggregate of $600 million of borrowings under short-term
    credit facilities as long term debt, based on the available
    capacity under the $3.0 billion syndicated revolving credit
    facility. These borrowings consist of $300 million under a
    short-term committed facility, $250 million under the
    asset-backed credit facility and $50 million under
    uncommitted lines at December 31, 2007.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a
    financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings
    and secured debt. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation is
    permitted to borrow up to an additional $12.3 billion for
    the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has
    the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.6 billion of
    secured debt at December 31, 2007.

The total amount of interest paid (net of amounts capitalized),
    principally on short-term and long-term debt, was
    $257 million, $200 million and $245 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Corporation capitalized
    interest of $50 million, $100 million and
    $80 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2005,
    the Corporation recorded charges of $39 million
    ($26 million after income taxes) for premiums on bond
    repurchases, which are reflected in other income in the income
    statement.

    terms of the options. The expected stock option term is based on
    historical exercise patterns and the expected future holding
    period.

Retirement
    Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plans for a significant portion of its employees. In
    addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
    plan covering certain employees. The unfunded supplemental
    pension plan provides for incremental pension payments from the
    Corporation so that total pension payments equal amounts that
    would have been payable from the Corporation’s principal
    pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax
    regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years
    of service and final average salary. Additionally, the
    Corporation maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan
    that provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from
    ages 55 through 65. The Corporation uses December 31 as the
    measurement date for all of these retirement plans.

Effective December 31, 2006, the Corporation prospectively
    adopted FAS No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting For
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(FAS No. 158), which required recognition on the
    balance sheet of the underfunded status of a defined benefit
    postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair
    value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The benefit
    obligation is defined as the projected benefit obligation for
    pension plans and the accumulated postretirement obligation for
    postretirement medical plans. The Corporation recognizes on the
    balance sheet all changes in the funded status of its defined
    benefit postretirement plans in the year in which such changes
    occur. As a result of adopting FAS 158, the Corporation
    recorded an after-

Prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of
    10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value
    of assets are amortized over the average remaining service
    period of active employees.

The Corporation’s 2008 pension and postretirement medical
    expense is estimated to be approximately $65 million, of
    which approximately $15 million relates to the amortization
    of estimated actuarial losses.

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used by the

The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for

    while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were
    established at each year-end. The net periodic benefit cost and
    the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on
    actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The
    discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high-quality,
    fixed-income debt instruments with maturities that approximate
    the expected payment of plan obligations. The overall

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected
    future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target
    allocation of pension assets to that asset category.

The Corporation’s investment strategy is to maximize
    returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad
    diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes.
    Asset classes and target allocations are determined by the
    Company’s investment committee and include domestic and
    foreign equities, fixed income securities, and other
    investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private
    equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in
    securities issued by the Corporation unless indirectly held as
    part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets are
    highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment
    requirements.

The Corporation has budgeted contributions of approximately

    Corporation also has budgeted contributions of approximately
    $25 million to the trust established for the unfunded plan.

Estimated future benefit payments for the funded and unfunded

    reflect expected future service, are as follows:

The Corporation also contributes to several defined contribution
    plans for eligible employees. Employees may contribute a portion
    of their compensation to the plans and the Corporation matches a
    portion of the employee contributions. The Corporation recorded
    expense of $19 million in 2007, $16 million in 2006
    and $14 million in 2005 for contributions to these plans.

The effective income tax rate is impacted by the amount of
    income before income taxes earned within the various taxing
    jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates. Additionally,
    the increase in the 2006 effective income tax rate was primarily
    due to taxes on Libyan operations and the increase in the
    supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom
    from 10% to 20%. As a result of the increase in the United
    Kingdom supplementary tax on petroleum operations, the
    Corporation recorded a $45 million adjustment to its United
    Kingdom deferred tax liability in 2006.

The American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) provided for a one-time
    reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of
    eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a
    U.S. parent. During 2005, the Corporation repatriated
    $1.9 billion of foreign dividends under the Act and
    recorded a related income tax provision of approximately
    $72 million.

Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits (millions of dollars):

At December 31, 2007, the unrecognized tax benefits include
    $92 million which, if recognized, would affect the
    Corporation’s effective income tax rate. Over the next
    12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount
    of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to
    $18 million due to settlements with taxing authorities.

The Corporation has not recorded deferred income taxes
    applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations. The Corporation had undistributed earnings from
    foreign subsidiaries of approximately $6.7 billion at
    December 31, 2007. If the earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    were not indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
    approximately $2.3 billion would be required, excluding the
    potential use of foreign tax credits in the United States.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in
    the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The
    Corporation is no longer subject to examinations by income tax
    authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2002.

Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2007, 2006 and 2005
    amounted to $1,826 million, $1,799 million and
    $1,139 million, respectively. Approximately $2 million
    of interest and penalties were accrued during the year. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Corporation had approximately

Financial
    Instruments, Non-trading and Trading Activities

Non-trading:

The Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Hedging activities decreased Exploration and Production revenues
    by $399 million in 2007, $449 million in 2006 and
    $1,582 million in 2005. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness
    gains (losses) reflected in revenue in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $6 million, $(5) million and $(17) million,
    respectively.

The Corporation’s crude oil hedging activities included the
    use of commodity futures and swap contracts. At

The Corporation had no WTI crude oil or natural gas hedges at
    year-end 2007. The Corporation also markets energy commodities
    including refined petroleum products, natural gas and
    electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to manage
    the underlying risk in its marketing activities.

At December 31, 2007, net after tax deferred losses in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from the
    Corporation’s hedging contracts were $1,672 million
    ($2,629 million before income taxes). At December 31,
    2006, net after-tax deferred losses were $1,338 million
    ($2,101 million before income taxes). The pre-tax amount of
    all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and
    the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax
    assets on the balance sheet.

Commodity Trading:

The Corporation,
    principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy
    commodities, securities and derivatives including futures,
    forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future
    market conditions. The Corporation’s income before income
    taxes from trading activities, including its share of the
    earnings of the trading partnership amounted to $49 million
    in 2007, $83 million in 2006 and $60 million in 2005.

    under the contracts. The fair value of the foreign currency
    forward contracts recorded by the Corporation was a payable of
    $1 million at December 31, 2007 and a receivable of
    $51 million at December 31, 2006.

The Corporation has $3,039 million in letters of credit
    outstanding at December 31, 2007 ($3,479 million at
    December 31, 2006). Of the total letters of credit
    outstanding at December 31, 2007, $61 million relates
    to contingent liabilities and the remaining $2,978 million
    relates to liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.

Fair Value Disclosure:

The Corporation
    estimates the fair value of its fixed-rate notes receivable and
    debt generally using discounted cash flow analysis based on
    current interest rates for instruments with similar maturities
    and risk profiles. Foreign currency exchange contracts are
    valued based on current termination values or quoted market
    prices of comparable contracts. The Corporation’s valuation
    of commodity contracts considers quoted market prices where
    applicable. In cases where actively quoted prices are not
    available, other external sources are used which incorporate
    information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets,
    quoted prices in less active markets and other market
    fundamental analysis.

The following table presents the fair values at December 31 of
    financial instruments and derivatives used in non-trading and
    trading activities:

The carrying amounts of the Corporation’s financial
    instruments and derivatives, including those used in the
    Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, generally
    approximate their fair values at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, except fixed rate long-term debt which had a carrying
    value of $3,124 million and a fair value of
    $3,407 million at December 31, 2007 and a carrying
    value of $3,149 million and a fair value of
    $3,482 million at December 31, 2006.

The Corporation offsets cash collateral received or paid against
    the fair value of its derivative instruments executed with the
    same counterparty. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Corporation is holding cash collateral from counterparties in
    non-trading and trading activities of $393 million and
    $676 million, respectively. The Corporation has posted cash
    collateral to counterparties at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    of $380 million and $112 million, respectively.

Credit Risks:

The Corporation’s
    financial instruments expose it to credit risks and may at times
    be concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
    counterparties. Trade receivables in the Exploration and
    Production and Marketing and Refining businesses are generated
    from a diverse domestic and international customer base. The
    Corporation continuously monitors counterparty concentration and
    credit risk. The Corporation reduces its risk related to certain
    counterparties by using master netting agreements and requiring
    collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.

Guarantees
    and Contingencies

The Corporation’s guarantees include $277 million of
    HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases and $15 million of
    HOVENSA’s senior debt obligations. In addition, the
    Corporation has $61 million in letters of credit for which
    it is contingently liable. As a result, the maximum potential
    amount of future payments that the Corporation could be required
    to make under its guarantees at December 31, 2007 and 2006
    is $353 million. The Corporation also has a contingent
    purchase obligation expiring in April 2010, to acquire the
    remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint
    venture. As of December 31, 2007, the estimated value of
    the purchase obligation is approximately $150 million.

The Corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to
    various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
    environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the
    Corporation’s consolidated financial statements when it is
    probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the
    amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is
    only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however,
    the Corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies in
    accordance with FAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies.

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of substantially identical
    lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental
    entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States
    against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produce
    gasoline containing MTBE, including the Corporation. These cases
    have been consolidated in the Southern District of New York and,
    as of the end of 2007, the Corporation is named as a defendant
    in 51 of approximately 80 cases pending. The principal
    allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing MTBE is a
    defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in
    proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to
    groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action
    to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases
    of MTBE. The damages claimed in these actions are substantial
    and in some cases, punitive damages are also sought. In April
    2005, the District Court denied the primary legal aspects of the
    defendants’ motion to dismiss these actions. As a result of
    Court-ordered mediation, the Corporation anticipates that
    settlement will be reached in a number of the pending cases, the
    number and terms of which are currently being negotiated and are
    subject to a confidentiality agreement. In the fourth quarter
    2007, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of
    $40 million related to MTBE litigation.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve assertions by the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that refining facilities
    were modified or expanded without complying with New Source
    Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required significant
    capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over
    a three to eight year time period. The penalties assessed and
    the capital expenditures required vary considerably between
    refineries. The EPA initially contacted the Corporation and
    HOVENSA regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in August
    2003 and the Corporation and HOVENSA expect to have further
    discussions with EPA regarding the initiative. While it is
    reasonably possible additional capital expenditures and
    operating expenses may be incurred in the future, the amounts
    cannot be estimated at this time. The amount of penalties, if
    any, is not expected to be material to the financial position or
    results of operations of the Corporation.

The Corporation is also currently subject to certain other
    existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings, which it considers
    routine and incidental to its business. The Corporation believes
    that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related
    to any of these other known contingent liability exposures would
    have a material adverse impact on its financial position or
    results of operations.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
    accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
    requirements of the FASB. For reserves to be booked as proved
    they must be commercially producible; government approvals must
    be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost,
    senior management or the board of directors, must commit to fund
    the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve
    estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent
    third party reserve determination as well as internal technical
    appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own
    internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical
    staff that



work directly with the oil and gas properties. The
    Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates
    throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells,
    performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To
    provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve
    estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and
    approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are
    subject to internal technical audits and senior management
    reviews the estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported below are determined
    independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton
    (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. The
    Corporation provided D&M with engineering, geological and
    geophysical data, actual production histories and other
    information necessary for the reserve determination. The
    Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs met to
    review and discuss the information provided. Senior management
    and the Board of Directors reviewed the final reserve estimates
    issued by D&M.

Includes the impact of changes
    in selling prices on production sharing contracts with cost

    barrels of crude oil and 104 million mcf of natural gas,
    relating to higher



Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying year-end oil
    and gas selling prices (adjusted for price changes provided by
    contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of
    proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development
    and production costs, which are based on year-end costs and
    existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are
    computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax
    rates to the pre-tax net cash flows relating to the
    Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash
    flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The
    discounted future net cash flow estimates required by
    FAS No. 69 do not include exploration expenses,
    interest expense or corporate general and administrative
    expenses. The selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are
    highly volatile. The year-end prices, which are required to be
    used for the discounted future net cash flows, do not include
    the effects of hedges and may not be representative of future
    selling prices. The future net cash flow estimates could be
    materially different if other assumptions were used.
