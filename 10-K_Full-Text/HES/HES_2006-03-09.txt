PART I

Items 1 and 2.

Business and Properties

Amerada Hess Corporation (the Registrant) is a Delaware
corporation, incorporated in 1920. The Registrant and its
subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the
“Corporation”) explore for, develop, produce,
purchase, transport and sell crude oil and natural gas. These
exploration and production activities take place in the United
States, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Equatorial
Guinea, Algeria, Gabon, Libya, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan,
Malaysia and other countries. The Corporation also manufactures,
purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum and other energy
products. The Corporation owns 50% of a refinery joint venture
in the United States Virgin Islands, and another refining
facility, terminals and retail gasoline stations located on the
East Coast of the United States.

Exploration and Production

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation had 692 million
barrels of proved crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves
compared with 646 million barrels at the end of 2004.
Proved natural gas reserves were 2,406 million Mcf at
December 31, 2005 compared with 2,400 million Mcf at
December 31, 2004. Proved reserves at December 31,
2005 include 31% and 51%, respectively, of crude oil and natural
gas reserves held under production sharing contracts. Of the
total proved reserves (on a barrel of oil equivalent basis), 16%
are located in the United States, 43% are located in Europe
(consisting of reserves in the North Sea and Russia), 16% are
located in Africa and the remainder are located in Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia, and Azerbaijan. On a barrel of oil
equivalent basis, 42% of the Corporation’s
December 31, 2005 worldwide proved reserves are undeveloped
(38% in 2004).

Worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids production amounted
to 244,000 barrels per day in 2005 compared with
246,000 barrels per day in 2004. Worldwide natural gas
production was 544,000 Mcf per day in 2005 compared with
575,000 Mcf per day in 2004. On a barrel of oil equivalent
basis, production was 335,000 barrels per day in 2005
compared with 342,000 barrels per day in 2004. The impact
of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reduced 2005 full year production
by an average of 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
(boepd).

Worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas
production was as follows:



*

Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of
    relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).

The Corporation presently estimates that its 2006 barrel of
oil equivalent production will be approximately 360,000 to
380,000 barrels per day. The Corporation is developing a
number of oil and gas fields and has an inventory of domestic
and foreign exploration prospects.

United States

During 2005, 23% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
gas liquids production and 25% of its natural gas production
were from United States operations. The Corporation operates
mainly offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Texas,
Louisiana and North Dakota. The Llano field in Garden Banks
Blocks 385 and 386 in the Gulf of Mexico produced at the
rate of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2005.
In 2005, the Corporation acquired an additional 64,000 acres in
the Bakken Shale resource play in the Williston Basin of North
Dakota.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has interests in
approximately 355 exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, of
which it operates 260. The Corporation has 1,391,000 net
undeveloped acres in the Gulf of Mexico.



In 2006, the Corporation intends to drill approximately seven
exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and an
appraisal of the Tubular Bells discovery (AHC 20%) in
Mississippi Canyon Block 725.

The Shenzi development (AHC 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico is expected to be approved in 2006. During the first
quarter of 2006, the Corporation expects to complete the sale of
its interests in certain producing properties in the Permian
Basin in West Texas and New Mexico with a production rate of
approximately 6,000 barrels per day at

year-end

2005.

Europe

During 2005, 47% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
gas liquids production and 50% of its natural gas production
were from European operations.

United Kingdom:

The Corporation’s activities
in the United Kingdom are conducted by its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Amerada Hess Limited. During 2005, 23% of the
Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
and 41% of its natural gas production were from United Kingdom
operations.

Production in 2005 of crude oil and natural gas liquids from the
United Kingdom North Sea was 57,000 barrels per day
compared with 75,000 barrels per day in 2004, principally
from the Corporation’s non-operated interests in the Beryl
(AHC 22.2%), Bittern (AHC 28.3%) and Schiehallion (AHC 15.7%)
fields. In addition, production from the Clair field
(AHC 9.3%) commenced in 2005. Natural gas production from
the United Kingdom in 2005 was 222,000 Mcf of natural gas per
day compared with 268,000 Mcf per day in 2004, primarily
from gas fields in the Easington Catchment Area
(AHC 28.8%), as well as Everest (AHC 18.7%), Lomond
(AHC 16.7%) and Beryl (AHC 22.2%).

Development of the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields is
substantially complete. These fields are expected to commence
production in the second quarter of 2006.

Norway:

The Corporation’s activities in
Norway are conducted through its wholly-owned Norwegian
subsidiary, Amerada Hess Norge

A/ S. Norwegian operations accounted for crude oil and natural
gas liquids production of 27,000 barrels per day in 2005
and 28,000 barrels per day in 2004. Natural gas production
averaged 28,000 Mcf per day in 2005 and 27,000 Mcf per

Corporation’s 77.5% owned Gabonese subsidiary, has
interests in the Rabi Kounga, Toucan and Atora fields. The
Corporation’s share of production averaged
12,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2005 and 2004.

Libya:

In January 2006, the Corporation, in
conjunction with its Oasis Group partners,

re-entered

its former
oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in
Libya. The

re-entry

terms include a

25-year

extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold
an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the
Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In
addition, the Corporation will make a payment of
$106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets
made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006
production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to
25,000 barrels of oil per day.

Egypt:

In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a
55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West
Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the West Med Block) in
Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a 25-year
development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four
existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration
opportunities.

Asia and Other

During 2005, 3% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
gas liquids production and 24% of its natural gas production
were from Asian operations.

Block

A-18

of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand
(JDA):

First production from
Block

A-18

of the
JDA commenced in early 2005. Net production from the
Corporation’s 50% interest averaged 51,000 Mcf of
natural gas and 1,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2005.
Additional gas sales commencing in 2008 were negotiated with
buyers during 2004. Development drilling will continue in 2006
to increase the production capacity of the field in preparation
for the increased gas sales.

Thailand:

The Corporation has a 15% interest in
the Pailin gas field offshore Thailand. Net production from the
Corporation’s interest averaged 57,000 Mcf and
53,000 Mcf of natural gas per day in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The onshore natural gas project in the Phu Horm
Block (AHC 35%) was approved in 2005 and development work is
underway. First production from the Phu Horm field is expected
at the end of 2006.

Indonesia:

Natural gas production in Indonesia
averaged 25,000 Mcf per day in 2005 and 32,000 Mcf per
day in 2004. The Ujung Pangkah gas sales agreement has been
approved and gas sales are expected to commence by early 2007.

Azerbaijan:

The Corporation has a 2.72% interest
in the ACG fields in the Caspian Sea. Net production from its
interest averaged 4,000 barrels of crude oil per day in
2005 and 2,000 barrels per day in 2004. The Corporation
also holds a 2.36% interest in the BTC Pipeline, which is
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2006.

Oil and Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas reserves at the
end of 2005, 2004 and 2003 are presented under Supplementary Oil
and Gas Data in the accompanying financial statements.

During 2005, the Corporation provided oil and gas reserve
estimates for 2004 to the Department of Energy. Such estimates
are compatible with the information furnished to the SEC on
Form

10-K,

although not necessarily directly comparable due to the
requirements of the individual requests. There were no
differences in excess of 5%.



The Corporation has no contracts or agreements to sell fixed
quantities of its crude oil production, although derivative
instruments are used to reduce the effects of changes in selling
prices. In the United States, natural gas is sold to local
distribution companies, and commercial, industrial and other
purchasers, on a spot basis and under contracts for varying
periods. The Corporation’s United States production is
expected to approximate 50% of its 2006 sales commitments under
long-term contracts. Long-term natural gas sales commitments for
2007 are expected to be comparable. The Corporation attempts to
minimize price and supply risks associated with its United
States natural gas supply commitments by entering into purchase
contracts with third parties having adequate sources of supply,
on terms substantially similar to those under its commitments.

Refining:

The Corporation owns a 50% interest in
HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a refining joint venture in the United
States Virgin Islands with a subsidiary of Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In addition, it owns and operates a
refining facility in Port Reading, New Jersey.

HOVENSA:

HOVENSA’s total crude runs amounted
to 461,000 barrels per day in 2005 and 484,000 barrels
per day in 2004. The fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA
operated at the rates of 123,000 and 139,000 barrels per
day in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA
operated at the rate of 54,000 barrels per day in 2005 and
55,000 barrels per day in 2004. The following table

The coker permits HOVENSA to run lower-cost heavy crude oil.
HOVENSA has a long-term supply contract with PDVSA to purchase
115,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy crude
oil. PDVSA also supplies 155,000 barrels per day of
Venezuelan Mesa medium gravity crude oil to HOVENSA under a
long-term crude oil supply contract. The remaining crude oil
requirements are purchased mainly under contracts of one year or
less from third parties and through spot purchases on the open
market. After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to unrelated
third parties, the Corporation purchases 50% of
HOVENSA’s remaining production at market prices.

Port Reading Facility:

The Corporation owns and
operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading,
New Jersey, with a capacity of 65,000 barrels per day. This
facility processes residual fuel oil and vacuum gas oil and
operated at a rate of approximately 55,000 barrels per day
in 2005 and 52,000 barrels per day in 2004. Substantially
all of Port Reading’s production is gasoline and heating
oil. In 2005, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for
36 days of planned maintenance.

Marketing:

The Corporation markets refined
petroleum products on the East Coast of the United States to the
motoring public, wholesale distributors, industrial and
commercial users, other petroleum companies, governmental
agencies and public utilities. It also markets natural gas to
utilities and other industrial and commercial customers. The
Corporation’s energy marketing activities also include the
sale of



electricity. In 2005, the Corporation acquired two natural gas
marketing businesses, First Energy Solutions and EnLine
Solutions.

The Corporation has 1,354
HESS

®

gasoline stations at December 31, 2005, including stations
owned by the WilcoHess joint venture, of which approximately 86%
are company or WilcoHess operated. Of the operated stations, 92%
have convenience stores on the sites. Most of the
Corporation’s gasoline stations are in New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts and North and South
Carolina. In June 2005, the WilcoHess joint venture acquired
approximately 100 retail sites in North Carolina through the
acquisition of Trade Oil Company.

Refined product sales averaged 456,000 barrels per day in
2005 and 428,000 barrels per day in 2004. Of total refined
products sold in 2005, approximately 50% was obtained from
HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation purchased the balance
from others under short-term supply contracts and by spot
purchases from various sources.

The Corporation has 22 terminals with an aggregate storage
capacity of 22 million barrels in its East Coast marketing
areas.

The Corporation also has a 50% interest in a joint venture, Hess
LNG, which is pursuing investments in liquefied natural gas
(LNG) terminals and related supply, trading and marketing
opportunities. The joint venture is pursuing development of an
LNG terminal project located in Fall River, Massachusetts.

The Corporation has a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides
distributed electricity generating equipment to industrial and
commercial customers as an alternative to purchasing electricity
from local utilities. The Corporation also has invested in
long-term technology to develop fuel cells for electricity
generation through a venture with other parties.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account.

Competition and Market Conditions

See Item 1A, Risk Factors Related to Our Business and
Operations, for a discussion of competition and market
conditions.

Other Items

Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution
control regulations imposed by federal, state and local
governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Corporation’s earnings and competitive position within
the industry. The Corporation spent $15 million in 2005 for
environmental remediation, with a comparable amount anticipated
for 2006. Regulatory changes already made or anticipated in the
United States will alter the composition and emissions
characteristics of motor fuels. The Environmental Protection
Agency has adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in
gasoline and diesel fuel. Capital expenditures necessary to
comply with the low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading
are estimated to be approximately $75 million. Of this
amount, approximately $23 million was spent in 2005 and the
remainder is principally expected to be spent in 2006. Capital
expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel
requirements at HOVENSA are expected to be approximately
$410 million, $160 million of which has already been
spent. Approximately $200 million is expected to be spent
in 2006. HOVENSA expects to finance these capital expenditures
through cash flow from operations.

The number of persons employed by the Corporation averaged
11,610 in 2005 and 11,119 in 2004.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
subject to significant risk factors, including those described
below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect
our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of
operations, and holders and purchasers of our securities could
lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating
to our securities may be included in the prospectus supplements
for securities we issue in the future.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Price
Risk:

Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash
flows and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of
crude oil and natural gas, which are influenced by numerous
factors beyond our control. Historically these prices have been
very volatile. The major foreign oil producing countries,
including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), exert considerable influence over the supply
and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their
ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of
production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil
markets. The derivatives markets are also important in
influencing the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and
refined petroleum products. A significant downward trend in
commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our
revenues, profitability and cash flow and could result in a
reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets,
goodwill and proved oil and gas reserves. To the extent that we
engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price
volatility, we will not realize the benefit of price increases
above the hedged price.

Technical Risk:

We own or
have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which
will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas reserves
is subject to successful exploration drilling, development
activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future
oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in
finding and developing additional quantities of proved reserves.
Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and
other geological and geophysical data, which does not always
successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of
hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include adverse unexpected
conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment
failure, blow-outs and weather interruptions. Future
developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions
which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The
costs of drilling and development activities have also been
increasing, which could negatively affect expected economic
returns. Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired
oil and gas properties, similar uncertainties may be encountered
in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from
others.

Oil and Gas Reserves and
Discounted Future Net Cash Flow Risks:

Numerous
uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves
and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future
production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital
expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and
quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary
substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could
materially affect the estimated quantities and future net
revenues of our proved reserves. In addition, reserve estimates
may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on
production performance, purchases or sales of properties,
results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices and
other factors.

Political Risk:

Federal,
state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations
relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims,
expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, and
changes in import regulations, as well as other political
developments may affect our operations. We have been affected by
certain of these events in several countries in which we
operate. Some of the international areas in which we operate may
be politically less stable than our domestic operations. We
market motor fuels through lessee-dealers and wholesalers in
certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners
of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor
fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in the
U.S. Congress and in various other states.



Environmental Risk:

and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to
environmental hazards such as oil spills, produced water spills,
gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases
that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or
other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to
numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these
laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or
criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource
damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly
stringent environmental regulations, particularly relating to
the production of motor and other fuels, has resulted, and will
likely continue to result, in higher capital expenditures and
operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry generally.

Competitive Risk:

The
petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital
intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in
each of our activities, particularly in acquiring rights to
explore for crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and
marketing of refined products and natural gas. Many competitors,
including national oil companies, are larger and have
substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with
producers and marketers of other forms of energy. Increased
competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly
increased the cost of acquisitions. In addition, competition for
drilling services and equipment has affected the availability of
drilling rigs and increased capital and operating costs.

Catastrophic Risk:

Although
we maintain an appropriate level of insurance coverage against
property and casualty losses, our oil and gas operations are
subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy
assets or interrupt operations. Examples of catastrophic risks
include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts. These
occurrences have affected us from time to time. During 2005, our
annual Gulf of Mexico production of crude oil and natural gas
was reduced by 7,000 boepd due to the impact of Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

As disclosed in Registrant’s
Form

10-K

for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 (the
Form

10-K),

purported class actions consolidated under a complaint
captioned:

In re Amerada Hess Securities

Litigation were
pending in United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey against Registrant and certain executive officers and
former executive officers of the Registrant alleging that these
individuals sold shares of the Registrant’s common stock in
advance of the Registrant’s acquisition of Triton Energy
Limited (Triton) in 2001 in violation of federal securities
laws. In April 2003, the Registrant and the other defendants
filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and
failure to plead fraud with particularity. On March 31,
2004, the court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss
the complaint. The plaintiffs were granted leave to file an
amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in June
2004. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In June
2005, this motion was denied. Defendants believe this action is
without merit and will continue to defend this action vigorously.

The Registrant, along with many other companies engaged in
refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
and claims related to the use of the methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE) in gasoline. A series of substantially identical
lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental
entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States
against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produce
gasoline containing MTBE, including Registrant. These cases have
been consolidated in the Southern District of New York and
Registrant is named as a defendant in 40 of the 70 cases
pending. The principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline
containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties
are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline
market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to
take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the
environment of releases of MTBE. In some cases, punitive damages
are also sought. In April 2005, the District Court denied the
primary legal aspects of the defendants’ motion to dismiss
these actions. While the damages claimed in these actions are
substantial, only limited information is available to evaluate
the factual and legal merits of those claims. The Corporation
also believes that significant legal uncertainty remains
regarding the validity of causes of action asserted and
availability of the relief sought by plaintiffs. Accordingly,
based on the information currently available, there is
insufficient information on which to evaluate the
Corporation’s exposure in these cases.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
consent agreements to resolve EPA’s assertions that
refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying
with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new
emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations
that impose emissions control requirements. These consent
agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative
focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically
imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required
(i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
(ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
operating costs. EPA initially contacted Registrant and HOVENSA
L.L.C. (HOVENSA), its 50% owned joint venture with Petroleos de
Venezuela, regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in August
2003 and discussions resumed in August, 2005. Registrant and
HOVENSA expect to have further discussions with EPA regarding
the petroleum refining initiative, although both Registrant and
HOVENSA have already installed many of the pollution controls
required of other refiners under the consent agreements and EPA
has not made any specific assertions that either Registrant or
HOVENSA violated either New Source Review or other regulations
which would require additional controls. While the effect on the
Corporation of the petroleum refinery initiative cannot be
estimated at this time, additional future capital expenditures
and operating expenses may be incurred. The amount of penalties,
if any, is not expected to be material to the Corporation.

Registrant is one of over 60 companies that have received a
directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the
sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking
natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects
Registrant, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk
storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by Registrant.
EPA has also issued an Administrative Order on Consent relating
to the same contamination. While NJDEP has suggested a remedial
cost of over $900 million, the costs of remediation of the
Passaic River sediments are the subject of a remedial
investigation and feasibility study currently being conducted on
a portion of the river by EPA under an agreement with Registrant
and over 40 other companies. Thus, remedial costs cannot be



reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts
and circumstances, Registrant does not believe that this matter
will result in material liability because its terminal could not
have contributed contamination along most of the river’s
length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the
greatest concern in the river sediments, and because there are
numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of
remediation and damages.

On or about July 15, 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp.
(HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant, and HOVENSA
L.L.C., in which Registrant owns a 50% interest, each received a
letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of
Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees,
advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit against
HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous
substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south
shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had been
operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed on
May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands
against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated
industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix asserting
that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and territorial
statutory and common law for damages to natural resources. HOVIC
and HOVENSA do not believe that this matter will result in a
material liability as they believe that they have strong
defenses to this complaint, and they intend to vigorously defend
this matter.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notified the
Registrant that on July 21, 2005, it commenced a private
investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial
Guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of
the government of Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC has
requested documents and information from the Registrant and
other oil and gas companies that have operations or interests in
Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC had previously been
conducting an informal inquiry into such matters. The Registrant
has been cooperating and continues to cooperate with the SEC
investigation.

Registrant has been served with a complaint from the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation
(DEC) relating to alleged violations at its petroleum
terminal in Brooklyn, New York. The complaint, which seeks an
order to shut down the terminal and penalties in unspecified
amounts, alleges violations involving the structural integrity
of certain tanks, the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads,
petroleum discharges and improper certification of tank repairs.
DEC is also seeking relief relating to remediation of certain
gasoline stations in the New York metropolitan area. Registrant
believes that many of the allegations are factually inaccurate
or based on an incorrect interpretation of applicable law.
Registrant has already addressed the primary conditions
discussed in the complaint. Registrant intends to vigorously
contest the complaint, but is involved in settlement discussions
with DEC.

In June 2001, the Corporation voluntarily investigated and
disclosed to the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (NJDEP) that there was a calculation error
in the program code of the Port Reading refining facility’s
Wet Gas Scrubber (WGS) Continuous Emissions Monitoring
System (CEM). The error in the code resulted in the CEM system
under-calculating carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide (NOx) and
sulfur dioxide emissions from the WGS beginning in late 1998 and
some exceedances of the permit limits for NOx. After discovery,
the code error was promptly corrected. In November 2003, the
Corporation received a notice of violation from the NJDEP
relating to the CEM coding error. This matter was resolved by
payment of $114,000 in December 2005.

In April 2003, HOVENSA received a notice of violation from the
Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources
(DPNR), relating to certain alleged wastewater permit
exceedances occurring in 2001 and 2002 at HOVENSA. This matter
was resolved by execution of Consent Order in December 2004,
which required payment of penalty of $120,000 in January 2005.

The Registrant periodically receives notices from EPA that it is
a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
claims or assertions of liability



against the Corporation relating to these sites have not been
fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s
claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under
consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material.
The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related
proceedings by private parties, on the business or accounts of
the Corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the
large number of other potentially responsible parties and the
speculative nature of

clean-up

cost
estimates, but is not expected to be material.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of
them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such
proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In management’s
opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances,
such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

A five-year summary of selected financial data follows:



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
operates in two segments, exploration and production (E&P)
and marketing and refining. The E&P segment explores for,
develops, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The
marketing and refining segment manufactures, purchases, trades
and markets refined petroleum products and other energy products.

Exploration & Production

The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to
grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially
disciplined manner. The Corporation has increased its reserve
life in each of the last three years. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, the Corporation’s total proved reserves were
1,093 million and 1,046 million barrels of oil
equivalent. The following table summarizes the components of
proved reserves as of December 31:

Income from continuing operations was $1,058 million in
2005, $755 million in 2004 and $414 million in 2003.
The improved results were primarily driven by increasingly
higher oil and gas prices during the reporting period. See
further discussion in Comparison of Results on page 21.

Production totaled 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day (boepd) in 2005, 342,000 boepd in 2004 and 373,000
boepd in 2003. During 2005, first production was achieved from
Block

A-18

of the
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), the Clair field
in the North Sea and Phase 1 of the ACG fields in
Azerbaijan. Damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the
Gulf of Mexico caused production to be lower by 7,000 boepd in
2005. The Corporation estimates that production will be
approximately 360,000 boepd to 380,000 boepd in 2006.

The Corporation has a number of development projects that are in
various stages of completion that should begin production in
2006 and 2007. Development milestones achieved in 2005 include:

During 2005, the Corporation acquired a controlling interest in
a corporate joint venture operating in the Volga-Urals region of
Russia. Subsequent to the acquisition, this venture acquired
additional licenses and



assets, bringing the Corporation’s total investment in
Russia to approximately $400 million. Production averaged
6,000 boepd in 2005 and is expected to average 12,000 to
15,000 boepd in 2006.

In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis
Group partners, re-entered its former oil and gas production
operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. The re-entry terms
include a

25-year

extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold
an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the
Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In
addition, the Corporation will make a payment of
$106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets
made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006
production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to
25,000 boepd.

In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a 55% working interest
in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1
Concession (the West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million.
The Corporation has a 25-year development lease for the West Med
Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and
additional exploration opportunities.

In 2006, the Corporation will complete the sale of its interests
in certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in
West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million, before purchase
price adjustments. The Corporation estimates that it will record
an after-tax gain of $160 to $180 million in the first
quarter on the sale of these assets.

Marketing & Refining

The Corporation’s strategy is to deliver consistent
financial performance from marketing and refining assets and
generate free cash flow. Net income was $515 million in
2005, $451 million in 2004 and $327 million in 2003.
Refining operations contributed net income of $346 million
in 2005, $302 million in 2004 and $165 million in
2003. Marketing earnings were $136 million in 2005,
$112 million in 2004 and $145 million in 2003. Total
marketing and refining earnings improved due to increased
margins and higher refined product sales volumes. The
Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA totaling
$275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004.

In 2005, the Corporation’s Port Reading facility commenced
its approximately $75 million program for complying with
low-sulfur gasoline requirements. Capital expenditures of
$23 million were made in 2005 with the remainder of the
expenditures anticipated in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply
with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA
are expected to approximate $410 million, of which
$160 million has been spent. Anticipated capital
expenditures in 2006 for the low-sulfur requirements are
$200 million. HOVENSA plans to finance these capital
expenditures through cash flow from operations.

Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$1,840 million in 2005 compared with $1,903 million in
2004. At December 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents
totaled $315 million compared with $877 million at
December 31, 2004. The Corporation’s debt to
capitalization ratio at December 31, 2005 was 37.6%
compared with 40.7% at the end of 2004. Total debt was
$3,785 million at December 31, 2005 and
$3,835 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporation
has debt maturities of $26 million in 2006.



Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the
years ended December 31:

The Corporation has approved a $4 billion capital and
exploratory expenditure program for 2006, which includes a total
of approximately $780 million for the acquisition of
Egyptian assets and re-entry to the Waha concessions in Libya.
Excluding acquisitions, $3.1 billion is targeted for
Exploration and Production and $125 million for Marketing
and Refining.

Consolidated Results of Operations

Net income from continuing operations in 2005 was
$1,242 million compared with $970 million in 2004 and
$467 million in 2003. See the following page for a table of
items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods.

The after-tax results by major operating activity are summarized
below:

In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to
pre-tax amounts.



The following items of income (expense), on an after-tax basis,
are included in income from continuing operations:

The items in the table above are explained, and the pre-tax
amounts are shown, on pages 24 through 26.

Comparison of Results

Exploration and Production

Following is a summarized income statement of the
Corporation’s exploration and production operations:



After considering the exploration and production items in the
table on page 24, the remaining changes in exploration and
production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in
selling prices, production volumes and operating costs and
exploration expenses, as discussed below.

Selling prices:

Higher average selling prices of
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas increased
exploration and production revenues from continuing operations
by approximately $870 million, including the effect of
hedging, in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2004, the change in
average selling prices increased revenues by approximately
$400 million compared with 2003.

The Corporation’s average selling prices, including the
effects of hedging, were as follows:

The Corporation’s average selling prices, excluding the
effects of hedging, were as follows:

The after-tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by
$989 million ($1,582 million before income taxes) in
2005, $583 million ($935 million before income taxes)
in 2004 and $260 million ($418 million before income
taxes) in 2003.

Production and sales volumes:

The
Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was
335,000 boepd in 2005, 342,000 boepd in 2004 and 373,000 boepd
in 2003. Hurricane related interruptions in the Gulf of Mexico
reduced 2005 production by approximately 7,000 boepd. The
Corporation anticipates that



its 2006 production will average between 360,000 and 380,000
boepd, including 20,000 to 25,000 boepd from Libya. The
Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows:

*

Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of
    relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).

Crude oil production in the United States in 2005 included
increased production from the Llano field which offset natural
decline and the effect of the hurricanes. Production in Europe
was lower due to natural decline and increased maintenance,
partially offset by new production from Russia. Increased crude
oil production in Africa is principally due to improved
performance from the Ceiba field in Equatorial Guinea. Natural
gas production in Asia increased due to new production from the
JDA.

Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of
approximately $80 million in 2005 and $75 million in
2004.

Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and
amortization:

Cash operating costs, consisting of
production expenses and general and administrative expenses,
increased by $147 million in 2005 and $44 million in
2004 compared with the prior years, excluding the hurricane
related costs and accrued severance and office lease costs
discussed on page 24. Production expenses increased in 2005
and 2004, principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses,
production taxes and fuel costs. Production expenses in 2005
also increased due to expanded operations in Russia and the JDA.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in
2005, principally due to higher per barrel rates. Depreciation
and related charges were lower in 2004 compared with 2003,
reflecting decreased production volumes. Unit production costs
per barrel of oil equivalent, comprised of production expense,
administrative costs and depreciation, depletion and
amortization totaled $16.88 in 2005, $14.96 in 2004 and $14.52
in 2003. Unit production costs in 2006 are estimated to be $17
to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent.

Exploration expenses:

Exploration expenses were
higher in 2005, reflecting increased drilling and seismic
activity compared with 2004. Exploration expenses were lower in
2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower dry hole costs.



Other:

After-tax foreign currency gains were
$20 million ($3 million loss before income taxes) in
2005 and $6 million ($29 million before income taxes)
in 2004, compared with a loss of $22 million
($4 million before income taxes) in 2003.

The effective income tax rate for exploration and production
operations was 41% in 2005, 43% in 2004 and 47% in 2003. After
considering the items in the table below, the effective income
tax rates were 42% in 2005, 46% in 2004 and 51% in 2003. The
effective income tax rate for exploration and production
operations in 2006 is expected to be in the range of 50% to 52%.
The increase in the estimated 2006 effective income tax rate is
due to an anticipated additional 10% supplementary tax on oil
and gas earnings in the United Kingdom, and the estimated impact
of Libyan operations, which commenced in 2006 and will be taxed
at a rate higher than the current exploration and production
effective rate. In addition, there will also be a one-time
non-cash charge of approximately $40 to $50 million from
the adjustment of deferred income tax liabilities when the
anticipated United Kingdom tax is enacted, which is expected to
be in the second or third quarter of 2006.

Reported exploration and production earnings include the

taxes:

2005:

The gains from asset sales in 2005 represent the
disposal of non-producing properties in the United Kingdom and
the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased
interest in the Pangkah natural gas development in Indonesia.
The Corporation incurred incremental expenses, principally
repair costs and higher insurance premiums in 2005, as a result
of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are included in
production expenses in the income statement. The income tax
adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a
reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement
in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the
favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset
sale, which is reflected in non-operating income in the income
statement.

2004:

The Corporation recognized gains on the sales of an
office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non-producing property
in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also
recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in
tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation accrued an
additional amount for severance and vacated office space during
2004, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses
in the income statement.

2003:

The Corporation recorded an after-tax charge for
accrued severance in the United States and United Kingdom and a
reduction of leased office space in London. The pre-tax amount
of this charge was $53 million, of which $32 million
relates to vacated office space. The remainder of
$21 million relates to severance for positions that were
eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. These expenses are
reflected principally in general and administrative expenses in
the income statement.

The Corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the
recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain
prior year foreign exploration expenses. The gain from asset
sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the Corporation’s 1.5%
interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System.

The Corporation’s future exploration and production
earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political
risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural
gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation,
exploration expenses and changes in tax rates.



Marketing and Refining

Earnings from marketing and refining activities amounted to
$515 million in 2005, $451 million in 2004 and
$327 million in 2003. After considering the marketing and
refining items in the table on page 26, the earnings
amounted to $491 million in 2005, $439 million in 2004
and $347 million in 2003 and are discussed in the
paragraphs below. The Corporation’s downstream operations
include HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a
subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is
accounted for using the equity method. Additional marketing and
refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility
in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline
stations, energy marketing and trading operations.

Refining:

Refining earnings, which consist of the
Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results, Port Reading
earnings, interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA and
other miscellaneous items were $346 million in 2005,
$302 million in 2004 and $165 million in 2003.

The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was
$376 million ($231 million after income taxes) in 2005
and $244 million ($216 million after income taxes) in
2004. In 2003, HOVENSA’s earnings were $117 million,
before and after income taxes. The increased earnings in 2005
were due to higher refining margins. In 2005, the Corporation
provided income taxes at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of
38.5% on HOVENSA’s income and the interest income on the
PDVSA note. In 2004, income taxes on HOVENSA’s earnings
were partially offset by available loss carryforwards. Cash
distributions from HOVENSA were $275 million in 2005 and
$88 million in 2004. A crude unit and the fluid catalytic
cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for approximately
30 days of scheduled maintenance in 2005.

Pre-tax interest on the PDVSA note was $20 million,
$25 million and $30 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Interest income is reflected in non-operating
income in the income statement. At December 31, 2005, the
remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $212 million, which
is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009.

Port Reading’s after-tax earnings were $100 million in
2005, $60 million in 2004 and $27 million in 2003,
reflecting higher margins in each period. In 2005, the Port
Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned
maintenance.

Marketing:

Marketing operations, which consist
principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities,
generated income of $112 million in 2005, $100 million
in 2004 and $165 million in 2003, excluding the income from
liquidation of LIFO inventories and other items described on
page 26. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher
margins and increased sales volumes. The decrease in 2004 was
principally due to lower margins. Total refined product sales
volumes were 456,000 barrels per day in 2005,
428,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 419,000 barrels
per day in 2003.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the
trading partnership amounted



to income of $33 million in 2005, $37 million in 2004
and $17 million in 2003. Before income taxes, the trading
income amounted to $60 million in 2005, $72 million in
2004 and $30 million in 2003, which is included in
operating revenues in the income statement.

Marketing expenses increased in 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflecting
additional retail sites and higher costs of the trading
partnership.

Reported marketing and refining earnings include the following
items of income (expense) before and after income taxes:

In 2005, marketing and refining earnings include income from the
liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories and a charge
resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility
industry, which is included in marketing expenses. In 2004,
marketing and refining results include income from the
liquidation of LIFO inventories. In 2003, marketing and refining
earnings were reduced by a loss from the sale of the
Corporation’s interest in a shipping joint venture.

Marketing and refining earnings will likely continue to be
volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions, government
regulatory changes and supply and demand factors, including the
effects of weather.

Corporate

The following table summarizes corporate expenses:

The American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one-time reduction
in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible
dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent.
During 2005, the Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of
previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the
recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The
pre-tax amounts of the bond repurchase premiums in 2005 and 2003
were $39 million and $58 million, respectively, which
are reflected in non-operating income in the income statement.
The pre-tax amount of the 2004 corporate insurance accrual was
$20 million. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses in 2006
are estimated to be in the range of $105 to $115 million.

interest.

Discontinued Operations

In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing
properties in Colombia plus $10 million in cash, for an
additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in the JDA. In
addition, the Corporation sold, for aggregate proceeds of
$445 million, producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico
shelf, the Jabung field in Indonesia and several small United
Kingdom fields. These disposals resulted in a net gain from
asset sales of $116 million and income from operations
prior to sale was $53 million, after income taxes. Income
from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004 reflects
the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to
the exchanged Colombian assets.

Change in Accounting Principle

The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (FAS) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, effective January 1, 2003. A
net after-tax gain of $7 million resulting from the
cumulative effect of this accounting change was recorded at the
beginning of 2003.

Sales and Other Operating Revenues

Sales and other operating revenues totaled $22,747 million
in 2005, an increase of 36% compared with 2004. The increase
reflects higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas in
exploration and production activities and higher selling prices
and sales volumes in marketing activities. In 2004, sales and
other operating revenues totaled $16,733 million, an
increase of 17% compared with 2003. This increase principally
reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined
products, partially offset by decreased sales of purchased
natural gas in marketing activities. The change in cost of goods
sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and
prices of refined products and purchased natural gas.

Operating Activities:

In 2005, net cash provided
by operating activities of $1,840 million was comparable to
the prior year as higher earnings in 2005 were offset by a
decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities,
principally working capital, of $408 million. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $1,903 million in
2004, an increase of $322 million over 2003, resulting
primarily from higher earnings and an increase from changes in
operating assets and liabilities of $227 million. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $1,581 million in
2003. The Corporation received cash distributions of
$275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004 from
HOVENSA.

Investing Activities:

The following table
summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures:



Proceeds from asset sales in 2005 and 2004 were $74 million
and $57 million, respectively, principally from the sale of
non-producing properties. Proceeds from asset sales totaled
$545 million in 2003.

Financing Activities:

The Corporation reduced debt
by $50 million in 2005, $106 million in 2004 and
$1,051 million in 2003. In 2005, bond repurchases of
$600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving
credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign
earnings to the United States. The net reduction in debt in 2005
and 2004 was funded by available cash and cash flow from
operations. In 2003, debt was reduced by proceeds of
$653 million from the issuance of 13,500,000 shares of
mandatory convertible preferred stock and from asset sales, as
well as cash flow from operations. In 2005 and 2004, the
Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options
totaling $62 million and $90 million, respectively.
Dividends paid were $159 million in 2005, $157 million
in 2004 and $108 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was
due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock issued in the fourth
quarter of 2003.

Future Capital Requirements and Resources:

In
January 2006, the Corporation announced a $4 billion
capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2006, which
includes approximately $780 million for the acquisition of
Egyptian assets and payments for the Corporation’s re-entry
into Libya. Excluding acquisitions, $3.1 billion relates to
exploration and production, including $1,370 million for
development, $1,130 million for production and
$570 million for exploration. The program also includes
$125 million for marketing and refining.

The Corporation’s aggregate maturities of long-term debt
total $54 million over the next two years. The Corporation
anticipates it will fund its 2006 operations, including capital
expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt
repayments, with existing cash on-hand and cash flow from
operations and, as necessary, additional borrowings on the
revolving credit facility.

Outstanding letters of credit, principally relating to hedging
activities at December 31, were as follows:

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has
$1,872 million available under its $2.5 billion
syndicated revolving credit facility and has additional unused
lines of credit of approximately $370 million, primarily
for letters of credit, under uncommitted arrangements with
banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which
it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock
or preferred stock.

A loan agreement covenant allows the Corporation to borrow up to
an additional $6.7 billion for the construction or
acquisition of assets at December 31, 2005. At year end,
the maximum amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be
paid from borrowings under this covenant is $2.5 billion.

Credit Ratings:

Two credit rating agencies have
rated the Corporation’s debt as investment grade and one
rating agency’s rating is below investment grade. If
another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below
investment grade, the Corporation would have to comply with a
more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving
credit facility. In addition, margin requirements with
non-trading and trading counterparties at December 31, 2005
would increase by approximately $30 million.

The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined
    product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount
    to approximately $4.6 billion annually using year-end 2005
    prices.

In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future
supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market
prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA,
and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included
are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional
gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail
marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to
purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers
in its energy marketing business. These commitments were
computed based on year-end market prices.

The table also reflects that portion of the Corporation’s
planned $4 billion capital expenditure program that is
contractually committed at December 31. Obligations for
operating expenses include commitments for transportation,
seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other
normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect
contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at
December 31, including minimum pension plan funding
requirements.

At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had an accrual of
$39 million for vacated office costs in London. During
2005, $8 million of payments were made reducing the accrual
to $31 million at December 31, 2005. Additional
accruals totaling approximately $30 million, before income
taxes, are anticipated in 2006 for office space to be vacated.

In December 2005, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) issued
an order to the Corporation to pay royalties on certain deep
water exploration leases in the Gulf of Mexico held by the
Corporation. In the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (the
Act), Congress granted royalty relief in order to encourage deep
water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. With respect to
exploration leases issued between November 28, 1995 and
November 28, 2000, the Act granted royalty relief without
regard to the market price of crude oil and natural gas at the
time the royalty is payable. However, in regulations promulgated
by MMS relating to these deep water leases, the MMS imposed a
price threshold such that if the market price for crude oil or
natural gas exceeded the threshold, royalty relief would not be
granted. The Corporation has accrued $34 million for
royalties relating to sales from these leases, which the
Corporation believes is its full potential liability if the MMS
regulations are determined to be valid.

The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring
in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in a retail
marketing and gasoline station joint venture for approximately
$140 million.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates
based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices
and at December 31, 2005 amounted to $135 million. In
addition, the



Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of
$40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to
meet its senior debt obligations.

At December 31, the Corporation has $2,612 million of
letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities
with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance
sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under
letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other
entities directly related to its business, as follows:

    pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

The Corporation
has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet,
primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is
$480 million at December 31, 2005 compared with
$467 million at December 31, 2004. The
Corporation’s December 31, 2005 debt to capitalization
ratio would increase from 37.6% to 40.4% if these leases were
included as debt.

Contingencies”

above, note 5, “Refining Joint
Venture,” and note 16, “Guarantees and
Contingencies,” in the financial statements.

Foreign Operations:

The Corporation conducts
exploration and production activities in the United Kingdom,
Norway, Denmark, Russia, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Azerbaijan,
Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Libya and other countries.
Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated
with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk
(including tax law changes) and currency risk.

HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by
Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a
refinery in the Virgin Islands. In the past, there have been
political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the availability
of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations, however,
these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the
Corporation’s financial position. The Corporation has a
note receivable of $212 million at December 31, 2005
from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments are current and the
Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance.

Subsequent Events

In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis
Group partners, re-entered its former oil and gas production
operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. The re-entry terms
include a

25-year

extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold
an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the
Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In
addition, the Corporation will make a payment of
$106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets
made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006
production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to
25,000 boepd.

In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a 55% working interest
in the deepwater section of the West Med Block in Egypt for
$413 million. The Corporation has a 25-year development
lease for the West Med Block, which contains four existing
natural gas discoveries and additional exploration opportunities.

In 2006, the Corporation will complete the sale of its interests
in certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in
West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million, before purchase
price adjustments. The net book value of these assets held for
sale of approximately $70 million has been recorded in
other current assets at December 31, 2005. The Corporation
estimates that it will record an after-tax gain of
$160 million to $180 million in the first quarter on
the sale of these assets.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
accounting methods used can affect net income,
stockholders’ equity and various financial statement
ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies
generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs:

Exploration and production activities are accounted for using
the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and
proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses,
brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized.
Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry
hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and
equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and
related production facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if
there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational
viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged
to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing
reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project
include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations
for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with
governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for
additional drilling and other factors.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:

The
determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant
element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration
and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves
affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation
rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as
impairment testing of oil and gas assets.

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
producible, government and project operator approvals must be
obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior
management or the board of directors, must commit to fund the
project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation
and reporting process involves an annual independent third party
reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals
of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the
estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary
Oil and Gas Data in accordance with FAS No. 69 are
determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and
MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal
estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with
engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production
histories and other information necessary for the reserve
determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s
technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information
provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review
the final reserve estimates issued by D&M.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:

As
explained below there are significant differences in the way
long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for
impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets,
including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may
not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on
identifiable cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets)
and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets
and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived
assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future
net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an
impairment loss is recorded. The



amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the
assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash
flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted
at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected
production volumes represent reserves, including probable
reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount
of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and
timing of production are consistent with internal projections
and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices
used for determining asset impairments will generally differ
from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use
of actual prices on the last day of the year.

The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived
exploration and production producing assets are based on its
best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery
factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the
timing of future production, which are updated each time an
impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have
impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas
fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil
and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset
impairments.

In accordance with FAS No. 142, the Corporation’s
goodwill is not amortized, but must be tested for impairment
annually at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units
used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are
determined primarily from the manner in which the business is
managed. The Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the
exploration and production operating segment and it expects that
the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation
of that segment.

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration
and production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted
anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known
developments, (2) the estimated risked present value of
exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to
reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential
synergies including cost savings, access to new business
opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and
increased market share. The Corporation also considers the
relative market valuation of similar exploration and production
companies.

The determination of the fair value of the exploration and
production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and
gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and
market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and
natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a
decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production
operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived
assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the
exploration and production segment.

Segments:

The Corporation has two operating
segments, exploration and production and marketing and refining.
Management has determined that these are its operating segments
because, in accordance with FAS No. 131, these are the
segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in business
activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly
reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision
maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segment and assess its performance and
(iii) for which discrete financial information is
available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation, is the CODM as defined in
FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing
the functions within the Corporation of allocating resources to,
and assessing the performance of, the Corporation’s
operating segments.

Hedging:

The Corporation may use futures,
forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to
reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and
refined product prices. Related hedge gains or losses are an
integral part of the selling or purchase prices. Generally,
these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future
cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) and the
changes in fair



value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
These transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting,
including correlation. The Corporation’s hedges are tested
prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively
and retrospectively on an on-going basis to ensure they continue
to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and
retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using a
historical simulation model. The simulation utilizes historical
observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot
prices.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has
$1,304 million of deferred hedging losses, after income
taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The
Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in
accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time
the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective portion
of hedges is included in current earnings. The
Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign
currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change
in fair value is included in income currently.

Income Taxes:

Judgments are required in the
determination and recognition of income tax assets and
liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net
operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including
the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for
those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax
assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and
tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments
are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being
realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that
is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of
deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal
periods for temporary differences, available carryforward
periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable
income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the
existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of
future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas
reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the
Corporation’s internal business forecasts.

New Accounting Standard:

In 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board reissued Statement No. 123,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123R). This standard
requires that compensation expense for all stock-based payments
to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be
recognized in the income statement based on fair values. The
Corporation adopted FAS 123R as of January 1, 2006.
The actual cost of expensing stock options in 2006 and future
periods will be based on a number of factors, including the
amount of options granted, the terms of such awards and the
stock price at the time of grant. The Corporation estimates that
the cost of unvested options at December 31, 2005 and the
annual grant of employee stock options in February 2006, will
increase compensation expense in 2006 by approximately
$30 million, before income taxes. Awards of restricted
common stock are expensed over the vesting period under existing
accounting requirements and will continue to be expensed under
FAS 123R.

Environment, Health and Safety

The Corporation has implemented a values-based,
socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment,
health and safety performance and making a positive impact on
communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s
environment, health, safety and social responsibility
(EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety
management systems that help protect the Corporation’s
workforce, customers and local communities. The
Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or
exceed international standards and are intended to promote
internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and
continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved
performance may, in the short-term, increase the
Corporation’s operating costs and could also require
increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to
assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to
enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity
and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral
benefits from investments in EHS & SR. While overall
governance is the responsibility of senior management, the
Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory
compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally
meet corporate EHS & SR goals.



The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and
elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent
years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that have
already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and
additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in
diesel fuel went into effect in 2006. Additional reductions in
gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration.
Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more
stringent regulation in future years and as such may require
additional capital expenditures.

Estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with
low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading will
approximate $75 million, $23 million of which was
spent in 2005. The remainder is expected to be spent in 2006.
Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and
diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be
approximately $410 million in total, $160 million of
which has already been spent. Capital expenditures for
low-sulfur requirements are expected to be $200 million in
2006, with the remainder in 2007. HOVENSA plans to finance these
capital expenditures through cash flow from operations.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 eliminates the Clean Air
Act’s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated
gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific
quantities of renewable content in gasoline. Many states have
also enacted bans on the use of MTBE in gasoline, many of which
will take effect in 2007-2009. As a result, several companies
have announced their intention to cease using MTBE, since it
will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with
the Clean Air Act and does not meet the new renewable content
requirement. In response to these changes in the gasoline
marketplace, the Corporation and HOVENSA will phase out the use
of ether based oxygenates in the spring of 2006. The phase out
may adversely affect the amount and type of fuels produced at
HOVENSA and Port Reading. Both companies are reviewing the most
cost effective means to replace ether unit processing
capabilities, which may necessitate additional capital
investments. The Corporation and HOVENSA are preparing to meet
the renewable content requirement for gasoline and do not
anticipate that the impact of this requirement will be
significant.

As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in
2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the
U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining
Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is
designed to reduce certain air emissions at all
U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into
settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining
companies that control over 77% of the domestic refining
capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and depending
on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA
may experience increased capital expenditures and operating
expenses related to air emissions controls. Settlements with
other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several
years.

HOVENSA is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the
refinery. This project will significantly enhance the
refinery’s ability to treat wastewater and better protect
the marine environment of St. Croix. The cost to complete
the project is approximately $120 million, of which
$32 million has already been incurred.

The Corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the
environmental and social impact of air emissions. On a global
scale, climate change is an issue that has prompted much public
debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and
development. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess,
monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,”
including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated
with this program may be significant, not only from the
standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the
perspective of adequately measuring the Corporation’s
greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation has recently completed
a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better
measurement and control of “greenhouse gases.”

The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for
environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to
existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be
necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore
exploration and production facilities, refineries (including
solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not
currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the
Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party.



The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and
reasonably estimable. At year-end 2005, the Corporation’s
reserve for its estimated environmental liability was
approximately $77 million. The Corporation expects that
existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately
cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The
Corporation’s remediation spending was $15 million in
2005, $12 million in 2004 and $12 million in 2003.
Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with
federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for
low sulfur projects discussed above, were $3 million in
2005, $1 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003.

Forward Looking Information

Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including
references to the Corporation’s future results of
operations and financial position, liquidity and capital
resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax
rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and
environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and
contractual obligations and contingencies include forward
looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on
the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of
these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future.
Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of
changes in market conditions, government actions and other
factors.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as
non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading
operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a
trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to
commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil,
natural gas and refined products. The following describes how
these risks are controlled and managed.

Controls:

The Corporation maintains a control
environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and
through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s
senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric,
term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk
officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities.
Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to
business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s
risk management department also performs independent
verifications of sources of fair values and validations of
valuation models. These controls apply to all of the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including
the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s
treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and
interest rate hedging programs.

Instruments:

The Corporation primarily uses
forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts,
futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in
its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are
widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. The
following describes these instruments and how the Corporation
uses them:

•

Forward Commodity Contracts:

The forward purchase and
    sale of commodities is performed as part of the
    Corporation’s normal activities. At settlement date, the
    notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical
    delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated
    as normal purchase and sale contracts under
    FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market
    risk disclosures. In some cases, physical purchase and sale
    contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in
    trading results.

•

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:

Forward contracts
    include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound
    sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts
    commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound
    sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a
    certain date.



Value-at-Risk:

The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control
commodity risk within its trading and non-trading activities.
The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and the
results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day
at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and
second order sensitivities for options. The following table
summarizes the value-at-risk results for trading and non-trading
activities. These results may vary from time to time as
strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change
in non-trading activities.

Non-Trading:

The Corporation’s non-trading
activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas
production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices
of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the
related gains or losses are an integral part of the
Corporation’s selling prices. Following is a summary of the
Corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at
December 31, 2005:

26.90




There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production
at year end. As market conditions change, the Corporation may
adjust its hedge percentages. The Corporation also markets
energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural
gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to
manage the risk in its marketing activities.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
December 31, 2005 includes after-tax unrealized deferred
losses of $1,304 million primarily related to crude oil
contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales.
The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in
accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are
recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.

The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling
and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2005, the
Corporation has $677 million of notional value foreign
exchange contracts maturing in 2006 and 2007 ($476 million
at December 31, 2004). The fair value of the foreign
exchange contracts was a liability of $31 million at
December 31, 2005 (receivable of $49 million at
December 31, 2004). The change in fair value of the foreign
exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is
estimated to be $64 million at December 31, 2005
($53 million at December 31, 2004).

The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,785 million
has a fair value of $4,286 million at December 31,
2005 (debt of $3,835 million at December 31, 2004 had
a fair value of $4,327 million). A 15% change in the rate
of interest would change the fair value of debt by approximately
$250 million at December 31, 2005 and by approximately
$260 million at December 31, 2004.

Trading:

In trading activities, the Corporation is
exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product
prices. The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a
50% voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives.
The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of
the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions
for its own account. The information that follows represents
100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s
proprietary trading accounts.

Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are

marked-to

-market and
are reflected in income currently. Total realized losses for the
year amounted to $297 million ($79 million of realized
gains for 2004). The following table provides an assessment of
the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading
activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and
other trading activities.

The Corporation uses observable market values for determining
the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where
actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources
are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in
actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets
and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are
based on internal models incorporating underlying market
information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The
Corporation’s risk management department



regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rules

13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Amerada Hess Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Amerada Hess Corporation and
consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amerada Hess
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements of
consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in
preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value
and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated
February 24, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on these
statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Amerada Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements of
consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in
preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value
and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included
the Financial Statement Schedule listed in the Index at
Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated
subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related Financial Statement Schedule, when considered in
relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Amerada Hess Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:

Amerada Hess Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Corporation) engage in the exploration for and
the development, production, purchase, transportation and sale
of crude oil and natural gas. These activities are conducted in
the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Russia,
Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Gabon, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand, Libya and other countries. In addition, the
Corporation manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and
markets refined petroleum and other energy products. The
Corporation owns 50% of HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a refinery
joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands. An additional
refining facility, terminals and retail gasoline stations are
located on the East Coast of the United States.

In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in
the income statement. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Among the estimates made by management are oil and
gas reserves, asset valuations, depreciable lives, pension
liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, dismantlement
costs and income taxes.

Certain information in the financial statements and notes has
been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Amerada Hess
Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
consolidated.

Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned, including
HOVENSA, are stated at cost of acquisition plus the
Corporation’s equity in undistributed net income since
acquisition. The Corporation’s equity in net income of
these companies is included in non-operating income in the
income statement. The Corporation consolidates the trading
partnership in which it owns a 50% voting interest and over
which it exercises control.

Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
consolidation.

Revenue Recognition:

The Corporation recognizes
revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products and other merchandise when title passes to the
customer. The Corporation recognizes revenues from the
production of natural gas properties based on sales to
customers. Differences between natural gas volumes sold and the
Corporation’s share of natural gas production are not
material.

Sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes in the
consolidated statement of income, which amounted to
approximately $1,790 million, $1,650 million and
$1,590 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In its exploration and production activities, the Corporation
enters into crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the
same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one
another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality.
Similarly, in its marketing activities, the Corporation also
enters into refined product purchase and sale transactions with
the same counterparty. These arrangements are reported net in
the consolidated statement of income.

Derivatives (futures, forwards, options and swaps) used in
energy trading activities are marked to market, with net gains
and losses recorded in operating revenue. Gains or losses from
the sale of physical products are recorded at the time of sale.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents
consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily
convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or
less when acquired.



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories:

Crude oil and refined product
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. For
inventories valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally the

last-in,

first-out
(LIFO) inventory method.

Inventories of merchandise, materials and supplies are valued at
the lower of average cost or market.

Exploration and Development Costs:

Exploration and
production activities are accounted for using the successful
efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and
gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’
fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease
rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are
expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive
wells, including development dry holes, and related production
facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found. In accordance with FASB Staff
Position

19-1,

Accounting for Suspended Well Costs

, which amended
Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (FAS) No. 19,

Financial Accounting
and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies

,
exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is
completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity
of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and
(2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is
substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of
a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense.
Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the
economic and operating viability of a project include commitment
of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts
with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and
contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other
factors.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization:

The
Corporation calculates depletion expense for acquisition costs
of proved properties using the units of production method over
proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense
for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated
using the units of production method over proved developed oil
and gas reserves. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment
is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated
useful lives. Retail gas stations and equipment related to a
leased property, are depreciated over the estimated useful lives
not to exceed the remaining lease period. Provisions for
impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on
periodic evaluations and other factors.

Capitalized Interest:

Interest from external
borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the
weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the
project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from
the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful
lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of
the underlying assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The Corporation
accounts for asset retirement obligations as required by
FAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations

and FIN 47,

Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations

. Under these standards, a
liability is recognized for the fair value of legally required
asset retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets
in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred.
In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional
asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be
reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes the associated
asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived assets. On January 1, 2003, the effective date
of FAS No. 143, the cumulative effect of this
accounting change on prior years resulted in a credit to income
of $7 million or $.07 per share, basic and diluted.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The Corporation
reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas properties at a
field level, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
recovered. If the carrying amounts are not expected to be
recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the assets are
impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
determined by discounting anticipated future net



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the net present
value of future cash flows is based on management’s best
estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to
recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied
to projected production volumes of individual fields and
discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The
projected production volumes represent reserves, including
probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated
amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices
and timing of production are consistent with internal
projections and other externally reported information. Oil and
gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally
differ from the year-end prices used in the standardized measure
of discounted future net cash flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The Corporation
reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than
temporary decline in value has occurred. The amount of the
impairment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or
other valuation techniques.

Impairment of Goodwill:

In accordance with
FAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, goodwill cannot be amortized; however, it must be
tested annually for impairment. This impairment test is
calculated at the reporting unit level, which is the exploration
and production segment for the Corporation’s goodwill. The
Corporation identifies potential impairments by comparing the
fair value of the reporting unit to its book value, including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, the Corporation calculates the possible
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill
with the carrying amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill
is less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be
recorded.

Maintenance and Repairs:

Maintenance and repairs
are expensed as incurred. The estimated costs of refinery
turnarounds at the Port Reading facility are accrued. Capital
improvements are recorded as additions in property, plant and
equipment.

Environmental Expenditures:

The Corporation
capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or
efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent future
environmental contamination. The Corporation accrues and
expenses environmental costs to remediate existing conditions
related to past operations when the future costs are probable
and reasonably estimable.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Corporation records
compensation expense for restricted common stock awards ratably
over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2005, the
Corporation used the intrinsic value method to account for
employee stock options. Because the exercise prices of employee
stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the stock
on the date of grant, the Corporation did not recognize
compensation expense. Effective January 1, 2006, the
Corporation adopted FAS No. 123R,

Share-Based
Payment

, which requires that compensation expense be
recorded for all stock based payments to employees,



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

including grants of stock options (see note 9). The
following pro forma financial information presents the effect on
net income and earnings per share as if the Corporation used the
fair value method for stock options.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The U.S. dollar
is the functional currency (primary currency in which business
is conducted) for most foreign operations. For these operations,
adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets
and liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded in income.
For operations that use the local currency as the functional
currency, adjustments resulting from translating foreign
functional currency assets and liabilities into
U.S. dollars are recorded in a separate component of
stockholders’ equity entitled accumulated other
comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from
transactions in other than the functional currency are reflected
in net income.

Hedging:

The Corporation may use futures,
forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to
reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and
refined product prices. Related hedge gains or losses are an
integral part of the selling or purchase prices. Generally,
these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future
cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), and
the changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income. These transactions meet the requirements
for hedge accounting, including correlation. The
Corporation’s hedges are tested prospectively before they
are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an
on-going basis to ensure they continue to qualify for hedge
accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness
calculations are performed using a historical simulation model.
The simulation utilizes historical observable market data
consisting of futures curves and spot prices for the hedges.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has
$1,304 million of deferred hedging losses, after income
taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The
Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in
accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time
the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective portion
of hedges is included in current earnings. The
Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign
currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change
in fair value is included in income currently.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are determined
using the liability method. The Corporation regularly assesses
the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on estimates of
future taxable income, the availability of tax planning
strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the available
carryforward periods for net operating losses and other factors.
The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income
taxes

Exploration and Production:

In 2005, the Corporation sold
non-producing properties in the United Kingdom and exchanged a
mature North Sea asset for an increased interest in the Pangkah
natural gas development in Indonesia. In 2004, the Corporation
sold an office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non-producing
property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties.
In 2003, the Corporation sold its 1.5% interest in the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

In 2005, the Corporation incurred incremental expenses,
principally repair costs and insurance premiums, as a result of
hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are included in
production expenses in the income statement. The legal
settlement resulted from the favorable resolution of
contingencies on a prior year asset sale that is reflected in
non-operating income in the income statement.



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2003, the Corporation accrued severance and office costs of
$53 million. Of this amount, $32 million relates to
vacated leased office space in London and the remainder relates
to severance for positions that were eliminated in London,
Aberdeen and Houston. In 2004, the Corporation accrued an
additional $15 million for severance and vacated lease
costs in London. These expenses are reflected principally in
general and administrative expense in the income statement. The
Corporation has made total payments to date of approximately
$37 million reducing the accrual to $31 million at
December 31, 2005. The accrual was $39 million at
December 31, 2004.

The exploration and production income tax adjustments in 2005
reflect the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in
the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the
United Kingdom. In 2004, foreign income tax adjustments resulted
from a tax law change and a tax settlement. In 2003, the
Corporation recognized certain prior year foreign exploration
expenses for United States income tax purposes.

Marketing and Refining:

Earnings include income from the
liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories in 2005 and 2004. In
2005, earnings included a charge resulting from the bankruptcy
of a customer in the utility industry that is included in
marketing expenses in the income statement. In 2003, a loss was
recorded on the sale of a shipping joint venture.

Corporate:

In 2005 and 2003, expenses include charges for
premiums on bond repurchases, which are reflected in
non-operating income (expense) in the income statement. In
2004, the Corporation recorded $20 million of insurance
costs related to retrospective premium increases and a
$13 million income tax benefit arising from the settlement
of a federal tax audit.

3.

Discontinued Operations

In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing
properties in Colombia plus $10 million in cash, for an
additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in the Joint
Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand. In addition, the
Corporation sold, for aggregate proceeds of $445 million,
producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Jabung
field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom fields.
These disposals resulted in a net gain from asset sales of
$116 million and income from operations prior to sale was
$53 million. Income from discontinued operations of
$7 million in 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously
accrued contingency relating to the exchanged Colombian assets.

Refining Joint Venture

The Corporation has an investment in HOVENSA L.L.C., a
50% joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A.
(PDVSA), which is accounted for using the equity method. HOVENSA
owns and operates a refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Summarized financial information for HOVENSA as of
December 31 and for the years then ended follows:

Before Virgin Islands income taxes, which were recorded in
    the Corporation’s income tax provision.

During 2005 and 2004, the Corporation received cash
distributions from HOVENSA of $275 million and
$88 million, respectively. The Corporation’s share of
HOVENSA’s undistributed income at December 31, 2005
aggregated $499 million.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value
of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
PDVSA. At December 31, 2005, the guarantee amounted to
$135 million. This amount fluctuates based on the volume of
crude oil purchased and the related crude oil prices. In
addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a
maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have
funds to meet its senior debt obligations.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment at December 31 consists of
the following:

In 2005, the Corporation acquired a controlling interest in a
corporate joint venture operating in the Volga-Urals region of
Russia. Subsequent to the acquisition, this venture acquired
additional licenses and assets bringing the Corporation’s
total investment in Russia to approximately $400 million.
The primary reason for the Russian investments was to acquire
long-lived crude oil reserves. Production from the Russian
subsidiary averaged 6,000 barrels per day in 2005.
Substantially all of the acquisition cost was allocated to
unproved and proved properties.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31 consists of the following:

The aggregate long-term debt maturing during the next five years
is as follows (in millions): 2006 – $26 (included in
current liabilities); 2007 – $28; 2008 –
$30; 2009 – $744 and 2010 – $31.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation’s fixed rate
debentures have a principal amount of $2,816 million
($2,801 million net of unamortized discount). Interest
rates on the outstanding fixed rate debentures have a weighted
average rate of 7.3%. During 2005, the Corporation repurchased
$600 million of fixed rate debentures and fixed rate notes
at a premium of $39 million, before income taxes.

The Corporation has a $2.5 billion syndicated, revolving
credit facility expiring in December 2009, which can be used for
borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2005, the
Corporation has available capacity on the revolving credit
facility of $1,872 million. Borrowings under the facility
bear interest at .80% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A
facility fee of .20% per annum is payable on the amount of
the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject
to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a
financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings
and cash dividends. At December 31, 2005, the Corporation
is permitted to borrow up to an additional $6.7 billion for
the construction or acquisition of assets. At year-end, the
amount that can be borrowed for the payment of dividends or
stock repurchases is $2.5 billion. Under the
Corporation’s revolving credit agreement, if two stated
credit rating agencies classify the Corporation’s public
debt below investment grade, an additional covenant becomes
effective requiring that the Corporation’s ratio of total
consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined, shall not
exceed 3.5. The Corporation would have been in compliance with
this covenant had it been in effect for the year ended
December 31, 2005. This covenant shall

be deleted from the credit agreement if both credit rating
agencies’ ratings are simultaneously investment grade.

The total amount of interest paid (net of amounts capitalized),
principally on short-term and long-term debt, in 2005, 2004 and
2003 was $245 million, $243 million and
$313 million, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Corporation capitalized interest of $80 million,
$54 million and $41 million, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Corporation has outstanding restricted common stock and
stock options under its Amended and Restated 1995 Long-Term
Incentive Plan. Generally, stock options vest from one to three
years from the date of grant, have a 10-year option life, and
the exercise price equals or exceeds the market price on the
date of grant. Outstanding restricted common stock generally
vests three to five years from the date of grant.

The Corporation’s stock option activity consisted of the
following:

Exercise prices for employee stock options outstanding at
December 31, 2005 ranged from $45.81 to $137.35 per
share. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of
employee stock options is 7 years.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
fair value of employee stock options for pro forma disclosure of
the effects on net income and earnings per share. The
Corporation used the following weighted-average assumptions in
the Black-Scholes model for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively:
risk-free interest rates of 3.9%, 4.3% and 3.6%; expected stock
price volatility of .300, .293 and .288; dividend yield of 1.3%,
1.7% and 2.6%; and an expected life of seven years. The
weighted-average fair values per share of options granted for
which the exercise price equaled the market price on the date of
grant were $31.53 in 2005, $23.75 in 2004 and $12.60 in 2003.
The Corporation’s net income would have been reduced by
approximately $19 million in 2005, $7 million in 2004
and $1 million in 2003 if option expenses were recorded
using the fair value method.

In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
FAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123R). This new standard requires that
compensation expense for all stock-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the
income statement based on fair values. Had the Corporation
adopted FAS 123R in prior periods, the impact would have
approximated the additional expenses disclosed above and in the
table under Stock-Based Compensation in note 1. The
Corporation adopted FAS 123R as of January 1, 2006.
The actual cost of expensing stock options in 2006 and future
periods will be based on a number of factors, including the
amount of options granted, the terms of such awards and the
stock price at the time of grant. The Corporation estimates that
the cost of unvested options at December 31, 2005 and the
annual grant of employee stock options in February 2006 will
increase compensation expense in 2006 by approximately
$30 million, before income taxes.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency gains (losses) from continuing operations
before income taxes amounted to $(5) million in 2005,
$29 million in 2004 and $(6) million in 2003. The
balances in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
foreign currency translation were reductions in
stockholders’ equity of $92 million at
December 31, 2005 and $58 million at December 31,
2004.

Retirement Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
pension plans for substantially all of its employees. In
addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
plan covering certain employees. The unfunded supplemental
pension plan provides for incremental pension payments from the
Corporation’s funds so that total pension payments equal
amounts that would have been payable from the Corporation’s
principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by
income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based
on years of service and final average salary. The Corporation
uses December 31 as the measurement date for its plans.

The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for
each year were established at the end of each previous year
while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were
established at each year-end. The net periodic benefit cost and
the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations are
based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual
basis. The discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of
high-quality fixed-income investments that matches the maturity
of the plan obligations. The overall expected return on plan
assets is developed from the expected future returns for each
asset category, weighted by the expected allocation of pension
assets to that asset category. The Corporation engages an
independent investment consultant to assist in the development
of these expected returns.

The Corporation’s investment strategy is to maximize
returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad
diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes.
Asset classes and target allocations are determined by the
Company’s investment committee and include domestic and
foreign equities, fixed income securities, and other
investments, including hedge funds and private equity.
Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities
issued by the Corporation unless indirectly held as part of an
index strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid,
providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements.

The difference between the Corporation’s effective income
tax rate and the United States statutory rate is reconciled
below:

The American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) provided for a one-time
reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of
eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a
U.S. parent. During 2005, the Corporation repatriated
$1.9 billion of foreign dividends under the Act and
recorded a related income tax provision of approximately
$72 million.

The Corporation has not recorded deferred income taxes
applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations. The Corporation had undistributed earnings from
foreign subsidiaries of approximately $3.6 billion at
December 31, 2005. If the earnings of foreign subsidiaries
were not indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
approximately $1.2 billion would be required, excluding the
potential use of foreign tax credits.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has net operating
loss carryforwards in the United States of approximately
$3.6 billion, substantially all of which expire in 2022
through 2025. In addition, a foreign exploration and production
subsidiary has a net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $600 million, which can be carried forward
indefinitely. For income tax reporting at December 31,
2005, the Corporation has minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $85 million, which can be carried forward
indefinitely. The Corporation also has approximately
$45 million of general business credits, substantially all
of which expire between 2010 and 2025.

Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2005, 2004 and 2003
amounted to $1,139 million, $632 million and
$361 million, respectively.

common stock for each share of preferred, if the common stock
price is $60.20 or greater, and 1.0299 shares of common
stock for each share of preferred, if the common stock price is
$48.55 or less. The conversion ratio will change ratably from
..8305 to 1.0299 shares, if the average common stock price
is between $60.20 and $48.55. The Corporation has reserved
13,903,650 shares of common stock for the conversion of
these preferred shares. Holders of the cumulative mandatory

Financial Instruments, Non-trading and Trading Activities

Non-Trading:

FAS No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, requires
that the Corporation recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for using
derivatives as hedges. The Corporation reclassifies hedging
gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to
earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized.
Hedging decreased exploration and production results by
$1,582 million before income taxes in 2005,
$935 million in 2004 and $418 million in 2003. The
amount of hedge ineffectiveness reflected in income in 2005 was
$17 million, before income taxes and was not material
during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

losses in accumulated other comprehensive income from the
Corporation’s hedging contracts were $1,304 million
($2,063 million before income taxes). At December 31,
2004, net after-tax deferred losses were $869 million
($1,365 million before income taxes). The pre-tax amount of
all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and
the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax
assets on the balance sheet.

Commodity Trading:

The Corporation, principally
through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities,
including futures, forwards, options, swaps and energy commodity
based securities, based on expectations of future market
conditions. The Corporation’s income before income taxes
from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of
the trading partnership amounted to $60 million in 2005,
$72 million in 2004 and $30 million in 2003.

Other Financial Instruments:

Foreign currency
contracts are used to protect the Corporation from fluctuations
in exchange rates. The Corporation enters into foreign currency
contracts, which are not designated as hedges, and the change in
fair value is included in income currently. The Corporation has
$677 million of notional value foreign currency forward
contracts maturing through 2007, ($476 million at
December 31, 2004). Notional amounts do not quantify risk
or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are
used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts.
The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts
recorded by the Corporation was a liability of $31 million
at December 31, 2005 and a receivable of $49 million
at December 31, 2004.

The Corporation has $2,685 million in letters of credit
outstanding at December 31, 2005 ($1,487 million at
December 31, 2004). Of the total letters of credit
outstanding at December 31, 2005, $73 million relates
to contingent liabilities and the remaining $2,612 million
relates to liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.

Fair Value Disclosure:

The Corporation estimates
the fair value of its fixed-rate notes receivable and debt
generally using discounted cash flow analysis based on current
interest rates for instruments with similar maturities and risk
profiles. Foreign currency exchange contracts are valued based
on current termination values or quoted market prices of
comparable contracts. The Corporation’s valuation of
commodity contracts considers quoted market prices where
applicable. In the absence of quoted market prices, the
Corporation values contracts at fair value considering time
value, volatility of the underlying commodities and other
factors.

certain counterparties by using master netting agreements and
requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.

In its trading activities the Corporation has net receivables of
$562 million at December 31, 2005, which are
concentrated with counterparties as follows: domestic and
foreign trading companies – 42%, banks and major
financial institutions – 24% and gas and power
companies – 12%.

Guarantees and Contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Corporation provides
guarantees for investees of the Corporation. These guarantees
are contingent commitments that ensure performance for repayment
of borrowings and other arrangements. The Corporation’s
guarantees include $40 million of HOVENSA’s senior
debt obligations and $135 million of HOVENSA’s crude
oil purchases (see note 5). The remainder relates to a loan
guarantee of $58 million for an oil pipeline in which the
Corporation owns a 2.36% interest. The guarantee of the crude
oil pipeline will be in place through the end of pipeline
construction, which the Corporation expects to be in 2006. In
addition, the Corporation has $73 million in letters of
credit for which it is contingently liable. The maximum
potential amount of future payments that the Corporation could
be required to make under its guarantees at December 31,
2005 is $306 million ($309 million at
December 31, 2004). The Corporation has a contingent
purchase obligation expiring in April 2010, to acquire the
remaining interest in a retail marketing and gasoline station
joint venture for approximately $140 million.



AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to
various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the
Corporation’s consolidated financial statements when it is
probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable but the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is
only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however,
the Corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies in
accordance with FAS No. 5,

Accounting for
Contingencies.

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
refining and marketing of gasoline, is a party to numerous
lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) in gasoline. These cases have been
consolidated in the Southern District of New York. The principal
allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing MTBE is a
defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in
proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to
groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action
to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases
of MTBE. In some cases, punitive damages are also sought. In
April 2005, the District Court denied the primary legal aspects
of the defendants’ motion to dismiss these actions. While
the damages claimed in these actions are substantial, and it is
reasonably possible that a liability may have been incurred,
only limited information is available to evaluate the factual
and legal merits of these claims. The Corporation also believes
that significant legal uncertainty remains regarding the
validity of causes of action asserted and availability of the
relief sought by plaintiffs. Accordingly, based on the
information currently available, there is insufficient
information on which to evaluate the Corporation’s exposure
in these cases.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
consent agreements to resolve assertions by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) that refining facilities were
modified or expanded without complying with New Source Review
regulations that require permits and new emission controls in
certain circumstances and other regulations that impose
emissions control requirements. These consent agreements, which
arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum
refiners and utilities, have typically imposed substantial civil
fines and penalties and required significant capital
expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three
to eight year time period. The penalties assessed and the
capital expenditures required vary considerably between
refineries. The EPA initially contacted the Corporation and
HOVENSA regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in August
2003 and discussions resumed in August 2005. While it is
reasonably possible additional capital expenditures and
operating expenses may be incurred in the future, the amounts
cannot be estimated at this time. The amount of penalties, if
any, is not expected to be material to the financial position or
results of operations of the Corporation.

The Corporation is also currently subject to certain other
existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings, which it considers
routine and incidental to its business. The Corporation believes
that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related
to any of these other known contingent liability exposures would
have a material adverse impact on its financial position or
results of operations.

Segment Information

The Corporation has two operating segments that comprise the
structure used by senior management to make key operating
decisions and assess performance. These are (1) exploration
and production and (2) marketing and refining. Exploration
and production operations include the exploration for and the
development, production, purchase, transportation and sale of
crude oil and natural gas. Marketing and refining operations
include the manufacture, purchase, transportation, trading and
marketing of petroleum and other energy products.

in 2004 and $2,040 million in 2003. The Corporation sold
crude oil to HOVENSA totaling approximately $100 million in
2005, $35 million in 2004 and $410 million in 2003. In
addition, the Corporation billed HOVENSA freight charter costs
of $8 million in 2005, $75 million in 2004 and
$59 million in 2003.

The Corporation sold gasoline to a related retail marketing and

Subsequent Events

In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis
Group partners, re-entered its former oil and gas production
operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. The re-entry terms
include a

25-year

extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold
an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the
Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In
addition, the Corporation will make a payment of
$106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets
made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006
production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to
25,000 barrels of oil per day.

In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a 55% working interest
in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1
Concession (the West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million.
The Corporation has a 25-year development lease for the West Med
Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and
additional exploration opportunities.

In 2006, the Corporation will complete the sale of its interests
in certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in
West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million, before purchase
price adjustments. The net book value of these assets held for
sale of approximately $70 million has been recorded in
other current assets at December 31, 2005. The Corporation
estimates that it will record an after-tax gain of
$160 million to $180 million in the first quarter on
the sale of these assets.

Oil and Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
producible; government approvals must be obtained and depending
on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the
board of directors, must commit to fund the project. The
Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting
process involves an annual independent third party reserve
determination as well as internal technical appraisals of
reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the
estimates.

The oil and gas reserve estimates reported below are determined
independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton
(D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually,
the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological
and geophysical data, actual production histories and other
information necessary for the reserve determination. The
Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to
review and discuss the information provided. Senior management
and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates
issued by D&M.





Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying year-end oil
and gas selling prices (adjusted for price changes provided by
contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of
proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development
and production costs, which are based on year-end costs and
existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are
computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax
rates to the pre-tax net cash flows relating to the
Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash
flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The
discounted future net cash flow estimates required by
FAS No. 69 do not include exploration expenses,
interest expense or corporate general and administrative
expenses. The selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are
highly volatile. The year-end prices, which are required to be
used for the discounted future net cash flows and do not include
the effects of hedges, may not be representative of future
selling prices. The future net cash flow estimates could be
materially different if other assumptions were used.
