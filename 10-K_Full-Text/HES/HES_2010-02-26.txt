A description of our significant E&P operations follows:

United
    States

At December 31, 2009, 21% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in the United States. During 2009,
    24% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids
    production and 13% of its natural gas production were from
    United States operations. The Corporation’s production in
    the United States was principally from properties offshore in
    the Gulf of Mexico, which include the Shenzi (Hess 28%), Llano
    (Hess 50%), Conger (Hess 38%), Baldpate (Hess 50%), Hack Wilson
    (Hess 25%) and Penn State (Hess 50%) fields, as well as onshore
    properties in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and in the
    Permian Basin of Texas.

In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production commenced at the
    Shenzi Field in March 2009. Net production from Shenzi averaged
    approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
    (boepd) in 2009. The operator plans on drilling additional
    production wells at Shenzi in 2010.

In North Dakota, the Corporation holds a net acreage position in
    the Bakken shale play of approximately 510,000 acres. In
    2009, the Corporation sanctioned a development program for the
    Bakken. The Corporation plans to expand production facilities
    and increase the rig count to 10 from 3 over the next
    18 months, and invest about $1 billion per year over
    the next five years. As a result, the Corporation projects an
    increase in net production from approximately 10,000 boepd in
    2009 to approximately 80,000 boepd in 2015.

The Corporation is developing a residual oil zone at the
    Seminole-San Andres Unit (Hess 34%) in Texas where carbon
    dioxide gas supplied from its interests in the West Bravo Dome
    and Bravo Dome fields in New Mexico is being injected to enhance
    recovery of crude oil.

At the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%)
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, engineering and design work for
    field development progressed during 2009. The Corporation plans
    to drill an appraisal well on Green Canyon Block 469 in
    2010.

In 2009 the Corporation acquired rights to explore a total of
    more than 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus gas shale
    formation in Pennsylvania. The Corporation is operator and holds
    a 100% interest on approximately 50,000 acres and holds a
    50% non-operated interest in the remaining acreage. Exploration
    drilling activity is expected to commence in 2010.

At December 31, 2009, the Corporation had interests in 331
    total blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, of which 292 were
    exploration blocks comprising 1.1 million net undeveloped
    acres and the remainder were held for production and development
    operations.

Europe

At December 31, 2009, 30% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in Europe (United Kingdom 8%,
    Norway 13%, Denmark 3% and Russia 6%). During 2009, 29% of the
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
    and 22% of its natural gas production were from European
    operations.



United Kingdom:

Production of crude oil
    and natural gas liquids from the United Kingdom North Sea was
    principally from the Corporation’s non-operated interests
    in the Nevis (Hess 39%), Schiehallion (Hess 16%), Clair (Hess
    9%), Bittern (Hess 28%) and Beryl (Hess 22%) fields. Natural gas
    production from the United Kingdom was primarily from the
    Easington Catchment Area (Hess 32%), Bacton area (Hess 22%),
    Beryl (Hess 22%), Everest (Hess 19%), Lomond (Hess 17%), Nevis
    (Hess 39%), Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) fields.
    The operator plans to drill additional production wells at Beryl
    in 2010.

Norway:

Substantially all of the 2009
    and 2008 Norwegian production was from the Corporation’s
    interest in the Valhall Field (Hess 28%). A field redevelopment
    for Valhall commenced in 2007 and is expected to be completed in
    2011. In 2010, the operator plans on drilling additional
    production and injection wells at Valhall. Additionally in 2010,
    the operator will continue to work on the Valhall Flank Gas Lift
    project, which was sanctioned in 2009 and is expected to be
    completed in 2011. The Corporation also holds an interest in the
    Snohvit (Hess 3%), Snorre (Hess 1%) and Hod (Hess 25%) fields.
    All four of the Corporation’s Norwegian field interests are
    located offshore.

In December 2009, the Corporation agreed to a strategic exchange
    of all of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the
    United Kingdom for an additional 28% interest in Valhall and 25%
    interest in Hod. The transaction, which has an effective date of
    January 1, 2010, is subject to various regulatory and other
    approvals. In addition, the partners are in discussions
    regarding the applicability of pre-emption to this transaction.

Denmark:

Crude oil and natural gas
    production comes from the Corporation’s interest in the
    South Arne Field (Hess 58%). In 2010, the Corporation plans a
    two well production drilling program.

Russia:

The Corporation’s
    activities in the Russian Federation are conducted through its
    80% interest in a subsidiary operating in the Volga-Urals region
    of Russia. As of December 31, 2009, this subsidiary had
    exploration and production rights in 13 license areas in the
    Samara Oblast. In December 2009 this subsidiary also secured
    rights in the Novomaliklinsky license area, which lies in the
    Ulyanovsk Oblast. Production currently comes from ten license
    areas, but exploration and development investment is planned in
    all 14 license areas.

Africa

At December 31, 2009, 23% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in Africa (Equatorial Guinea 8%,
    Algeria 2%, Libya 11% and Gabon 2%). During 2009, 41% of the
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas liquids production
    was from African operations.

Equatorial Guinea:

The Corporation is
    the operator and owns an interest in Block G (Hess 85%) which
    contains the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex. The Corporation
    plans to drill additional production wells at Okume in 2010.

Algeria:

The Corporation has a 49%
    interest in a venture with the Algerian national oil company,
    that redeveloped three oil fields.

Libya:

The Corporation, in conjunction
    with its Oasis Group partners, has oil and gas production
    operations in the Waha concessions in Libya (Hess 8%). The
    Corporation also owns a 100% interest in offshore exploration
    Area 54 in the Mediterranean Sea, where a successful exploration
    well was drilled in 2008. In 2009, the Corporation successfully
    flow tested the first exploration well and subsequently drilled
    and successfully flow tested a down-dip appraisal well. In 2010,
    the Corporation plans to reprocess 3D seismic, integrating
    acquired well information, and will continue technical and
    commercial evaluation of the block.

Gabon:

The Corporation’s
    activities in Gabon are conducted through its wholly-owned
    Gabonese subsidiary, where the Corporation has interests in the
    Rabi Kounga, Toucan and Atora fields. In the fourth quarter of
    2009, the Corporation agreed to a strategic exchange of all of
    its interests in Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall
    and Hod fields offshore Norway.

Egypt:

The Corporation has an interest
    in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med
    Block) (Hess 55%), which contains natural gas discoveries and
    additional exploration opportunities. The Corporation is
    currently evaluating technical and commercial options for this
    block and further exploratory drilling is planned. The
    Corporation also owns a 100% interest in Block 1 offshore
    Egypt in the Red Sea. During 2009 the Corporation acquired and
    completed the reprocessing of seismic data for this block.



Ghana:

The Corporation holds a 100%
    interest in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points License. The
    Corporation is evaluating 3D seismic in anticipation of drilling
    the second exploration well on this prospect in late 2010 or
    early 2011.

Asia and
    Other

At December 31, 2009, 26% of the Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were located in the Asia and other region (JDA
    11%, Indonesia 9%, Thailand 3%, Azerbaijan 2% and Malaysia 1%).
    During 2009, 6% of the Corporation’s crude oil and natural
    gas liquids production and 65% of its natural gas production
    were from Asia and other operations.

Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand
    (JDA):

The Corporation owns an interest in
    Block

A-18

of the JDA (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand. Phase 2 gas sales
    commenced in November of 2008. In 2009, the Corporation acquired
    a 50% interest in Blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are
    adjacent to Block

A-18

of the
    JDA.

Indonesia:

The Corporation’s
    natural gas production in Indonesia primarily comes from its
    interests offshore in the Ujung Pangkah project (Hess 75%),
    which commenced production in 2007, and the Natuna A Field (Hess
    23%). Additional production from a Phase 2 oil project at Ujung
    Pangkah commenced in 2009. The Corporation also owned an
    interest in the onshore Jambi Merang natural gas development
    project (Hess 25%), which was sold in January 2010. In May 2009,
    the Corporation obtained a 100% working interest in the offshore
    South Sesulu Block, where the Corporation is planning to acquire
    and process seismic in 2010. The Corporation also holds a 100%
    working interest in the offshore Semai V Block, where the
    Corporation is evaluating seismic and plans to drill an
    exploration well in late 2010 or early 2011.

Thailand:

The Corporation’s
    natural gas production in Thailand primarily comes from the
    offshore Pailin Field (Hess 15%) and the onshore Sinphuhorm
    Block (Hess 35%).

Azerbaijan:

The Corporation has an
    interest in the Azeri-Chriag-Gunashli (ACG) fields (Hess 3%) in
    the Caspian Sea. In 2010, production drilling will continue and
    the operator will seek sanction to install an additional
    production and drilling platform, which will include processing
    facilities and related infrastructure.

Australia:

The Corporation holds a 100%
    interest in an exploration license covering 780,000 acres
    in the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia (WA-390-P
    Block). Through December 31, 2009, the Corporation has
    drilled 11 of the 16 commitment wells on the block, nine of
    which were natural gas discoveries. The Corporation plans to
    drill the remaining five commitment wells on the block in 2010.
    The Corporation also holds a 50% interest in WA-404-P Block
    located offshore Western Australia, which covers a total area of
    680,000 acres. The operator completed a successful
    exploration well on this block in 2009 and plans to drill the
    remaining eight commitment wells on this block in 2010. In
    January 2010, the operator announced that the first well of the
    2010 program discovered natural gas.

Brazil:

The Corporation has interests
    in two blocks located offshore Brazil, BM-S-22 (Hess 40%) and
    BM-ES-30 (Hess 30%). In 2009, two exploration wells were
    completed on BM-S-22. A notice of discovery was filed for the
    first well and the second well was expensed. In 2010, the
    operator of BM-S-22 plans to commence drilling of a third
    exploration well in the second half of the year. In 2009, the
    Corporation also drilled an exploration well on BM-ES-30, which
    was expensed.

Peru:

The Corporation has an interest
    in Block 64 in Peru (Hess 50%). At the end of 2009, the
    Corporation was drilling a sidetrack to an exploration well on
    this block. Further evaluation work is planned for 2010.

Colombia:

The Corporation has interests
    in offshore Blocks RC 6 and RC 7 (Hess 30%). During 2009 the
    Corporation acquired 3D seismic for those blocks. Additional 3D
    seismic will be acquired and processed in 2010.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas reserves at the
    end of 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented under the Supplementary
    Oil and Gas Data on pages 77 through 84 in the accompanying
    financial statements.

During 2009, the Corporation provided oil and gas reserve
    estimates for 2008 to the United States Department of Energy.
    Such estimates are consistent with the information furnished to
    the SEC on

Form 10-K

for the year ended



December 31, 2008, although not necessarily directly
    comparable due to the requirements of the individual requests.
    There were no differences in excess of 5%.

Sales commitments:

The Corporation has
    no contracts or agreements to sell fixed quantities of its crude
    oil production. In the United States, natural gas is marketed by
    the M&R segment on a spot basis and under contracts for
    varying periods of time to local distribution companies, and
    commercial, industrial and other purchasers. The
    Corporation’s United States natural gas production is
    expected to approximate 30% of its 2010 sales commitments under
    long-term contracts. The Corporation attempts to minimize supply
    risks associated with its United States natural gas supply
    commitments by entering into purchase contracts with third
    parties having reliable sources of supply and by leasing storage
    facilities.

Outside of the United States and the United Kingdom, the
    Corporation generally sells its natural gas production under
    long-term sales contracts at prices that are periodically
    adjusted due to changes in commodity prices or other indices.

    with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In
    addition, it owns and operates a refining facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey.

HOVENSA:

Refining operations at HOVENSA
    consist of crude units, a fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCC)
    and a delayed coker unit.

The following table summarizes capacity and utilization rates
    for HOVENSA:

The delayed coker unit permits HOVENSA to run lower-cost heavy
    crude oil. HOVENSA has a long-term supply contract with PDVSA to
    purchase 115,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy
    crude oil. PDVSA also supplies 155,000 barrels per day of
    Venezuelan Mesa medium gravity crude oil to HOVENSA under a
    long-term crude oil supply contract. The remaining crude oil
    requirements are purchased mainly under contracts of one year or
    less from third parties and through spot purchases on the open
    market. After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third
    parties, the Corporation purchases 50% of HOVENSA’s
    remaining production at market prices.

Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 402,000 barrels per
    day in 2009 compared with 441,000 barrels per day in 2008
    and 454,000 barrels per day in 2007. The 2009 and 2008
    utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins
    and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization
    rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar.
    In January 2010, HOVENSA commenced a turnaround of its FCC unit
    which is expected to take approximately 40 days.

Port Reading Facility:

The Corporation
    owns and operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
    Reading, New Jersey, with a capacity of 70,000 barrels per
    day. This facility, which processes residual fuel oil and vacuum
    gas oil, operated at a rate of approximately 63,000 barrels
    per day in 2009 compared with 64,000 barrels per day in
    2008 and 61,000 barrels per day in 2007. Substantially all
    of Port Reading’s production is gasoline and heating oil.
    The Corporation is planning a turnaround for the Port Reading
    refining facility in the second quarter of 2010, which is
    expected to take approximately 35 days.



Marketing

The Corporation markets refined petroleum products, natural gas
    and electricity on the East Coast of the United States to the
    motoring public, wholesale distributors, industrial and
    commercial users, other petroleum companies, governmental
    agencies and public utilities.

The Corporation had 1,357
    HESS

®

gasoline stations at December 31, 2009, including stations
    owned by its WilcoHess joint venture (Hess 44%). Approximately
    92% of the gasoline stations are operated by the Corporation or
    WilcoHess. Of the operated stations, 94% have convenience stores
    on the sites. Most of the Corporation’s gasoline stations
    are in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida,
    Massachusetts, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Of total refined products sold
    in 2009 approximately 45% was obtained from HOVENSA and Port
    Reading and in 2008 and 2007 approximately 50% was obtained from
    HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation purchased the balance
    from third parties under short-term supply contracts and spot
    purchases.

The Corporation owns 20 terminals with an aggregate storage
    capacity of 22 million barrels in its East Coast marketing
    areas. The Corporation also owns a terminal in St. Lucia with a
    storage capacity of 9 million barrels, which is operated
    for third party storage.

The Corporation has a 50% interest in Bayonne Energy Center,
    LLC, a joint venture that plans to build a natural gas fired
    electric generating station on property owned by Hess in
    Bayonne, New Jersey. The joint venture will sell electricity
    into the New York City market by a direct connection with the
    Con Edison Gowanus substation. Construction of the facility is
    scheduled to begin in mid-2010 and operations are to commence in
    late 2011.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
    Corporation also takes energy commodity and derivative trading
    positions for its own account.

Majority-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation are pursuing
    investments in liquified natural gas regasification terminals
    and related supply, trading and marketing opportunities.
    Necessary regulatory approvals are being pursued for terminal
    projects on owned properties located in Fall River,
    Massachusetts, and Shannon, Ireland. In 2009 the Corporation
    leased property, with an option to purchase, in Logan Township,
    New Jersey for potential regasification facilities. In addition,
    a subsidiary of the Corporation is exploring the development of
    fuel cell technology.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors Related to Our Business and Operations

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant risk factors, including those described
    below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect
    our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of
    operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our
    securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is
    possible additional risks relating to our securities may be
    described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in
    the future.

Commodity Price Risk:

Our estimated proved
    reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins,
    future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on
    the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum
    products, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our
    control. Historically these prices have been very volatile and
    most recently have been affected by changes in demand associated
    with the global economic downturn. The major foreign oil
    producing countries, including members of the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert considerable
    influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined
    petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a
    common policy on rates of production and other matters has a
    significant impact on the oil markets. The commodities trading
    markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil,
    natural gas and refined petroleum products. To the extent that
    we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price
    volatility, we may not realize the benefit of price increases
    above the hedged price. Changes in commodity prices can also
    have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements
    under our derivative contracts. In addition, we utilize
    significant bank credit facilities to support these collateral
    and margin requirements. An inability to renew or replace such
    credit facilities as they mature would negatively impact our
    liquidity.

Technical Risk:

We own or have access to a
    finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted
    over time. Replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to
    successful exploration drilling, development activities, and
    enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas
    production is dependent on technical success in finding and
    developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity
    involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and
    geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the
    presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling
    risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in
    pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather
    interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen
    reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or
    flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities
    have increased in recent years which could negatively affect
    expected economic returns. Reserve replacement can also be
    achieved through acquisition. Although due diligence is used in
    evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar risks may be
    encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties
    acquired from others.



Oil and Gas Reserves and Discounted Future Net Cash Flow
    Risks:

Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating
    quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those
    reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices,
    revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and
    quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary
    substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could
    materially affect the estimated quantities and future net
    revenues of our proved reserves. In addition, reserve estimates
    may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on
    production performance, purchases or sales of properties,
    results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices,
    production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as
    crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors.

Political Risk:

Federal, state, local,
    territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax
    increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation or
    nationalization of property, mandatory government participation,
    cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in
    import regulations, limitations on access to exploration and
    development opportunities, as well as other political
    developments may affect our operations. Some of the
    international areas in which we operate and the partners with
    whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas
    and partners. The threat of terrorism around the world also
    poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas
    industry. We market motor fuels through lessee-dealers and
    wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits
    producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in
    retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been
    periodically proposed in various other states.

Environmental Risk:

Our oil and gas
    operations, like those of the industry, are subject to
    environmental risk such as oil spills, produced water spills,
    gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases
    that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or
    other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to
    numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign
    environmental laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these
    laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or
    criminal penalties, remedial

clean-ups

and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition,
    increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly
    relating to the production of motor and other fuels have
    resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital
    expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas
    industry in general.

Climate Change Risk:

We recognize that climate
    change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political
    and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted
    in both existing and pending international agreements and
    national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures
    to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures
    may require significant equipment modifications, operational
    changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce
    emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, as a result of
    which we may incur substantial capital expenditures and
    compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In
    addition, we manufacture petroleum fuels, which through normal
    customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases.
    Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may
    reduce our sales of, and revenues from, these products. Finally,
    to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme
    weather related events, we could experience increased costs
    related to prevention, maintenance and remediation of affected
    operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to
    delays and shutdowns.

Competitive Risk:

The petroleum industry is
    highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter
    competition from numerous companies in each of our activities,
    including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural
    gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined products,
    natural gas and electricity. Many competitors, including
    national oil companies, are larger and have substantially
    greater resources. We are also in competition with producers and
    marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for
    worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the
    cost of acquisitions. In addition, competition for drilling
    services, technical expertise and equipment has, in the recent
    past, affected the availability of technical personnel and
    drilling rigs and has therefore increased capital and operating
    costs.

Catastrophic Risk:

Although we maintain a
    level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices
    against property and casualty losses, our oil and gas operations
    are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or
    destroy assets or interrupt operations. Examples of catastrophic
    risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts. These
    occurrences have affected us from time to time.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving
    water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in
    jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE
    and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE,
    including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases
    is that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that
    these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share
    of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and
    are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged
    effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the
    majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In
    February 2010, the Corporation reached an agreement in principle
    to settle all but three of the remaining cases. The three
    unresolved cases consist of two cases that have been
    consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the Southern District of
    New York as part of a multi-district litigation proceeding and
    an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire.
    In 2007, a pre-tax charge of $40 million was recorded to
    cover all of the known MTBE cases against the Corporation.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries
    covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on
    the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of
    the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has
    previously installed more advanced pollution controls. The EPA
    initially contacted the Corporation and HOVENSA regarding the
    Petroleum Refinery Initiative in August 2003. Negotiations with
    the EPA and the relevant states and the Virgin Islands are
    continuing and substantial progress has been made toward
    resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA.
    While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining
    Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is
    reached and entered by a court, additional significant future
    capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be
    incurred by HOVENSA over a number of years. The amount of
    penalties, if any, is not expected to be material.

On September 13, 2007, HOVENSA received a Notice Of
    Violation (NOV) pursuant to section 113(a)(i) of the Clean
    Air Act (Act) from the EPA finding that HOVENSA failed to obtain
    proper permitting for the construction and operation of its
    delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and
    regulations. HOVENSA believes it properly obtained all necessary
    permits for this project. The NOV states that the EPA has
    authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties
    for violation of the Act. HOVENSA has entered into discussions
    with the EPA to reach resolution of this matter. The Corporation
    does not believe that this matter will result in material
    liability to HOVENSA or the Corporation.

In December 2006, HOVENSA received a NOV from the EPA alleging
    non-compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the
    Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources
    (DPNR) for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit.
    The NOV was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and
    submission by HOVENSA regarding potential non-compliance with
    the permit emissions limits for two pollutants. Any exceedances
    were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants
    emitted in excess of the limits. HOVENSA has entered into
    discussions with the appropriate governmental agencies to reach
    resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will
    result in material liability to HOVENSA or the Corporation.

The Corporation received a directive from the New Jersey
    Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate
    contamination in the sediments of the lower Passaic River and
    NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive,
    insofar as it affects the Corporation, relates to alleged
    releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New
    Jersey now owned by the Corporation. The Corporation and over
    70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on
    Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination. NJDEP has
    also sued several other companies linked to a facility
    considered by the State to be the largest contributor to river



contamination. In January 2009, these companies added third
    party defendants, including the Corporation, to that case. In
    June 2007, the EPA issued a draft study which evaluated six
    alternatives for early action, with costs ranging from
    $900 million to $2.3 billion. Based on adverse
    comments from the Corporation and others, the EPA is
    reevaluating its alternatives. In addition, the federal trustees
    for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of
    damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given the
    ongoing studies, remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at
    this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, the
    Corporation does not believe that this matter will result in
    material liability because its terminal could not have
    contributed contamination along most of the river’s length
    and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest
    concern in the river sediments, and because there are numerous
    other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation
    and damages.

In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly
    owned subsidiary of the Corporation, and HOVENSA, each received
    a letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department
    of Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources
    Trustees, advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit
    against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
    alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
    damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous
    substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
    currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south
    shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had
    been operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed
    on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands
    against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated
    industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix
    asserting that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and
    territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural
    resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA do not believe that this matter
    will result in a material liability as they believe that they
    have strong defenses to this complaint, and they intend to
    vigorously defend this matter.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notified the
    Corporation that on July 21, 2005 it commenced a private
    investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial
    Guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of
    the government of Equatorial Guinea. In 2009, the SEC advised
    that it had completed its investigation and did not intend to
    recommend enforcement action against the Corporation.

The Corporation periodically receives notices from EPA that it
    is a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
    legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
    this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
    jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
    claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation
    relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With
    respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s claims have been
    settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all
    cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of
    these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private
    parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot
    be predicted at this time due to the large number of other
    potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of

clean-up

cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
    and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
    to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of
    these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of
    them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such
    proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of
    the SEC. In management’s opinion, based upon currently
    known facts and circumstances, such proceedings in the aggregate
    will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
    condition of the Corporation.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
    operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P)
    and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment
    explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and
    sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment
    manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets
    and trades, refined petroleum products, natural gas and
    electricity.

Net income in 2009 was $740 million compared with
    $2,360 million in 2008 and $1,832 million in 2007.
    Diluted earnings per share were $2.27 in 2009 compared with
    $7.24 in 2008 and $5.74 in 2007. A table of items affecting
    comparability between periods is shown on page 20.

Exploration
    and Production

The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to
    profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and
    financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total
    proved reserves were 1,437 million barrels of oil
    equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2009 compared with
    1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008 and
    1,330 million boe at December 31, 2007. Total proved
    reserves additions for 2009 were 157 million boe. These
    additions replaced approximately 103% of the Corporation’s
    2009 production.

E&P net income was $1,042 million in 2009,
    $2,423 million in 2008 and $1,842 million in 2007.
    Average realized crude oil selling prices were $51.62 per barrel
    in 2009, $82.04 in 2008, and $63.44 in 2007, including the
    impact of hedging. The variance in E&P earnings between
    years was primarily driven by the fluctuations in average
    realized crude oil selling prices.

Production averaged 408,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
    day (boepd) in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and
    377,000 boepd in 2007. Production in 2009 increased 27,000 boepd
    or 7% from 2008. In 2010, the Corporation currently estimates
    total worldwide production will average between 400,000 and
    410,000 boepd.

The following is an update of significant E&P activities
    during 2009:

•

In March, production commenced at the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from Shenzi
    averaged approximately 25,000 boepd for 2009.

•

The Corporation sanctioned the Bakken shale play development in
    the Williston Basin of North Dakota. The Corporation plans to
    expand production facilities and increase the rig count to 10
    from 3 over the next 18 months, and invest about
    $1 billion per year over the next five years. As a result,
    the Corporation projects an increase in net production from
    approximately 10,000 boepd in 2009 to approximately 80,000 boepd
    in 2015.

•

In December 2009, the Corporation agreed to a strategic exchange
    of all of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field (Hess 9%)
    in the United Kingdom for an additional 28% interest in the
    Valhall Field (currently Hess 28%) and an additional 25%
    interest in the Hod Field (currently Hess 25%), which are both
    offshore Norway. The transaction which has an effective date of
    January 1, 2010, is subject to various regulatory and other
    approvals. In addition, the partners are in discussions
    regarding the applicability of pre-emption to this transaction.

•

In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the
    Corporation drilled seven exploration wells in 2009 on WA-390-P
    Block (Hess 100%), six of which were natural gas discoveries.
    Through December 31, 2009, the Corporation has drilled 11
    of the 16 commitment wells on the block, nine of which were
    natural gas discoveries. The Corporation plans to drill the
    remaining five commitment wells on the block in 2010. On
    WA-404-P Block (Hess 50%), the operator completed a successful
    exploration well in 2009 and plans to drill the remaining eight
    commitment wells in 2010. In January 2010, the operator
    announced that the first well of the 2010 program discovered
    natural gas.

•

At the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%)
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, engineering and design work for
    field development progressed during 2009. The Corporation plans
    to drill an appraisal well on Green Canyon Block 469 in
    2010.

•

Two exploration wells were completed on Block BM-S-22 (Hess 40%)
    offshore Brazil. A notice of discovery was filed for the first
    well and the second well was expensed. In 2010, the operator of
    BM-S-22



plans to commence drilling of a third exploration well in the
    second half of the year. In 2009, the Corporation also drilled
    an exploration well on BM-ES-30, which was expensed.

•

The Corporation successfully flow tested the discovery well in
    exploration Area 54 (Hess 100%) offshore Libya and subsequently
    drilled and successfully flow tested a down-dip appraisal well
    on the block. In 2010, the Corporation plans to reprocess 3D
    seismic, integrating acquired well information and will continue
    technical and commercial evaluation of the block.

•

The Corporation acquired rights to explore a total of more than
    80,000 net acres in the Marcellus gas shale formation in
    Pennsylvania. The Corporation is operator and holds a 100%
    interest on approximately 50,000 acres and holds a 50%
    non-operated interest in the remaining acreage. Exploration
    drilling activity is expected to commence in 2010.

Marketing
    and Refining

The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to
    deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash
    flow. M&R net income was $127 million in 2009,
    $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. The
    declining earnings were due to lower average margins, which
    include the effect of the global economic downturn that began in
    2008 and continued into 2009.  Refining operations contributed
    net income (loss) of $(87) million in 2009,
    $73 million in 2008 and $193 million in 2007.
    Marketing earnings were $168 million in 2009,
    $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007.

Liquidity
    and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $3,046 million in 2009, $4,688 million in 2008 and
    $3,627 million in 2007, principally reflecting fluctuations
    in earnings. At December 31, 2009, cash and cash
    equivalents totaled $1,362 million compared with
    $908 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt was
    $4,467 million at December 31, 2009 compared with
    $3,955 million at December 31, 2008. In February 2009,
    the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior
    unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of
    10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The
    majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the
    revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other
    credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued
    $750 million of 30 year bonds at a coupon of 6% and
    tendered for $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The
    Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of the
    2011 bonds in December 2009 and repurchased the remaining
    $116 million of these bonds in January 2010. The
    Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at
    December 31, 2009 was 24.8% compared with 24.2% at the end
    of 2008.

Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the
    years ended December 31:

In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
    transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
    reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
    after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
    earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
    preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
    they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
    the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
    the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

Amounts differ from E&P
    operating revenues in Note 16, Segment Information,
    primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons
    purchased from third parties.



After considering the E&P items in the table on
    page 23, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are
    primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production
    volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign
    exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below.

Selling prices:

Lower average selling
    prices reduced E&P revenues by approximately
    $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Higher average
    selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately
    $2,100 million in 2008 compared with 2007.

The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows:

In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil
    hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though
    2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same
    counterparty. The deferred after-tax loss as of the date the
    hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the
    contracts mature. The estimated annual after-tax loss from the
    closed positions will be approximately $335 million from
    2010 through 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by
    $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in
    2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced E&P earnings
    by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in
    2008 and $244 million ($399 million before income
    taxes) in 2007.

Production and sales volumes:

The
    Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was
    408,000 boepd in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and
    377,000 boepd in 2007. The Corporation currently estimates that
    its 2010 production will average between 400,000 and 410,000
    boepd.

    converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf
    equals one barrel).

United States:

Crude oil and natural
    gas production in the United States was higher in 2009 compared
    with 2008, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi Field
    and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes. Crude oil
    production was slightly higher in 2008 compared with 2007,
    principally due to production from new wells in North Dakota and
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, largely offset by the impact of
    hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas production was
    lower in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily reflecting hurricane
    downtime and natural decline. Hurricane impacts reduced full
    year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd.

Europe:

Crude oil production was
    comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher production in Russia
    offset lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea. Crude
    oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007, due to temporary
    shut-ins at three North Sea fields, the cessation of production
    at the Fife, Fergus, Flora and Angus fields, and natural
    decline. These decreases were partially offset by increased
    production in Russia. Natural gas production was lower in 2009
    compared with 2008, primarily due to decline at the Atlantic and
    Cromarty fields.

Africa:

Crude oil production decreased
    in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower production
    from the Ceiba Field. Crude oil production increased in 2008
    compared with 2007, primarily due to higher production at the
    Okume Complex, partially offset by a lower entitlement to
    Algerian production.

Asia and other:

Natural gas production
    in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a full year of
    Phase 2 gas sales from the Joint Development Area of
    Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas production increased in
    2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from Block

A-18

in the
    JDA and a full year of production from the Ujung Pangkah Field
    in Indonesia. The decrease in crude oil production in 2008 from
    2007 principally reflects changes to the Corporation’s
    entitlement to production in Azerbaijan.

Sales volumes:

Higher sales volumes and
    other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately
    $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008 and
    $200 million in 2008 compared with 2007.

Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and
    amortization:

Excluding the impact of items affecting
    comparability explained on page 23, cash operating costs,
    consisting of production expenses and general and administrative
    expenses, decreased by $119 million in 2009 and increased
    by $321 million in 2008 compared with the corresponding
    amounts in the prior years. The decrease in 2009 compared with
    2008 was primarily due to lower



production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices), the
    cessation of production at several North Sea fields, the
    favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings
    initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher production
    volumes. The increase in costs in 2008 compared to 2007 was
    primarily due to increased production taxes (due to higher
    realized selling prices), increased cost of services and
    materials and higher employee costs.

Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability,
    depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by
    $192 million in 2009 and $531 million in 2008,
    compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years. The
    increases in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to higher
    production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher
    finding and development costs.

Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, unit
    costs were as follows. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil
    equivalent were $13.70 in 2009, $15.49 in 2008 and $13.36 in
    2007. Cash operating costs in 2010 are estimated to be in the
    range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation,
    depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent
    were $14.19 in 2009, $13.79 in 2008 and $10.11 in 2007.
    Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2010 are
    estimated to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of
    oil equivalent.

Exploration expenses:

Exploration
    expenses increased in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to higher
    dry hole costs and lease amortization, partially offset by lower
    geological and seismic expense. Exploration expenses increased
    in 2008 compared to 2007, mainly due to higher dry hole costs.

Income taxes:

Excluding the impact of
    items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates
    for E&P operations were 48% in 2009, 49% in 2008 and 50% in
    2007. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in
    2010 is estimated to be in the range of 47% to 51%.

Foreign Exchange:

The after-tax foreign
    currency losses were $10 million in 2009, $80 million
    in 2008 and $7 million in 2007. The foreign currency loss
    in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate
    movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of
    assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by
    certain foreign businesses.

Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting
    comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes:

2009:

In October 2009, the U.S. Supreme
    Court decided it would not review the decision of the
    5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals
    Management Service relating to royalty relief under the Deep
    Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation
    recognized an after-tax gain of $89 million to reverse all
    previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to
    2009. The pre-tax gain of $143 million is reported in
    Other, net within the Statement of Consolidated Income.

After-tax charges of $44 million ($77 million before
    income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of
    production equipment and two short-lived fields in the United
    Kingdom North Sea, and to write down materials inventories in
    Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre-tax amount of
    the impairment charges totaling $52 million were reported
    in Depreciation, depletion and amortization and the majority of
    the $25 million in inventory write downs was reported in
    Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.



2008:

The charge for asset impairments relates
    to mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom
    North Sea. The hurricane costs relate to expenses associated
    with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico and are
    recorded in Production expenses.

2007:

The gain from asset sales relates to the
    sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and
    Telford fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for
    asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the
    United Kingdom North Sea. The estimated production imbalance
    settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter
    readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a
    reduction of Sales and other operating revenues.

The Corporation’s future E&P earnings may be impacted
    by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of
    crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes,
    political risk, industry costs, exploration expenses, the
    effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income
    tax rates.

Marketing
    and Refining

Earnings from M&R activities amounted to $127 million
    in 2009, $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in
    2007. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in
    the table on page 20 and discussed below, the earnings were
    $115 million, $277 million and $276 million,
    respectively.

Refining:

Refining earnings (losses),
    which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
    results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note
    receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous
    operating activities, were $(87) million in 2009 (including
    a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment),
    $73 million in 2008, and $193 million in 2007.

The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a
    loss of $141 million ($229 million before income
    taxes) in 2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million
    before income taxes) in 2008 and $108 million
    ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007. The declining
    earnings were principally due to lower refining margins. The
    2009 and 2008 utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker
    refining margins and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008
    utilization rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for
    Hurricane Omar. In 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown
    for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround.
    Certain related processing units were also included in this
    turnaround. In January 2010, HOVENSA commenced a turnaround of
    its FCC unit which is expected to take approximately
    40 days. The Corporation’s estimated share of
    HOVENSA’s turnaround expenses after income taxes is
    expected to be approximately $20 million.

Cash distributions received by the Corporation from HOVENSA were
    $50 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. In 2009,
    the remaining balance on the note issued by PDVSA at inception
    of the joint venture was fully repaid.

Other after-tax refining earnings, principally from Port Reading
    operations, were $43 million in both 2009 and 2008 and
    $79 million in 2007, reflecting lower margins. The
    Corporation is planning a turnaround for the Port Reading
    refining facility in the second quarter of 2010, which is
    expected to take approximately 35 days. The estimated
    after-tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround are
    approximately $25 million.

Marketing:

Marketing operations, which
    consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing
    activities, generated income of $168 million in 2009,
    $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007,
    including income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in
    2007 totaling $24 million ($38 million before income
    taxes).



The decrease in earnings in 2009 compared with 2008 reflects
    lower margins in a weak economic environment. The increase in
    2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects higher margins on
    refined product sales, including sales of retail gasoline
    operations.

The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
    partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
    derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
    its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
    trading activities, including its share of the results of the
    trading partnership, amounted to earnings of $46 million in
    2009, a loss of $36 million in 2008 and earnings of
    $24 million in 2007.

Marketing expenses decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008,
    principally reflecting lower retail credit card fees. Marketing
    expenses increased in 2008 compared with 2007, due to growth in
    energy marketing activities, higher retail credit card fees, and
    increased transportation costs.

The Corporation’s future M&R earnings may be impacted
    by external factors, such as volatility in margins, competitive
    industry conditions, government regulations, credit risk, and
    supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather.

Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the
    decrease in corporate expenses in 2009 compared with 2008
    primarily reflects gains on supplemental pension related
    investments, together with lower employee and professional
    costs, partly offset by higher bank facility fees. The increase
    in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily
    reflects losses on supplemental pension related investments and
    higher employee and professional costs. After-tax corporate
    expenses in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $160 to
    $170 million.

In 2009, the Corporation recorded after-tax charges of
    $34 million ($54 million before income taxes) related
    to the repurchase of $546 million in notes that were
    scheduled to mature in 2011 and $26 million
    ($42 million before income taxes) relating to retirement
    benefits and employee severance costs. The pre-tax charge in
    connection with the debt repurchase was recorded in Other, net,
    and the pre-tax amount of the retirement benefits and severance
    costs was recorded in General and administrative expenses within
    the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2007, Corporate
    expenses included a charge of $25 million ($40 million
    before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre-tax
    amount of this charge was recorded in General and administrative
    expenses.

The increase in interest expense primarily reflects higher debt
    and fees for letters of credit. The decrease in capitalized
    interest in 2009 and 2008 compared to 2007 reflects the
    completion of several development projects in 2007. After-tax
    interest expense in 2010 is expected to be in the range of $220
    to $230 million.

Sales
    and Other Operating Revenues

Sales and other operating revenues totaled $29,614 million
    in 2009, a decrease of 28% compared with 2008. In 2008, sales
    and other operating revenues totaled $41,134 million, an
    increase of 30% compared with 2007. The fluctuations in each
    year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined product
    selling prices.

The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally
    reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined
    products and purchased natural gas and electricity.

    for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which
    are adjacent to Block

A-18

of the
    JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for
    leasehold acquisitions in the United States and
    $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5%
    interest in the Corporation’s Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008,
    the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing
    business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity
    customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an
    aggregate of approximately $100 million. In 2007, capital
    expenditures include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the
    Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for
    $371 million.

In 2007, the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million
    for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields
    located in the United Kingdom.

Financing Activities:

During 2009, net
    proceeds from borrowings were $447 million. In February
    2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year
    senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion
    of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%.
    The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the
    revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other
    credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued
    $750 million of 30 year bonds with a coupon of 6% and
    tendered for the $662 million of bonds due in August 2011.
    The Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of
    the 2011 bonds in December 2009. The remaining $116 million
    of 2011 bonds, classified as Current maturities of long term
    debt at December 31, 2009, was redeemed in January 2010,
    resulting in a charge of approximately $11 million
    ($7 million after income taxes). During 2008, net
    repayments of debt were $32 million, compared with net
    borrowings of $208 million in 2007.

Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million,
    $130 million and $127 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The Corporation received net proceeds from the
    exercise of stock options, including related income tax
    benefits, of $18 million, $340 million and
    $111 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Future
    Capital Requirements and Resources

The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately
    $4.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during
    2010, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P
    operations. In the Corporation’s M&R operations,
    refining margins are currently weak, which have adversely
    affected HOVENSA’s liquidity position. The Corporation
    intends to provide its share of any necessary financial support
    for HOVENSA. The Corporation expects to fund its 2010
    operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension
    contributions and required debt repayments and any necessary
    financial support for HOVENSA, with existing cash on-hand, cash
    flow from operations and its available credit facilities. Crude
    oil prices, natural gas prices and refining margins are volatile
    and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in
    the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur.
    If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in
    commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital
    expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its
    financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity,
    including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of
    equity securities,

and/or

asset
    sales.

The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated,
    revolving credit facility (the facility), of which
    $2,925 million is committed through May 2012. The facility
    can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2009, available capacity under the facility
    was $3.0 billion. The Corporation has a 364 day
    asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts
    receivable from its M&R operations. At December 31,
    2009, under the terms of this financing arrangement, the
    Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit
    of up to $1.0 billion, subject to the availability of
    sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31,
    2009, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were
    collateralized by a total of $1,326 million of accounts
    receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These
    receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of
    the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding
    obligations under the asset backed facility.

The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may
    issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
    preferred stock.

A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporation’s debt
    to capitalization ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to
    an additional $18.1 billion for the construction or
    acquisition of assets at December 31, 2009. The Corporation
    has the ability to borrow up to an additional $3.7 billion
    of secured debt at December 31, 2009 under the loan
    agreement covenants.

The Corporation’s $2,847 million in letters of credit
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 were primarily issued to
    satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 14, Risk
    Management and Trading Activities.

Credit
    Ratings

There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the
    Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently
    assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporation’s
    debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of
    the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin
    requirements from risk management and trading counterparties,
    are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit
    rating changes.

The Corporation intends to
    continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA.
    Estimated future purchases amount to approximately
    $6.0 billion annually using year-end 2009 prices, which
    have been included in the table through 2014.

In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
    commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
    HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
    sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future
    supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market
    prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA,
    and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included
    are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional
    gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail
    marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
    facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to
    purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply
    contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These
    commitments were computed based predominately on year-end market
    prices.

The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including
    the portion of the Corporation’s planned $4.1 billion
    capital investment program for 2010 that is contractually
    committed at December 31, 2009. Obligations for operating
    expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic
    purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal
    business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect
    contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2009, including asset retirement obligations,
    pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for
    uncertain income tax positions.

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline
    stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets
    for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating
    leases. The Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new
    drillship and related support services for use in its global
    deepwater exploration and development activities. The total
    payments under this five year contract are expected to be
    approximately $950 million. The Corporation took delivery
    of the drillship in the fourth quarter of 2009.

The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring
    in April 2012, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a
    retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately
    $184 million as of December 31, 2009.

The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
    HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other
    than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee
    fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and
    related prices and at December 31, 2009 it amounted to
    $121 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to
    provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the
    extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt
    obligations.



The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit
    and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly
    related to its business at December 31, 2009 as shown below:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance
    sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
    Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is
    $412 million at December 31, 2009 compared with
    $491 million at December 31, 2008. The
    Corporation’s December 31, 2009 debt to capitalization
    ratio would increase from 24.8% to 26.5% if these leases were
    included as debt.

See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 15,
    Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial
    statements.

Foreign
    Operations

The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities
    outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia,
    Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea,
    Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia,
    Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is
    subject to the risks associated with foreign operations,
    including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk.

Accounting
    Policies

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
    assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
    accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and
    various financial statement ratios. However, the
    Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change
    cash flows or liquidity.

Accounting for Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
    after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
    producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if
    there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational
    viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged
    to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing
    reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project
    include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations
    for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with
    governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for
    additional drilling and other factors.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves:

The
    SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure
    requirements effective for year-end 2009 reporting. In addition,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its
    accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and
    disclosures. The determination of estimated



proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the
    results of operations of exploration and production activities.
    The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations,
    the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties
    and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil
    and gas assets and goodwill.

For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with
    reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known
    reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods
    and government regulations. In addition, government and project
    operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount
    of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors
    must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its
    own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical
    staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The
    Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates
    throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells,
    performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To
    provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve
    estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and
    approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are
    subject to internal technical audits and senior management
    review. The Corporation also engaged an independent third party
    consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the
    Corporation’s total proved reserves.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
    Goodwill:

As explained below there are
    significant differences in the way long-lived assets and
    goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas
    fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable
    cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
    other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the
    long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by
    undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are
    impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
    impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
    generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash
    flows.

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
    net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
    future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
    historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
    projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted
    rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves,
    including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a
    stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production
    volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with
    internal projections and other externally reported information.
    Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will
    generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of
    discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure
    requires the use of historical twelve month average prices.

The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P
    producing assets are based on its best estimates of future
    production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices,
    operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and
    other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is
    performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the
    projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease,
    crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly
    for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating
    costs increase significantly.

The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment at a
    reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level
    below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted
    annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill
    may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to
    evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined
    primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The
    Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the E&P
    operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill
    will be recovered through the operation of that segment.

The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the E&P
    segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash
    flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the
    estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and
    (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price
    an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost
    savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise
    control, improved processes and increased market share. The
    Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of
    similar Exploration and Production companies.



The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment
    depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices,
    timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant
    extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced
    reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of
    the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of
    goodwill.

As there are significant differences in the way long-lived
    assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
    testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
    would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the
    E&P segment.

Income Taxes:

Judgments are required in
    the determination and recognition of income tax assets and
    liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include
    the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect
    of a tax position when management believes that it is more
    likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the
    position will be sustained upon examination.

The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit
    carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United
    States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses
    and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax
    assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and
    tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments
    are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being
    realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
    is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that
    is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of
    deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal
    periods for temporary differences, available carryforward
    periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards,
    estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax
    planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and
    other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on
    assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are
    consistent with the Corporation’s internal business
    forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which
    have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in
    consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and
    equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The
    amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany
    transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through
    depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these
    assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed
    earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely
    reinvested in foreign operations.

Fair Value Measurements:

The
    Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental
    pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with
    changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other
    comprehensive income each period. The Corporation uses various
    valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the
    market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value
    measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of
    money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for
    receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is
    considered for accrued liabilities.

The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the
    FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which
    established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs,
    which generally range from quoted prices for identical
    instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to
    estimates determined using related market data (Level 3).
    Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the
    level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input
    level within this fair value hierarchy. Inputs include
    discounted cash flow calculations and other unobservable data.

The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. These fair value measurements include
    assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business
    combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement
    obligations and long-lived assets and goodwill measured at fair
    value in an impairment assessment.

Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the
    fair values are as follows

:

Fair value measurements based on Level 1
    inputs:

Measurements that are most observable
    are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained
    from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing
    prices are both readily available and representative of fair
    value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and
    volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the
    Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are
    considered Level 1.



Fair value measurements based on Level 2
    inputs:

Measurements derived indirectly from
    observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are
    less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on
    Level 2 inputs include

over-the-counter

derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded
    curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to
    exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value
    measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards,
    swaps and options. The liability related to the
    Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as
    Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3
    inputs:

Measurements that are least
    observable are estimated from related market data determined
    from sources with little or no market activity for comparable
    contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example,
    in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural
    gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure
    by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales
    and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid
    delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair
    values determined using discounted cash flows are also
    classified as Level 3.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both risk management and trading
    activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the
    prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
    electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency
    exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation,
    principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy
    commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards,
    options and swaps, based on expectations of future market
    conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are
    recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated
    as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted
    transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments
    (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair
    value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is
    recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).
    Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in
    the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
    The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in
    earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The
    change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is
    recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized
    currently in earnings.

Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair
    value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before
    they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on
    an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify
    for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective
    effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical
    simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical
    observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot
    prices.

Retirement Plans:

The Corporation has
    funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an
    unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes
    on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the
    projected benefit obligation for these plans.

The determination of the obligations and expenses related to
    these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most
    significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring
    the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term
    rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in
    compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made
    by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external
    factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the
    Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a
    portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with
    maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan
    obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is
    developed from the expected future returns for each asset
    category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to
    that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a
    material impact on the amounts reported in the
    Corporation’s financial statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with



generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation
    recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset
    retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any
    legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is
    recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
    Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the
    carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which
    the liability is incurred. In order to measure these
    obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the
    obligations by discounting the future payments that will be
    required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these
    estimates, the Corporation is required to make several
    assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement,
    timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements,
    inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are
    other external factors which could significantly affect the
    ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including:
    changes in environmental regulations and other statutory
    requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign
    currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a
    result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement
    obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described
    above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in
    adjustments to both the liability and related asset values.

Changes
    in Accounting Policies

The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became
    effective on July 1, 2009. The ASC combined multiple
    sources of authoritative accounting literature into a single
    source of authoritative GAAP organized by accounting topic.
    Since the ASC was not intended to change existing GAAP, the only
    impact on the Corporation’s financial statements was that
    specific references to accounting principles have been changed
    to refer to the ASC.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB
    accounting standard for the accounting for and reporting of
    noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary (ASC
    810 — Consolidation, originally issued as
    FAS 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
    Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

). As
    required, the Corporation retrospectively applied the
    presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard. At
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 noncontrolling
    interests of $144 million and $84 million,
    respectively, have been classified as a component of equity.
    Prior to adoption, noncontrolling interests were classified in
    Other liabilities. Net income (loss) attributable to the
    noncontrolling interests must also be separately reported in the
    Statement of Consolidated Income. Certain other amounts in the
    consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been
    reclassified to conform with the presentation requirements of
    this standard.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB
    accounting standard that expanded the qualitative, quantitative
    and credit risk disclosure requirements related to an
    entity’s use of derivative instruments (ASC 815 —
    Derivatives and Hedging, originally issued as FAS 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

). See Note 14, Risk Management and Trading
    Activities, for these disclosures.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation also adopted the
    FASB staff position that requires the application of the fair
    value measurement and disclosure provisions to nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis (ASC 820 — Fair Value Measurements
    and Disclosures, originally issued as FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

). Such fair
    value measurements are determined based on the same fair value
    hierarchy of inputs required to measure the fair value of
    financial assets and liabilities. The impact of this accounting
    standard was not material to the Corporation’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective June 30, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB
    accounting standard which provides guidance on the accounting
    for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet
    date but before financial statements are issued (ASC
    855 — Subsequent Events, originally issued as
    FAS 165,

Subsequent Events

). The adoption of this
    standard did not impact the Corporation’s existing practice
    of evaluating subsequent events through the date the financial
    statements are issued.

In January 2010, the FASB adopted an accounting standards update
    (ASU) Extractive Activities — Oil and Gas (ASC
    932 — Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures)
    which is effective for financial statements for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and amends the requirements for oil and
    gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The objective of the ASU
    was to align accounting standards with the previously issued SEC
    requirements on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure.
    The main provisions of the ASU are to expand the definition of
    oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of
    resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change
    the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash
    flows to a twelve month average from the year-end



price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for
    reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See
    the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2009, the FASB amended existing accounting standards to
    eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity
    (ASC 860 — Transfers and Servicing, originally issued
    as FAS 166,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140

), which did not require consolidation under
    existing GAAP. The FASB also amended existing accounting
    standards to limit the circumstances in which transferred
    financial assets should be derecognized (ASC 810 —
    Consolidation, originally issued as FAS 167,

Amendments
    to FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46(R)

). The amended
    standards require additional analysis of variable interest
    entities to determine if consolidation is necessary. The
    adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on
    the Corporation’s financial statements. As required, the
    Corporation will adopt the provisions of these standards
    effective January 1, 2010.

Environment,
    Health and Safety

The Corporation has a values-based, socially-responsible
    strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety
    performance and making a positive impact on communities where it
    does business. The strategy is reflected in the
    Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social
    responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment
    and safety management systems that help protect the
    Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities.
    The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold
    or exceed international standards and are intended to promote
    internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and
    continual improvement in EHS & SR performance.
    Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the
    Corporation’s operating costs and could also require
    increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to
    assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to
    enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity
    and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral
    benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation
    has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit
    facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and
    emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR
    goals.

The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation
    distributes fuel oils in the United States. Proposals by state
    regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would
    require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils. If adopted, these
    proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation
    and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards.

As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the
    Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA
    regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI).
    The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain
    air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA
    has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with
    petroleum refining companies that control over 90% of the
    domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are
    continuing and substantial progress has been made toward
    resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA.
    While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining
    Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is
    reached and entered by a court, additional significant future
    capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be
    incurred by HOVENSA over a number of years. The amount of
    penalties, if any, is not expected to be material.

The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and
    reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon
    dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate
    change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is
    committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas
    emissions from our existing assets and future developments and
    is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions.

The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for
    environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective
    action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals,
    onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries
    (including solid waste management units under permits issued
    pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and,
    although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites
    where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible
    party.



The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
    remediation expenditures for known sites when the future costs
    are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2009, the
    Corporation’s reserve for estimated environmental
    liabilities was approximately $55 million. The
    Corporation’s environmental assessment and remediation
    expenditures were approximately $11 million in each of the
    years 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Corporation expects that existing
    reserves for environmental liabilities are sufficient for costs
    to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation anticipates
    capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with
    federal, state and local environmental standards, of
    approximately $50 million in 2010.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
    to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
    natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
    changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. The
    Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a
    50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades
    energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are
    also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices
    of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following
    describes how these risks are controlled and managed.

Controls:

The Corporation maintains a
    control environment under the direction of its chief risk
    officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the
    Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls
    include volumetric, term and

value-at-risk

limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new
    instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and
    reported on daily to business units and to senior management.
    The Corporation’s risk management department also performs
    independent verifications of sources of fair values and
    validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of
    the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities,
    including the consolidated trading partnership. The
    Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for
    administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging
    programs.

The Corporation uses

value-at-risk

to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and
    risk management activities. The

value-at-risk

model uses historical simulation and the results represent the
    potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence
    level. The model captures both first and second order
    sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as
    strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change
    in risk management activities.

Instruments:

The Corporation primarily
    uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward
    contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based
    securities in its risk management and trading activities. These
    contracts are generally widely traded instruments with
    standardized terms. The following describes these instruments
    and how the Corporation uses them:

•

Forward Commodity Contracts:

The Corporation
    enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of
    commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the
    contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity.
    Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale
    contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk
    disclosures.

•

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:

The
    Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the
    British pound, the Euro, and the Thai Baht, which commit the
    Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at
    a predetermined exchange rate on a future date.



•

Exchange Traded Contracts:

The Corporation
    uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number
    of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are
    settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to
    exchange position limits.

•

Swaps:

The Corporation uses financially
    settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging
    and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are
    determined based on underlying commodity prices and are
    typically settled over the life of the contract.

•

Options:

Options on various underlying energy
    commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts
    and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the
    Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk
    of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying
    the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a
    premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the
    favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These
    premiums are a component of the fair value of the options.

•

Energy Securities:

Energy securities include
    energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or
    government or related derivatives on these securities.

Risk
    Management Activities

Energy marketing activities:

In its
    energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to
    commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating
    prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as
    futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical
    assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce
    margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with
    customers.

Corporate risk management:

Corporate
    risk management activities include transactions designed to
    reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas
    produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign
    currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps
    or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling
    price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or
    natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to
    purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does
    business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign
    currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used,
    generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating.

The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
    exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
    formal contracts for various currencies including the British
    pound, the Euro and the Thai baht. At December 31, 2009 the
    Corporation had a payable of $16 million related to foreign
    exchange contracts maturing in 2010. The fair value of the
    foreign exchange contracts was also a payable of
    $16 million at December 31, 2009. The change in fair
    value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20% strengthening
    of the US dollar exchange rate is estimated to be approximately
    $172 million at December 31, 2009.

The Corporation’s debt of $4,467 million has a fair
    value of $5,073 million at December 31, 2009. A 15%
    decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value
    of debt by approximately $120 million at December 31,
    2009.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
    as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
    on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness
    of the Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in their
    report, which is included herein.

Report of

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009 based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and
    equity and comprehensive income of Hess Corporation and
    consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated
    February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Hess Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the
    “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows,
    and equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also
    included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Hess Corporation and consolidated
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Corporation adopted new oil and gas reserve
    estimation and disclosure requirements effective
    December 31, 2009. Also, as discussed in Note 1 to the
    consolidated financial statements, the Corporation adopted the
    guidance originally issued in Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Financial Accounting Standard 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(codified in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic
    810,

Consolidation

), effective January 1, 2009.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hess
    Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business:

Hess Corporation
    and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) engage in the exploration
    for and the development, production, purchase, transportation
    and sale of crude oil and natural gas. These activities are
    conducted principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil,
    Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana,
    Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, the
    United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, the
    Corporation manufactures, purchases, transports, markets and
    trades, refined petroleum and other energy products. The
    Corporation owns 50% of HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a refinery
    joint venture in the United States Virgin Islands. An additional
    refining facility, terminals and retail gasoline stations, most
    of which include convenience stores, are located on the East
    Coast of the United States.

In preparing financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
    management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
    and revenues and expenses in the income statement. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Among the estimates
    made by management are oil and gas reserves, asset valuations,
    depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental
    obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. In
    the preparation of these financial statements, the Corporation
    has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial
    statements are issued.

Principles of Consolidation:

The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess
    Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
    a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
    The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
    and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
    consolidated.

Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned, including
    HOVENSA, are stated at cost of acquisition plus the
    Corporation’s equity in undistributed net income since
    acquisition. The Corporation consolidates the trading
    partnership in which it owns a 50% voting interest and over
    which it exercises control.

Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
    consolidation.

Revenue Recognition:

The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas,
    petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to
    the customer. Sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes
    in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation
    recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas
    properties based on sales to customers. Differences between
    E&P natural gas volumes sold and the Corporation’s
    share of natural gas production are not material. Revenues from
    natural gas and electricity sales by the Corporation’s
    marketing operations are recognized based on meter readings and
    estimated deliveries to customers since the last meter reading.

In its exploration and production activities, the Corporation
    enters into crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the
    same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one
    another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality.
    Similarly, in its marketing activities, the Corporation enters
    into refined product purchase and sale transactions with the
    same counterparty. These arrangements are reported net in Sales
    and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated
    Income.

Derivatives:

The Corporation utilizes
    derivative instruments for both risk management and trading
    activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses
    futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in
    combination, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices
    of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as
    well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
    In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a
    consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives,
    including futures, forwards, options and swaps based on
    expectations of future market conditions.

All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the
    Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy
    for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies
    based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash
    flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of
    firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of
    changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash
    flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive
    income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are
    reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged
    item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of
    changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow
    hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value
    of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized
    currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related
    hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying
    amount and recognized currently in earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
    equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are
    readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three
    months or less when acquired.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at
    the lower of cost or market. For refined product inventories
    valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) inventory method. For the remaining
    inventories, cost is generally determined using average actual
    costs.

Exploration and Development
    Costs:

Exploration and production activities
    are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of
    acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage,
    including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related
    costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration
    expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as
    incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells,
    including development dry holes, and related production
    facilities are capitalized.

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
    are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
    have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized
    after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a
    sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
    producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if
    there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational
    viability of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged
    to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing
    reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project
    include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for
    sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments,
    operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling
    and other factors.

Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization:

The Corporation records
    depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties
    using the units of production method over proved oil and gas
    reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas
    production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of
    production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves.
    Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are
    based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of
    all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line
    method based on estimated useful lives. Retail gas stations and
    equipment related to a leased property, are depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives not to exceed the remaining lease period.
    The Corporation records the cost of acquired customers in its
    energy marketing activities as intangible assets and amortizes
    these costs on the straight-line method over the expected
    renewal period based on historical experience.

Capitalized Interest:

Interest from
    external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using
    the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the
    project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
    use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from
    the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful
    lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of
    the underlying assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The
    Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and
    dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at
    certain exploration and production locations. The Corporation
    recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required
    asset retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets
    in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred.
    In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional
    asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be
    reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes the associated
    asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the
    long-lived assets.



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The
    Corporation reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts are not
    expected to be recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the
    assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The
    amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the
    assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future
    net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the net
    present value of future cash flows is based on management’s
    best estimate of future prices, which is determined with
    reference to recent historical prices and published forward
    prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted
    at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes
    represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be
    produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.
    The production volumes, prices and timing of production are
    consistent with internal projections and other externally
    reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining
    asset impairments will generally differ from the average prices
    used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
    flows.

Impairment of Equity Investees:

The
    Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    other than temporary decline in value has occurred. The amount
    of the impairment is based on quoted market prices, where
    available, or other valuation techniques.

Impairment of Goodwill:

Goodwill is
    tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. This impairment
    test is calculated at the reporting unit level, which for the
    Corporation’s goodwill is the Exploration and Production
    operating segment. The Corporation identifies potential
    impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to
    its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not
    impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the
    Corporation calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing
    the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If
    the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying
    amount, an impairment would be recorded.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are
    determined using the liability method. The Corporation regularly
    assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on
    estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax
    planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the
    available carryforward periods for net operating losses and
    other factors. If it is more likely than not that some or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation
    allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the
    amount expected to be realized. In addition, the Corporation
    recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only
    when management believes that it is more likely than not, that
    based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained
    upon examination. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes
    which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated
    in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and
    equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The
    amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany
    transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through
    depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these
    assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred
    U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed
    earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely
    reinvested in foreign operations. The Corporation classifies
    interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions
    as income tax expense.

Fair Value Measurements:

The
    Corporation adopted a new accounting standard for fair value
    measurements, effective January 1, 2008 (ASC
    820 — Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
    originally issued as FAS 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

). The standard establishes a hierarchy for the
    inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the
    input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical
    instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to
    estimates determined using related market data (Level 3).
    Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the
    level of fair value for each financial asset or liability is
    based on the lowest significant input level within this fair
    value hierarchy.

Fair value measurements based on Level 1
    inputs:

Measurements that are most observable
    are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained
    from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing
    prices are both readily available and representative of fair
    value. Market transactions occur with sufficient



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of
    certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and
    options are considered Level 1.

Fair value measurements based on Level 2
    inputs:

Measurements derived indirectly from
    observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are
    less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on
    Level 2 inputs include

over-the-counter

derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded
    curve, but have contractual terms that are not identical to
    exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value
    measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards,
    swaps and options. The liability related to the
    Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as
    Level 2.

Fair value measurements based on Level 3
    inputs:

Measurements that are least
    observable are estimated from related market data, determined
    from sources with little or no market activity for comparable
    contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example,
    in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural
    gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure
    by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales
    and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid
    delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. There
    may be offsets to these positions that are priced based on more
    liquid markets, which are, therefore, classified as Level 1
    or Level 2.

The impact of adopting the fair value measurements standard was
    not material to the Corporation’s results of operations.
    Upon adoption in 2008, the Corporation recorded a reduction in
    the net deferred hedge losses reflected in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which increased equity by
    $193 million, after income taxes.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Corporation applied the
    provisions of a new accounting standard for the accounting for
    liabilities measured at fair value with a third-party credit
    enhancement (ASC 820 — Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures, originally issued as Emerging Issues Task Force

08-5,

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair
    Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement

). Upon adoption,
    the Corporation revalued certain derivative liabilities
    collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the
    Corporation’s credit rating rather than the credit rating
    of the issuing bank. The adoption resulted in an increase in
    Sales and other operating revenues of approximately
    $13 million and an increase in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income of approximately $78 million, with a
    corresponding decrease in derivative liabilities recorded within
    Accounts payable.

Retirement Plans:

The Corporation
    recognizes the underfunded status of defined benefit
    postretirement plans on the balance sheet. For the
    Corporation’s pension plans, the underfunded status is
    measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
    and the projected benefit obligation. The Corporation recognizes
    the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year
    in which such changes occur.

Share-Based Compensation:

The fair
    value of all share-based compensation is expensed and recognized
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The
    U.S. dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in
    which business is conducted) for most foreign operations.
    Adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and
    liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency
    into the functional currency are recorded in Other, net within
    Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of
    Consolidated Income. For operations that do not use the
    U.S. dollar as the functional currency, adjustments
    resulting from translating foreign currency assets and
    liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded in a separate
    component of equity titled Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss).

Maintenance and Repairs:

Maintenance
    and repairs are expensed as incurred, including costs of
    refinery turnarounds. Capital improvements are recorded as
    additions in Property, plant and equipment.

Environmental Expenditures:

The
    Corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs to
    remediate existing conditions related to past operations when
    the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. The

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase
    the life or efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent
    future adverse impacts to the environment.

Changes in Accounting Policies:

The
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards
    Codification (ASC) became effective on July 1, 2009. The
    ASC combined multiple sources of authoritative accounting
    literature into a single source of authoritative GAAP organized
    by accounting topic. Since the ASC was not intended to change
    existing GAAP, the only impact on the Corporation’s
    financial statements was that specific references to accounting
    principles have been changed to refer to the ASC.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB
    accounting standard for the accounting for and reporting of
    noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary (ASC
    810 — Consolidation, originally issued as
    FAS 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
    Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

). As
    required, the Corporation retrospectively applied the
    presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard. At
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
    noncontrolling interests of $144 million and
    $84 million, respectively, have been classified as a
    component of equity. Prior to adoption, noncontrolling interests
    were classified in Other liabilities. Net income (loss)
    attributable to the noncontrolling interests must also be
    separately reported in the Statement of Consolidated Income.
    Certain other amounts in the consolidated financial statements
    and footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the
    presentation requirements of this standard.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB
    accounting standard that expanded the qualitative, quantitative
    and credit risk disclosure requirements related to an
    entity’s use of derivative instruments (ASC 815 —
    Derivatives and Hedging, originally issued as FAS 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

). See Note 14, Risk Management and Trading
    Activities, for these disclosures.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation also adopted the
    FASB staff position that requires the application of the fair
    value measurement and disclosure provisions to nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis (ASC 820 — Fair Value Measurements
    and Disclosures, originally issued as FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

). Such fair
    value measurements are determined based on the same fair value
    hierarchy of inputs required to measure the fair value of
    financial assets and liabilities. The impact of this accounting
    standard was not material to the Corporation’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective June 30, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB
    accounting standard which provides guidance on the accounting
    for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet
    date but before financial statements are issued (ASC
    855 — Subsequent Events, originally issued as
    FAS 165,

Subsequent Events

). The adoption of this
    standard did not impact the Corporation’s existing practice
    of evaluating subsequent events through the date the financial
    statements are issued.

In January 2010, the FASB adopted an accounting standards update
    (ASU) Extractive Activities — Oil and Gas (ASC
    932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures, which
    is effective for year-end 2009 reporting and amends the
    requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures.
    The objective of the ASU was to align accounting standards with
    the previously issued Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    requirements on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure.
    The main provisions of the ASU are to expand the definition of
    oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of
    resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change
    the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash
    flows to a twelve month average from the year-end price and to
    amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting
    reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See the
    Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures.

Recently Issued Accounting
    Standards:

In June 2009, the FASB amended
    existing accounting standards to eliminate the concept of a
    qualifying special-purpose entity (ASC 860 — Transfers
    and Servicing, originally issued as FAS 166,

Accounting
    for Transfers of Financial Assets — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 140

), which did not require
    consolidation under existing GAAP. The FASB also amended
    existing standards to limit the circumstances in which
    transferred financial assets should be derecognized (and ASC
    810 — Consolidation, originally issued as
    FAS 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation
    No. FIN 46(R)).

The amended standards require

additional analysis of variable interest entities to determine
    if consolidation is necessary. The adoption of these standards
    will not have a material impact on the Corporation’s
    financial statements. As required, the Corporation will adopt
    the provisions of these standards effective January 1, 2010.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

2009:

The Corporation acquired for
    $74 million a 50% interest in Blocks PM301 and PM302 in
    Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block

A-18

of the
    Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA) and contain an
    extension of the Bumi Field. The Corporation also acquired 37
    previously leased retail gasoline stations, primarily through
    the assumption of $65 million of fixed rate notes.

2008:

The Corporation acquired the
    remaining 22.5% interest in its Gabonese subsidiary for
    $285 million, of which $210 million was allocated to
    proved properties. The Corporation expanded its energy marketing
    business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity
    customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an
    aggregate of approximately $100 million.

2007:

The Corporation completed the
    acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas
    development located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green
    Canyon Blocks 652 and 608 for $371 million, of which
    $342 million was allocated to proved and unproved
    properties and the remainder to wells and equipment. This
    transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Genghis
    Khan has been unitized with the Shenzi development.

The Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Scott
    and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom North Sea for
    $93 million and recorded a gain of $21 million
    ($15 million after income taxes) that is included in Other,

    Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of $25 million
    ($18 million after income taxes) to write down materials
    inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States, the
    majority of which was recorded in Production expenses. During
    2007, the Corporation reduced LIFO inventories, which are
    carried at lower costs than current inventory costs. The effect
    of the LIFO inventory liquidation was to decrease Cost of
    products sold by approximately $38 million
    ($24 million after income taxes).

    fields offshore Norway. The transaction, which has an effective
    date of January 1, 2010, is subject to various regulatory
    and other approvals. In addition, the partners are in
    discussions regarding the applicability of pre-emption to this
    transaction. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the sale
    of its interest in the Jambi Merang Field in Indonesia. The
    Corporation has classified its interests in Gabon, the Clair

The capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to 15
    projects. Approximately 72% of the capitalized well costs in
    excess of one year relate to the Pony and Tubular Bells projects
    in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where development planning is
    underway. In addition, the Corporation plans to drill another
    appraisal well at Pony in 2010. Approximately 12% of the costs
    in excess of one year relate to Western Australia (WA-390-P)
    where further drilling is planned in 2010. The remainder of the
    costs relate to projects where further drilling is planned or
    development planning and other assessment activities are ongoing
    to determine the economic and operating viability of the

In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of
    5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and
    $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a
    coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to
    repay debt under the revolving credit facility and outstanding
    borrowings on other credit facilities. In December 2009, the
    Corporation issued $750 million of 30 year bonds with
    a coupon of 6% and tendered for the $662 million of bonds
    due in August 2011. The Corporation completed the purchase of
    $546 million of the 2011 bonds in December 2009. The
    Corporation recorded a charge of $54 million related to the
    repurchase in Other, net within the Statement of Consolidated
    Income ($34 million after income taxes). The remaining
    $116 million of the 2011 bonds, classified as Current
    maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2009, was
    redeemed in January 2010, resulting in a charge of approximately
    $11 million ($7 million after income taxes).

The aggregate long-term debt maturing during the next five years
    is as follows (in millions): 2010 — $148 (included in
    current liabilities); 2011 — $32; 2012 —
    $34; 2013 — $37 and 2014 — $333.

At December 31, 2009, the Corporation’s fixed rate
    debentures have a principal amount of $4,166 million
    ($4,145 million net of unamortized discount). Interest
    rates on the outstanding fixed rate debentures have a weighted
    average rate of 7.3%.

The Corporation has a $3.0 billion syndicated revolving
    credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings
    and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed
    through May 2012. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation has
    available capacity on the facility of $3.0 billion. Current
    borrowings under the facility bear interest at 0.4% above the
    London Interbank Offered Rate and a facility fee of 0.1% per
    annum is payable on the amount of the facility. The interest
    rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the
    Corporation’s credit rating changes.

The Corporation has a 364 day asset-backed credit facility
    securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing
    and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing
    arrangement, the Corporation has the ability



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1.0 billion
    at December 31, 2009, subject to the availability of
    sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31,
    2009, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were
    collateralized by a total of $1,326 million of accounts
    receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. These
    receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of
    the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding
    obligations under the asset backed facility.

In 2009, the Corporation assumed an additional $65 million
    in fixed rate notes in connection with the acquisition of 37
    previously leased retail gasoline stations.

The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a
    financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings
    and secured debt. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation is
    permitted to borrow up to an additional $18.1 billion for
    the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has
    the ability to borrow up to an additional $3.7 billion of
    secured debt at December 31, 2009.

and $113 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009,
    assuming forfeitures of 2% per year, 11,900,000 outstanding
    options are expected to vest at a weighted average exercise
    price of $53.70 per share. At December 31, 2009, the
    weighted average remaining term of exercisable options was
    6 years.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
    fair value of employee stock options. The following weighted
    average assumptions were utilized for stock options awarded:

The assumption above for the risk free interest rate is based on
    the expected terms of the options and is obtained from published
    sources. The stock price volatility is determined from
    historical experience using the same period as the expected
    terms of the options. The expected stock option term is based on
    historical exercise patterns and the expected future holding
    period.

In May 2008, shareholders approved the 2008 Long-Term Incentive
    Plan. The Corporation also has stock options outstanding under a
    former plan. At December 31, 2009, the number of common
    shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 Long-Term Incentive
    Plan is as follows (in thousands):

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency gains (losses) before income taxes amounted to
    $20 million in 2009, $(212) million in 2008 and
    $17 million in 2007. The foreign currency loss in 2008
    reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements
    in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets,
    liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain
    foreign businesses. The balances in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency
    translation were reductions in stockholders’ equity of
    $18 million at December 31, 2009 and $123 million
    at December 31, 2008.

Retirement
    Plans

The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plans for a significant portion of its employees. In
    addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
    plan covering certain employees. The unfunded supplemental
    pension plan provides for incremental pension payments from the
    Corporation so that total pension payments equal amounts that
    would have been payable from the Corporation’s principal
    pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax
    regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years
    of service and final average salary. Additionally, the
    Corporation maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan
    that provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from
    ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement
    plans is December 31.

Prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of

    period of active employees.

The Corporation’s 2010 pension and postretirement medical

    which approximately $50 million relates to the amortization
    of unrecognized net actuarial losses.

cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are
    based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual
    basis. The discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of
    high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities that
    approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. The
    overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the
    expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the
    target allocation of pension assets to that asset category.

The Corporation’s investment strategy is to maximize
    long-term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad
    diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes.
    Asset classes and target allocations are determined by the
    Corporation’s investment committee and include domestic and
    foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including
    hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers
    are prohibited from investing in securities issued by the
    Corporation unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy.
    The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample
    liquidity for benefit payment requirements. The current target
    allocations for plan assets are 50% equity securities, 25% fixed
    income securities (including cash and short-term investment
    funds) and 25% to all other types of investments. Asset
    allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the
    year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target
    levels.

The following table provides the fair value of the Plan’s

governmental agencies, municipalities and corporations, and
    agency and non-agency mortgage backed securities. This
    investment category also includes commingled investment funds

    securities are generally priced on the basis of evaluated prices
    from independent pricing services. Such prices are monitored and
    provided by an independent, third-party custodial firm
    safekeeping plan assets. Individual fixed income securities are
    classified as Level 2 or 3. Commingled fund values reflect
    the NAV per fund share, derived indirectly from observable
    inputs or from quoted prices in less liquid markets of the
    underlying securities. Fixed income commingled funds are
    classified as Level 2.

Other investments consist of exchange-traded real estate
    investment trust securities as well as commingled fund and
    limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity,
    real estate and diversified commodities. Exchange-traded
    securities are classified as Level 1. Commingled fund
    values reflect the NAV per fund share and are classified as
    Level 2 or 3. Private equity and real estate limited
    partnership values reflect information reported by the fund
    managers, which include inputs such as cost, operating results,
    discounted future cash flows, market based comparable data and
    independent appraisals from third-party sources with
    professional qualifications. Hedge funds, private equity and
    non-exchange-traded real estate investments are classified as

At December 31, 2009, the unrecognized tax benefits include
    $197 million, which if recognized, would affect the
    Corporation’s effective income tax rate. Over the next
    12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount
    of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to
    $25 million due to settlements with taxing authorities.

The Corporation has not recognized deferred income taxes for
    that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
    The Corporation had undistributed earnings from foreign
    subsidiaries expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
    operations of approximately $3.4 billion at
    December 31, 2009. If these earnings were not indefinitely
    reinvested, a deferred tax liability of approximately
    $1.2 billion would be recognized, not accounting for the
    potential utilization of foreign tax credits in the United
    States.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in
    the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The
    Corporation is no longer subject to examinations by income tax
    authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2003.

Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2009, 2008, and 2007
    amounted to $1,177 million, $2,420 million and
    $1,826 million, respectively. The Corporation had accrued

Risk
    Management and Trading Activities

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
    to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude
    oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as
    to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. The
    Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a
    50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership, that are
    exposed to commodity price risks primarily related to the prices
    of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.

The Corporation maintains a control environment under the
    direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate
    risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has
    approved. Controls include volumetric, term and

value-at-risk

limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new
    instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and
    reported on daily to business units and to senior management.
    The Corporation’s risk management department also performs
    independent verifications of sources of fair values and
    validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of
    the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities,
    including the consolidated trading partnership. The
    Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for
    administering foreign exchange and interest rate hedging
    programs.

Following is a description of the Corporation’s activities
    that use derivatives as part of their operations and strategies.
    Derivatives include both financial instruments and forward
    purchase and sale contracts. Gross notional amounts of both long
    and short positions are presented in the volume tables below.
    These amounts include long and short positions that offset in a
    closed position and have not reached contractual maturity. Gross
    notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or
    liabilities of the Corporation, but are used in the calculation
    of cash settlements under the contracts.

Energy Marketing Activities:

In its
    energy marketing activities the Corporation sells refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to
    commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating
    prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as
    futures, forwards, swaps and options, together with physical
    assets such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce
    margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with
    customers.

The table below shows the gross volume of the Corporation’s
    energy marketing commodity contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2009:

Commodity Contracts

Crude oil and refined products (millions of barrels)


Natural gas (millions of mcf)

1,876

Electricity (millions of megawatt hours)


At December 31, 2009, a portion of energy marketing
    commodity contracts are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge
    variability of expected future cash flows of forecasted supply
    transactions. The length of time over which the Corporation
    hedges exposure to variability in future cash flows is
    predominantly two years or less. For contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2009, the maximum duration was five years. The
    Corporation records the effective portion of changes in the fair
    value of cash flow hedges as a component of other comprehensive
    income. Amounts

recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are
    reclassified into Cost of products sold in the same period that
    the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
    portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges is
    recognized immediately in Cost of products sold.

At December 31, 2009, the after-tax deferred losses
    relating to energy marketing activities recorded in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income were $303 million
    ($335 million at December 31, 2008). The Corporation
    estimates that approximately $224 million of this amount
    will be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months.
    During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Corporation reclassified
    after-tax income (losses) from Accumulated other comprehensive
    income of $(596) million, $112 million and
    $(81) million, respectively. The amount of gain (loss) from
    hedge ineffectiveness reflected in earnings in 2009, 2008 and
    2007 was $(2) million in 2009, less than $1 million in
    2008 and $(5) million in 2007. The change in the fair value
    of energy marketing cash flow hedges was $(564) million in
    2009, $(255) million in 2008 and $(3) million in 2007.

The change in fair value of other energy marketing commodity
    contracts that are not designated as hedges are recognized
    currently in earnings. Revenues from the sales contracts are
    recognized in Sales and other operating revenues, supply
    contract purchases are recognized in Cost of products sold and
    net settlements from financial derivatives are recognized in
    Cost of products sold. Net realized and unrealized pre-tax gains
    on derivative contracts not designated as hedges amounted to
    $102 million in 2009.

Corporate Risk Management:

Corporate
    risk management activities include transactions designed to
    reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas
    produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign
    currency movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option
    strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price of a
    portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas
    production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase
    certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with
    the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.

The table below shows the gross volume of Corporate risk
    management derivative instruments outstanding at
    December 31, 2009:

Commodity contracts, primarily crude oil (millions of barrels)*


Foreign exchange contracts (millions of U.S. dollars)


*

Includes gross volumes
    associated with the offsetting crude oil hedge
    positions.

During 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil cash flow
    hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day through 2012 by
    entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty.
    As a result, the valuation of those contracts is no longer
    subject to change due to price fluctuations. There were no other
    open hedges of crude oil or natural gas production at
    December 31, 2009. Hedging activities decreased Exploration
    and Production earnings by $337 million in 2009,
    $423 million in 2008 and $244 million in 2007. The
    pre-tax amount of these hedge losses is reflected in Sales and
    other operating revenue. The gain (loss) from hedge
    ineffectiveness reflected in revenue was less than
    $1 million in 2009, $(13) million in 2008 and
    $6 million in 2007.

At December 31, 2009, the after-tax deferred losses in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income relating to Corporate
    risk management cash flow hedges were $941 million
    ($1,143 million at December 31, 2008). These deferred
    losses result from the Brent crude oil hedges referred to above
    that cover ongoing production of 24,000 barrels per day
    from 2010 through 2012. The Corporation estimates that
    approximately $335 million of this amount will be
    reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months. The
    pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in Accounts
    payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as
    Deferred income tax assets on the balance sheet.

Includes trading derivatives and

The Corporation generally enters into master netting
    arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Master
    netting arrangements are standardized contracts that govern all
    specified transactions with the same counterparty and allow the
    Corporation to terminate all contracts upon occurrence of
    certain events, such as a counterparty’s default or
    bankruptcy. Where these arrangements provide the right of offset
    and the Corporation’s intent and practice is to offset
    amounts in the case of contract terminations, the Corporation
    records fair value on a net basis.

The carrying amounts of the Corporation’s financial
    instruments and derivatives are recorded at their fair values at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, while fixed rate long-term debt
    is recorded at a carrying value of $4,467 million (fair
    value of $5,073 million) at December 31, 2009 and a
    carrying value of $3,103 million (fair value of
    $3,031 million) at December 31, 2008.

Credit Risk:

The Corporation is exposed
    to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain
    counterparties or groups of counterparties. Accounts receivable
    are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer
    base. The Corporation’s net receivables at
    December 31, 2009 are concentrated with counterparties as
    follows: oil and gas companies — 14%, US government
    entities — 13%, manufacturers — 12% and
    domestic and foreign trading companies — 11%. The
    Corporation reduces its risk related to certain counterparties
    by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral,
    generally cash or letters of credit. The Corporation records the
    cash collateral received or posted as an offset of the fair
    value of derivatives executed with the same counterparty. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Corporation is holding cash
    from counterparties of approximately $317 million and
    $705 million, respectively. The Corporation has posted cash
    to counterparties at December 31, 2009 and 2008 of
    approximately $269 million and $394 million,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2009, the Corporation had a total of
    $2,847 million of outstanding letters of credit, primarily
    issued to satisfy margin requirements. Certain of the
    Corporation’s agreements also contain contingent collateral
    provisions that could require the Corporation to post additional
    collateral if the Corporation’s credit rating declines. As
    of December 31, 2009, the net liability related to
    derivatives with contingent collateral provisions was
    approximately $2,120 million before cash collateral posted
    of approximately $260 million. At December 31, 2009,
    all three major credit rating agencies that rate the
    Corporation’s debt had assigned an investment grade rating.
    If two of the three agencies were to downgrade the
    Corporation’s rating to below investment grade, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Corporation would be required to
    post additional collateral of approximately $281 million.

Guarantees
    and Contingencies

At December 31, 2009, the Corporation’s guarantees
    include $121 million of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases
    and $15 million of HOVENSA’s senior debt obligations.
    In addition, the Corporation has $100 million in letters of
    credit for which it is contingently liable. As a result, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that the Corporation
    could be required to make under its guarantees is
    $236 million at December 31, 2009 ($219 million
    at December 31, 2008). The Corporation also has a
    contingent purchase obligation expiring in April 2012, to
    acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline
    station joint venture. As of December 31, 2009, the
    estimated value of the purchase obligation is approximately
    $184 million.

The Corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to
    various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, including
    environmental matters. A liability is recognized in the
    Corporation’s consolidated financial statements when it is
    probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the
    amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is
    only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however,
    the Corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies.

The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in
    refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits
    and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether
    (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving
    water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in
    jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE
    and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE,
    including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases
    is that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that
    these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share
    of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and
    are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged
    effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the
    majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In
    February 2010, the Corporation reached an agreement in principle
    to settle all but three of the remaining cases. The three
    unresolved cases consist of two cases that have been
    consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the Southern District of
    New York as part of a multi-district litigation proceeding and
    an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire.
    In 2007, a pre-tax charge of $40 million was recorded to
    cover all of the known MTBE cases against the Corporation.

Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
    consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining
    facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New
    Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission
    controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that
    impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements,
    which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on
    petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed
    substantial civil fines and penalties and required
    (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions
    control equipment over a three to eight year time period and
    (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased
    operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and
    supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries
    covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on
    the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of
    the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has
    previously installed more advanced pollution controls. The EPA
    initially contacted the Corporation and HOVENSA regarding the
    Petroleum Refinery Initiative in August 2003. Negotiations with
    the EPA and the relevant states and the Virgin Islands are
    continuing and substantial progress has been made toward
    resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA.
    While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining
    Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is
    reached and entered by a court, additional significant future
    capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be
    incurred by HOVENSA over a number of years. The amount of
    penalties, if any, is not expected to be material.

The United States Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (the
    Act) implemented a royalty relief program that relieves eligible
    leases issued between November 28, 1995 and
    November 28, 2000 from paying royalties on deepwater
    production in Federal Outer Continental Shelf lands. The Act
    does not impose any price thresholds in order to qualify for the
    royalty relief. The U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS)
    created regulations that included pricing requirements to
    qualify for the royalty relief provided in the Act. During the
    period from 2003 to



HESS
    CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2009, the Corporation accrued the royalties imposed by the MMS
    regulations. The legality of the thresholds imposed by the MMS
    was challenged in the federal courts and, in October 2009, the
    U.S. Supreme Court decided not to review the appellate
    court’s decision against the MMS. As a result, the
    Corporation recognized a pre-tax gain of $143 million
    ($89 million after income taxes) in 2009 to reverse all
    previously recorded royalties. The pre-tax gain is reported in
    Other, net within the Statement of Consolidated Income.

The Corporation is also currently subject to certain other
    existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings, which it considers
    routine and incidental to its business. The Corporation believes
    that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related
    to any of these other known contingent liability exposures would
    have a material adverse impact on its financial position or
    results of operations.

Segment
    Information

The Corporation has two operating segments that comprise the
    structure used by senior management to make key operating
    decisions and assess performance. These are (1) Exploration
    and Production and (2) Marketing and Refining. The
    Exploration and Production segment explores for, develops,
    produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural
    gas. The Marketing and Refining segment manufactures refined
    petroleum products and purchases, trades and markets refined
    petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.

Oil and
    Gas Reserves

The Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves are
    calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and the
    requirements of the FASB. Proved oil and gas reserves are
    quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering
    data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be
    economically producible from known reservoirs under existing
    economic conditions, operating methods and government
    regulations. The Corporation’s estimation of net
    recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is
    a highly technical process performed by internal teams of
    geoscience professionals and reservoir engineers. Estimates of
    reserves were prepared by the use of standard engineering and
    geoscience methods generally accepted in the petroleum industry.
    The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of
    each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the
    completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the
    estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production
    history. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in
    reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These
    technologies, including computational methods, must have been
    field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain
    results with consistency and repeatability in the formation
    being evaluated or in an analogous formation.

Commencing in 2009, the product prices used in the estimation of
    oil and gas reserves were the average oil and gas selling prices
    during the twelve month period prior to the reporting date
    determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the

first-day-of-the-month

price for each month within such period, except for prices set
    in contractual arrangements. In order for reserves to be
    classified as proved, any required government approvals must be
    obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior
    management or the board of directors must commit to fund the
    development.

The Corporation’s proved reserves are subject to certain
    risks and uncertainties. These risks include commodity price
    risk, technical risk and political risk. Reference is made to
    Item 1A,

Risk Factors Related to Our Business and
    Operations

on page 11 of this

Form 10-K.



Internal
    Controls

The Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas
    reserve estimation process which are administered by the
    Corporation’s Senior Vice President of E&P Technology
    and its Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are
    prepared by technical staff that work directly with the oil and
    gas properties using standard reserve estimation guidelines,
    definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates for
    a selection of the Corporation’s assets are subject to
    internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an
    independent third party reserve engineer reviews and audits a
    significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves
    (see below). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management
    and the Board of Directors.

Qualifications

The person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation
    of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves is Mr. Scott
    Heck, Senior Vice President of E&P Technology.
    Mr. Heck is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers
    with 30 years of industry experience in oil and gas
    reservoir management and reserve estimation.

Reserves
    Audit

The Corporation engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and
    MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally
    prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating
    approximately 80% of 2009 year-end reported reserve
    quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The purpose of
    the report dated January 15, 2010 was to provide additional
    assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve
    estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M
    letter report on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas
    reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering
    methods generally accepted in the petroleum industry. D&M
    is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has
    been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the
    world for over 70 years. The D&M letter report on the
    Corporation’s December 31, 2009 oil and gas reserves
    is included as an exhibit to this

Form 10-K.

While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the
    report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M,
    the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and
    audited by D&M, in the aggregate, did not differ
    materially. The report also includes among other information,
    the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible
    for overseeing such reserve audit.

Effect of
    adopting new SEC requirements

The SEC issued a final rule on oil and gas reserve estimation
    and disclosure effective for year-end 2009 reporting. The
    SEC’s final rule was designed to modernize and update the
    oil and gas reserve disclosure requirements to align them with
    current industry practices and changes in technology. In January
    2010, the FASB issued its final accounting standards update,
    Extractive Industries — Oil and Gas (ASC 932), which
    principally conformed existing FASB standards to the new SEC
    guidelines. Since it was not practical to calculate reserve
    estimates under both the old and new reserve estimation
    standards as of year end, it is not possible to precisely
    measure the effect of adopting the new SEC requirements on total
    proved reserves at December 31, 2009. However, the
    Corporation estimates that the effect of initially applying the
    new rules, primarily due to application of the new reserve
    definitions and the consideration of permitted technology, was
    to increase year end 2009 total proved reserves by approximately
    2%. The change in reserve estimates resulting from applying the
    new rules is included in the table below as 2009 revisions and
    additions to proved reserves. The Corporation estimates that the
    effect of adopting the new rules on its net income in 2010 will
    be an increase of approximately $80 million, after tax, due
    to lower depreciation, depletion and amortization costs,
    assuming 2010 budgeted production levels for the affected fields
    occur as forecasted.

Proved
    undeveloped reserves

The December 31, 2009 oil and gas reserve estimates
    disclosed below include 374 million barrels of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 1,276 million mcf of natural gas
    classified as proved undeveloped reserves. Proved undeveloped
    liquid reserves decreased in 2009, primarily due to the
    commencement of production from the Shenzi Field in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Proved undeveloped natural gas
    reserves also decreased in 2009 due to the continuation of
    development activities in Block

A-18

in the
    JDA. In addition, as part of its normal production operations,
    the



Corporation’s drilling programs on existing fields resulted
    in the reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to
    developed. In 2009, these changes occurred primarily at certain
    fields in the United States, Equatorial Guinea, Azerbaijan and
    Russia. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Corporation estimates that capital expenditures of approximately
    $450 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped
    reserves to proved developed reserves. The Corporation is
    involved in multiple long term projects that have staged
    developments. Certain of these projects have proved reserves,
    which have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess
    of five years, totaling approximately 145 million barrels
    of oil equivalent, or 10% of year end 2009 total proved
    reserves. The proved undeveloped reserves in excess of five
    years are related to gas projects in Block

A-18

in the
    JDA, Indonesia, and Norway that are being developed in phases to
    satisfy long-term gas sales contracts and an oil project in
    Azerbaijan that is still under development.

Following are the Corporation’s proved reserves for the
    three years ended December 31, 2009:

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

Future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil
    and gas selling prices used in determining year-end reserve
    estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual
    arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and
    gas reserves, less estimated future development and production
    costs, which are based on year-end costs and existing economic
    assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying
    the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates to the pre-tax net
    cash flows relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas
    reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed
    rate of 10%. The discounted future net cash flow estimates do
    not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate
    general and administrative expenses. The selling prices of crude
    oil and natural gas are highly volatile. The prices which are
    required to be used for the



discounted future net cash flows do not include the effects of
    hedges and may not be representative of future selling prices.
    The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different
    if other assumptions were used.
