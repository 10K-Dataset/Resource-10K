Overview

Incyte is a drug discovery and development company, focused on developing small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs.
Our pipeline is focused in the areas of oncology and inflammation and includes compounds in various stages of development, ranging from preclinical to late-stage development.

Our
two most advanced programs involve our janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Oral INCB18424 is in clinical development for the treatment of several myeloproliferative neoplasms and is part
of a collaboration agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. in which Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to
INCB18424 for hematologic and oncology indications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. The World Health Organization has accepted ruxolitinib as
the International Nonproprietary Name for INCB18424. We intend to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for ruxolitinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis in the first half of 2011. We are planning to
launch our first commercial product in late 2011 if our NDA is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Oral
INCB28050, (now known as LY3009104) is in clinical development for rheumatoid arthritis by Eli Lilly and Company under a collaboration agreement. Lilly received exclusive worldwide
development and commercialization rights for the compound for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases; however, last year we exercised our co-development rights for rheumatoid arthritis in
exchange for royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties. We believe these strategic relationships increase the likelihood of the successful development and commercialization of these compounds.

We
are engaged in a number of other development programs evaluating our novel cMET, IDO and Sheddase inhibitors and are also continuing to invest in our discovery efforts.

Clinical Programs

JAK Programs for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Oncology and Inflammation

The JAK family is composed of four tyrosine kinases—JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2—that are involved in signaling
triggered by a number of cytokines and growth factors. JAKs are central to a number of biologic processes, including the formation and development of blood cells and the regulation of immune
functions. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been associated with a number of diseases, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, other hematological malignancies, solid
cancers, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (also referred to as myeloproliferative disorders) are a closely related group of blood diseases in which blood cells,
specifically platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells, grow or act abnormally in the bone marrow. These diseases include myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.

We
have discovered multiple potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK inhibitors that are selective for JAK1 and JAK2. Our lead JAK inhibitor for hematologic and oncology
indications, ruxolitinib, is in Phase III development for myelofibrosis, Phase III development for polycythemia vera and Phase II development for essential thrombocythemia. It is
also in Phase I/II development for other solid tumors and other hematologic malignancies and in Phase IIb development as a topical treatment for psoriasis. Our lead JAK inhibitor for
inflammation, LY3009104, is currently in Phase IIb development by Lilly as an oral treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, topical INCB18424 is in Phase IIb development for the
treatment of psoriasis.



Myelofibrosis.

Myelofibrosis is a rare but serious, life-threatening condition. Myelofibrosis, considered the most serious of the
myeloproliferative neoplasms, can occur either as primary myelofibrosis, or as secondary myelofibrosis that develops in a proportion of polycythemia vera patients, and to a lesser extent in patients
with essential thrombocythemia. Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are also myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Most
myelofibrosis patients have enlarged spleens and many suffer from debilitating symptoms, including fatigue, abdominal discomfort, pruritus (itching), night sweats and cachexia
(weight loss). There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for myelofibrosis.

There
is a clear unmet medical need for new therapies that better address the clinical manifestations of myelofibrosis. We estimate, based on the available literature as well as our own
research using insurance claims databases, that there are currently 16,000 - 18,500 myelofibrosis patients in the United States.

In
July 2009, we obtained a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement from the FDA for the Phase III registration trial, COMFORT-I, for ruxolitinib for
myelofibrosis. Based on the SPA agreement, we expect this to be the only pivotal trial required for approval in the United States.

COMFORT-I
is a randomized double-blind Phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib to placebo in 309 patients with primary myelofibrosis,
post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis and involving over 100 clinical sites in the United States, Australia and Canada. In late
December 2010, we announced top-line results from COMFORT-I. The primary endpoint was the response rate defined as the percentage of patients achieving a 35% or greater
reduction in spleen volume at 24 weeks as measured by magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography, comparing the rates in patients receiving ruxolitinib or placebo. The response rate
was 42% in patients randomized to ruxolitinib versus less than 1% of patients randomized to placebo. High levels of statistical significance were also achieved for the key secondary endpoints based on
symptomatic improvement as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form Diary. The safety profile of ruxolitinib was consistent with previous studies, with the most common adverse
effects being reversible thrombocytopenia and anemia.

COMFORT-II
is a second Phase III trial being conducted by Novartis in Europe. It is a randomized, controlled, open-label study designed to evaluate the
efficacy, safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib as compared to the best-available therapy in patients with primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or
post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. COMFORT-II has enrolled 219 patients and involves approximately 55 clinical sites in 9 European countries: Belgium,
Austria, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The primary efficacy endpoint in COMFORT-II is the proportion of patients achieving at least 35% reduction in
spleen volume from baseline to week 48. COMFORT-II is the pivotal trial for European Marketing Authorization (MAA). We expect that supportive data from this clinical trial will be included
in our NDA. Novartis has responsibility for the MAA submission, which is targeted for mid-year.

We
have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for ruxolitinib as a treatment for myelofibrosis and orphan medicinal product designation from the European Medicines Agency for
ruxolitinib for the treatment of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis and also for the treatment of
myelofibrosis secondary to polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for ruxolitinib for the treatment of polycythemia vera and essential
thrombocythemia.

Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia.

Polycythemia vera is a rare but serious myeloproliferative neoplasm and occurs when
the bone marrow
produces too many blood cells, especially red blood cells. Polycythemia vera patients can have similar symptoms as myelofibrosis patients, including enlarged spleens and debilitating symptoms such as
fatigue, abdominal discomfort, pruritus (itching), night sweats and cachexia (weight loss). While there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for polycythemia vera, several treatments
are used to manage the signs and symptoms of the disease, including the removal



of
blood (phlebotomy) and treatment with myelosuppressive therapies. About a third of the patients can become resistant to or intolerant of these approaches and there is an unmet medical need for new
therapies to treat this subset of patients. We estimate, based on the available literature and published databases, that there are currently 95,000 polycythemia vera patients in the United States.

In
September 2010, we obtained an SPA agreement from the FDA for a Phase III clinical trial for ruxolitinib in patients with advanced polycythemia vera. In October, we initiated
with Novartis a joint global Phase III trial, RESPONSE, in patients who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. The trial is a randomized, open label trial that will compare the efficacy
and safety of ruxolitinib to best available therapy. The primary composite endpoint is both phlebotomy independence and at least a 35% spleen volume reduction at week 32. Key secondary endpoints are
the proportion of patients who both achieve the primary response endpoint and maintain response for an additional 48 weeks and the proportion of patients achieving complete hematologic
remission at week 32. The trial is expected to include approximately 300 patients. Novartis opened the trial in countries outside of the United States in early 2011.

In
December 2010, we presented long-term clinical results from an ongoing open-label Phase II trial for ruxolitinib in patients with advanced polycythemia
vera and essential thrombocythemia. The data, showing long-term clinical activity, including reduction in spleen size, phlebotomy independence (in patients with polycythemia vera) and
improvement in blood counts lasting up to 27 months, were presented in an oral session at the 52nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. With a median duration of
21 months of follow-up, clinical responses observed in 34 patients enrolled with polycythemia vera included durable improvements in splenomegaly (spleen enlargement), hematocrit
control and symptomatic burden, including pruritus (itching), night sweats and bone pain. Clinical responses seen in 39 patients enrolled with essential thrombocythemia included long-term
reductions in elevated platelet and white blood cell counts, and, when present, splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Ruxolitinib was well-tolerated.

Additional Clinical Activities in Oncology.

Additional clinical studies are planned to evaluate the use of ruxolitinib in other
malignant diseases.
We anticipate the initiation of a Phase II trial in lymphoma and a Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer in 2011.

There
are several ongoing investigator sponsored Phase I/II trials evaluating ruxolitinib in other indications. The Children's Oncology Group, in collaboration with the National
Cancer Institute, is conducting a pediatric Phase I/II trial in patients with solid tumors/hematological malignancies. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center is conducting two trials, a Phase II
trial in patients with refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies and a Phase I/II trial in patients with acute leukemias (acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia).

Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by aberrant or abnormal immune mechanisms that lead
to joint
inflammation and swelling and, in some patients, the progressive destruction of joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can also affect connective tissue in the skin and organs of the body.

Current
rheumatoid arthritis treatments include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as
methotrexate, and the newer biological response modifiers that target tumor necrosis factor, a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. None of
these approaches to treatment is curative and, therefore, there is an unmet need for new safe and effective treatment options for these patients. Rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to affect about 1%
of the world population.

We
have a second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, LY3009104, which is the lead compound in our inflammation program and subject to our collaboration agreement with Lilly. In November 2010, we
presented the final six-month clinical data from the dose ranging, placebo-controlled Phase IIa trial of LY3009104 in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis at the 2010 American
College of Rheumatology / Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals Annual Scientific Meeting.



Results
from the 125-patient Phase IIa trial demonstrated that all three doses, 4, 7 and 10 milligrams once a day, of oral LY3009104 improved on the primary endpoint,
the percent of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 improvement, over the full 24-week treatment period. Evidence of improvement was seen as early as the first
assessment at two weeks and efficacy results continued to improve from week 12 to week 24 across ACR response categories as well. Responses were similar in both biologic-experienced and
biologic-naïve patients and adverse events for all three doses were predominantly mild-to-moderate with frequencies similar to placebo.

Based
upon these results, in July 2010 we exercised our option to co-develop this compound in RA. We will be responsible for 30% of all future development costs for this
indication through regulatory approval in exchange for royalties ranging up to the high twenties on potential future sales. In October 2010, Lilly initiated a Phase IIb trial in patients poorly
controlled on methotrexate. This trial is a global, dose-ranging study expected to involve 270 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.

Psoriasis (Topical Formulation).

Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes visible scaling and inflammation as well as pain, swelling,
heat, and
redness. Most psoriasis patients have patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales that can occur on the elbows, knees, other parts of the legs, scalp, lower back, face, palms, and soles of the
feet. Market research suggests that neither physicians nor patients are satisfied with existing psoriasis treatments primarily because these require constant monitoring to balance safety and efficacy
outcomes, and many topical treatments are limited to short-term use. There is clear unmet need for a better tolerated and effective topical treatment. The United States psoriasis market
consists of approximately six million patients, of which mild to moderate patients, who tend to prefer topical treatments, account for approximately 85% of the market.

Results
from a multi-center three-month Phase IIb trial comparing three once-daily doses of topical INCB18424 to vehicle in 200 patients with
mild-to-moderate psoriasis were disclosed at both oral and poster presentations at the Society of Dermatology Meeting, in May 2010. We are seeking a collaborator for the
development of this compound.

c-MET for Solid Tumors

c-MET is a clinically validated receptor kinase cancer target. Abnormal c-MET activation in cancer correlates
with poor prognosis. Dysregulation of the c-MET pathway triggers tumor growth, formation of new blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients, and causes cancer to spread to other
organs. Dysregulation of the c-MET pathway is seen in many types of cancers, including kidney, liver, stomach, breast, and brain.

Several
small molecule c-MET kinase inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in a number of cancers; however, these molecules have limited potency and are relatively
non-selective, which could lead to off-target toxicities. We believe our lead c-MET inhibitor, INCB28060, has the requisite properties to overcome these
limitations, including greater selectivity, improved potency and more effective inhibition of c-MET. Under our agreement, Novartis received worldwide exclusive development and
commercialization rights to INCB28060 and certain back-up compounds in all indications. We initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial in early 2010 that is expected to include
approximately 50 patients with solid tumors. We anticipate that this trial will conclude in 2011 and we will then transition the program to Novartis.

Sheddase Inhibitor Program for Solid Tumors

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in American women. HER2-positive breast cancer is a breast
cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cancer cells. In about one of every four breast cancers, the cancer cells
make an excess of HER2 due to a gene mutation. HER2-positive breast cancers tend to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. While there are treatments that specifically
target HER2, there is a subset of HER2-positive patients referred to as p95HER2-positive. These



p95HER2-positive
patients tend to be resistant to trastuzumab (Herceptin)-based therapies and have poor clinical outcomes as compared to other HER2-positive patients. There is
an unmet patient need for new treatments that can be used in this subset of HER2-positive patients. We estimate that approximately 20%-40% of HER2-positive patients
are p95HER2-positive.

We
have identified novel, potent, and orally available small-molecule inhibitors of sheddase. Sheddase is an enzyme that is believed to activate all four epidermal growth factor
receptors that play a key role in the growth and survival of multiple tumor types, including breast, colorectal, and non-small lung cancers. INCB7839, our lead sheddase compound, is in
Phase II clinical development for breast cancer, evaluating its effectiveness when used in combination with trastuzumab. In June 2010, we presented additional data from this ongoing
Phase II clinical trial involving 66 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. These results suggest that, when compared to a historical control study of trastuzumab as
monotherapy, INCB7839 in combination with trastuzumab may provide improvements in time to progression and response rate in p95HER2-positive patients. In an effort to confirm this
hypothesis with a larger data set, we have been conducting an analysis of tissue samples from HER2-positive breast cancer patients for p95 assay validation and to better define the
expected rate of progression in this subset of patients. If this biomarker research proves supportive, we intend to meet with the FDA to
determine if a Phase III program in p95HER2-positive breast cancer patients could serve as the basis for regulatory approval.

IDO for Solid Tumors

Solid tumors are named for the type of cells that form them, for example, sarcomas, carcinomas, and lymphomas. Frequently, the term
"solid tumors" collectively refers to cancer in major organs. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 1,500,000 Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2010, of which more than 830,000
patients will be diagnosed with solid tumors such as lung, prostate, colon, rectum or breast cancer. The American Cancer Society also estimates that approximately 560,000 patients are expected
ultimately to die from cancer in 2010.

The
enzyme, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, IDO, is a key regulator of the mechanisms that are responsible for allowing tumors to escape from a patient's immune surveillance.
IDO expression by tumor cells, or by antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells in tumors, creates an environment in which tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are rendered
functionally inactive or are no longer able to attack a patient's cancer cells. By inhibiting IDO, it is proposed that this "brake" on the anti-tumor immune response is removed, allowing
anti-tumor specific cytotoxic T cells, generated in a patient spontaneously in response to the tumor, or through a therapy designed to stimulate the immune response, to have greater
anti-tumor efficacy.

We
believe our compound, INCB24360, represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO. It is efficacious in multiple mouse models of cancer and has been
well-tolerated in preclinical safety studies. We initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial in patients with solid tumors in the third quarter of 2010.

11ßHSD1 Program for Type 2 Diabetes and Related Disorders

We have developed a broad chemically diverse series of novel proprietary oral inhibitors of 11ßHSD1, an enzyme that
converts the biologically-inactive steroid cortisone into the potent biologically-active hormone cortisol. Cortisol acts as a functional antagonist of insulin action in multiple tissue types,
including the liver, adipose, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Inhibition of 11ßHSD1 offers the potential to reduce insulin resistance and restore glycemic control in type 2 diabetes,
and may also offer potential benefits in allied conditions such as dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease.



Because
diabetes is outside of our core focus in oncology and inflammation, we are seeking a collaborator for this program.

Discovery

We have a number of early discovery programs at various stages of preclinical testing.

License Agreements

Novartis

In November 2009, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis
received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including
all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. We retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib in the United States and in certain other
indications. Novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c-MET inhibitor compound INCB28060 and certain back-up compounds in all
indications. We retained options to co-develop and to co-promote INCB28060 in the United States.

Under
this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to
approximately $1.1 billion
if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved. In 2010, we received $50 million in milestone payments for the initiation of the global Phase III trial, RESPONSE,
in patients with polycythemia vera. We also could receive tiered, double digit royalties on future ruxolitinib sales outside of the United States. Each company is responsible for costs relating to the
development and commercialization of the JAK inhibitor compound in its respective territories, with costs of collaborative studies shared equally. Novartis is responsible for all costs relating to the
development and commercialization of the c-MET inhibitor compound after the initial Phase I clinical trial.

The
Novartis agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until Novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier,
the termination of the agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis
by Novartis for convenience. The agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

Lilly

In December 2009, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company. Under the terms of
the agreement, Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to LY3009104 and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We received
an initial payment of $90 million, and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to $665 million based on the achievement of defined development, regulatory and
commercialization milestones. In 2010, we received $49 million in milestone payments from Lilly. We also could receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global sales with rates
ranging up to 20% if the product is successfully commercialized.

We
retained options to co-develop our JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors with Lilly on a compound-by-compound and indication-by-indication
basis. Lilly will be responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the compounds unless we elect to co-develop any compounds or indications. If we elect to
co-develop any compounds and/or indications, we would be responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs from the initiation of a Phase IIb trial. We
would receive an incremental royalty rate increase across all tiers resulting in effective royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties on potential future global sales for compounds and/or
indications that we elect to co-develop. We



also
retained an option to co-promote products in the United States. In July 2010, we elected to co-develop LY3009104 with Lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are
responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of a Phase IIb trial through regulatory approval. The Lilly agreement will
continue until Lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms. The agreement may be terminated by Lilly for
convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

Pfizer

In January 2006, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the pursuit of our CCR2
antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications,
with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on pre-clinical
development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement. Prior to such
expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. In addition, Pfizer may terminate the
agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. We received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006 and are eligible to receive
additional future development and milestone payments. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007 and a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2010.

Incyte's Approach to Drug Discovery and Development

Our productivity in drug discovery and development is primarily a result of our core competency in medicinal chemistry which is tightly
integrated with, and supported by, an experienced team of biologists with expertise in multiple therapeutic areas. As a number of our compounds have progressed into clinical development, we have also
built a clinical development and regulatory team. This team utilizes clinical research organizations (CROs), expert scientific advisory boards, and leading consultants and suppliers in relevant drug
development areas in an effort to conduct our clinical trials efficiently and effectively, while maintaining strategic control of the design and management of our programs.

To
succeed in our objective to create a pipeline of novel, orally available drugs that address serious unmet medical needs, we have established a broad range of discovery capabilities
in-house, including target validation, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and pharmacological and ADME (absorption, distribution,
metabolism and excretion) assessment. We augment these capabilities through collaborations with academic and contract laboratory resources with relevant expertise.

We
select drug targets with strong preclinical or clinical validation in areas where we have the potential to generate either first-in-class molecules or
compounds that are highly differentiated from existing treatments.

Our
chemistry and biology efforts are highly integrated and are characterized by the rapid generation of relevant data on a broad and diverse range of compounds for each therapeutic
target we pursue. This process allows our scientists to better understand the potency and selectivity of the compounds, how they are likely to be absorbed and eliminated in the body, and to assess the
potential safety profile of the compounds. We believe that this approach, along with stringent criteria for the selection of clinical candidates, allows us to select appropriate candidates for
clinical development and assess key characteristics required for success.



Given
our chemistry-driven discovery process, our pipeline has grown to encompass multiple therapeutic areas, primarily in the areas of oncology and inflammation. We conduct a limited
number of discovery programs in parallel at any one time. This focus allows us to allocate resources to our selected programs at a level that we believe is competitive with much larger pharmaceutical
companies. We believe this level of resource allocation, applied to the discovery process outlined above, has been a critical competitive advantage in advancing our product pipeline.

Additionally,
in all of our programs we strive to generate a broad range of proprietary compounds which we believe enhances the overall probability of success for our programs and
creates the potential for multiple products.

Once
our compounds reach clinical development, our objective, whenever possible, is to rapidly progress the lead candidate into a proof-of-concept Phase II
clinical trial to quickly assess the therapeutic potential of the clinical candidate itself and its underlying mechanism. This information is then used to evaluate the commercial potential of the
compound, the most appropriate indication or indications to pursue, and whether to pursue any development on our own or seek a strategic relationship for the compound.

Incyte's Development Teams

Our development teams are responsible for ensuring that our clinical candidates are expeditiously progressed from preclinical
development and IND-enabling studies into human testing. To keep pace with the growth in our clinical pipeline, we have added new members to the development teams by internal transfers and
by recruiting new employees with expertise in drug development including clinical trial design, statistics, regulatory affairs, medical affairs and project management. We have also built core internal
process chemistry and formulation teams using this same strategy. Rather than build extensive infrastructure, we work with external CROs with expertise in managing clinical trials, process chemistry,
product formulation, and the manufacture of clinical trial supplies to support our drug development efforts.

Commercial Strategy

Our strategy is to develop and commercialize our compounds on our own in selected markets when we believe a company of our size can
successfully compete, such as in myelofibrosis, other myeloproliferative neoplasms, other oncology indications and certain inflammatory conditions. We intend to file a New Drug Application with
the FDA to secure regulatory approval of ruxolitinib in myelofibrosis in the United States. We are building the marketing, medical and operational infrastructure to support commercialization of
ruxolitinib in myelofibrosis in the United States. In 2010, the marketing team focused the majority of its efforts on conducting quantitative and qualitative market research among physicians and
patients, initiating brand development work, and progressing development of the generic and trade names. We anticipate hiring approximately 60 sales representatives and 6 regional managers in the
second half of 2011 to support the expected launch of ruxolitinib.

For
rights outside the United States to ruxolitinib as well as for pipeline compounds that are outside of our core expertise or would require expensive clinical studies, we have
established or are seeking to establish collaborations or strategic relationships to support development and commercialization. We established a collaboration with Novartis in 2009 for rights in
certain indications outside of the United States to our JAK oncology program with ruxolitinib and specified backups, as well as worldwide rights to our c-MET inhibitor compound INCB28060.
We also established a collaboration with Lilly in 2009 for our JAK inflammation and autoimmune program with LY3009104 and specified back-ups, and with Pfizer in 2005 to advance our CCR2
antagonist program. We believe the key benefits to entering into strategic relationships include the potential to receive upfront payments and future milestones and royalties in exchange for certain
rights to our compounds, as well as the potential to expedite the development and commercialization of certain of our compounds.



Patents and Other Intellectual Property

We regard the protection of patents and other enforceable intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our
business and competitive position. Accordingly, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright law, as well as nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual property. We
have established a patent portfolio of patents and patent applications owned by us that cover aspects of all our drug candidates. The patents and patent applications relating to our drug candidates
generally include claims directed to the drug candidates, methods of using the drug candidates, formulations of the drug candidates, pharmaceutical salt forms of the drug candidates, and methods of
manufacturing the drug candidates. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries we believe that are commercially important to the development and growth of our business.
The following table sets forth the status of the patents and patent applications in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, covering our drug candidates that have progressed into at least
Phase II clinical trials:

Patents
extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual
protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.

We
may seek to license rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may be required to pay
up-front fees, license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products.

Although
we believe our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly
uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes,
and may not be able to obtain patents in the United States or elsewhere from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be
valid or enforceable or may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us or provide us with a competitive advantage. Any patent or other intellectual property rights that we
own or obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. Others may have patents that relate to our business or technology and that may prevent us from marketing our product
candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. In addition, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce patents, to
protect our other intellectual property rights, to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties or to defend ourselves in patent or other intellectual property right
suits brought by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in such litigation or other proceedings. An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant
liability.

With
respect to proprietary information that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality
agreements to protect our interests. While we require all employees, consultants and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our
trade secrets or other proprietary



information.
Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.

Competition

Our drug discovery and development activities face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. Our major competitors include fully integrated pharmaceutical companies that have
extensive drug discovery efforts and are developing novel small molecule pharmaceuticals. We face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with
our potential products.

Many
companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs
than we do. In addition, many competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in:

•

drug discovery;

•

developing products;

•

undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials;

•

obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and

•

manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling products.

Accordingly,
our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA and other regulatory approval or commercializing products before we do. If we commence commercial
product sales, we will be competing against companies with greater manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience.

In
addition, any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise
from:

•

other drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease;

•

new small molecules; or

•

other classes of therapeutic agents.

Developments
by others may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative
arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to proprietary technology. These competitors,
either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing products that are more effective than ours.

Our
ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

•

develop proprietary products;

•

develop and maintain products that reach the market first, are technologically superior to and/or are of lower cost than
other products in the market;

•

attract and retain scientific, product development and sales and marketing personnel;

•

obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;

•

obtain required regulatory approvals; and

•

manufacture, market, distribute and sell any products that we develop.



In
a number of countries, including in particular, developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs available at
a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major
pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for their drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit enforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in
those countries, and in other countries by importation from low-price countries, could be reduced by generic competition or by parallel importation of our product. Alternatively,
governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products in those countries, thereby reducing our
product sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products. In all of these situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Government Regulation

Our ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and marketing of our potential small molecule products to treat
medical conditions are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any drug developed by us
must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its
implementing regulations. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion,
sale and distribution and import and export, of these products. None of our drug candidates has, to date, been submitted for approval for sale in the United States or any foreign market. The
regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Securing FDA approval requires the
submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication to establish a drug candidate's safety and efficacy. The approval process takes many
years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources, involves post-marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. Before
commencing clinical investigations of a drug candidate in humans, we must submit an Investigational New Drug application (IND), which must by reviewed by FDA.

The
steps generally required before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:

•

preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with FDA's Good Laboratory Practice
regulations;

•

submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may
commence;

•

performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish
the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;

•

submission of a new drug application to the FDA for review;

•

random inspections of clinical sites to ensure validity of clinical data around safety and efficacy

•

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to
assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices;

•

FDA approval of the NDA; and

•

payment of user and establishment fees, if applicable.



Similar
requirements exist within foreign agencies as well. The time required to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially
based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.

Preclinical
testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and toxicity which includes animal studies, to assess potential safety and efficacy as well
as product chemistry, stability, formulation, development, and testing. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as
part of an IND. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of
the clinical trials as outlined in the IND. In the latter case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure
that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

Clinical
trials involve the administration of the investigational drug or the marketed drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with good
clinical practices regulations covering the protection of human subjects. These regulations require all research subjects to provide informed consent. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols
detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and
each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board (IRB) before it can begin.

Clinical
trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the
investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.

Phase II
usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and
evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications.

Phase III
clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical
evidence of efficacy and safety, and providing an adequate basis for labeling.

We
cannot guarantee that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the
IRB, or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

As
a separate amendment to an IND, a clinical trial sponsor may submit a request for a special protocol assessment (SPA) from the FDA. Under the SPA procedure, a sponsor may seek the
FDA's agreement on the design and size of a clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. If the FDA agrees in writing, its agreement may not be changed after the trial
begins, except in limited circumstances, such as when a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate is identified after a Phase III
clinical trial is commenced and agreement is obtained with the FDA. If the outcome of the trial is successful, the sponsor will ordinarily be able to rely on it as the primary basis for approval with
respect to effectiveness. The FDA, however, may make an approval decision based on a number of factors, including the degree of clinical benefit, and the FDA is not obligated to approve an NDA as a
result of an SPA, even if the clinical outcome is positive.

Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies, including post-approval trials, or Phase IV studies, may be required to provide additional data and
will be required to gain approval for the sale of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA will require
post-approval reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand the indications for which the drug product



may
be marketed. Further, if there are any requests for modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing
facilities, a supplemental NDA may be required to be submitted to the FDA.

The
length of time and related costs necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying
interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or cause the costs of these clinical trials to
increase, include:

•

slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility
criteria for the study, competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates or other factors;

•

inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials;

•

delays in approvals from a study site's IRB;

•

longer than anticipated treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or determine the appropriate product dose;

•

lack of sufficient supplies of the drug candidate for use in clinical trials;

•

adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and

•

lack of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested.

Any
drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of
time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level, and at any time in the course of animal studies designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as
toxicological studies, or in clinical trials of our potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay
or abort the development of any of our drug candidates, and could ultimately prevent their marketing approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.

The
FDA's fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening
diseases and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for these conditions. Under this program, the FDA can, for example, review portions of an NDA for a fast track product before
the entire application is complete, thus potentially beginning the review process at an earlier time.

We
cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant any of our requests for fast track designation, that any fast track designation would affect the time of review or that the FDA will approve
the NDA submitted for any of our drug candidates, whether or not fast track designation is granted. Additionally, FDA approval of a fast track product can include restrictions on the product's use or
distribution (such as permitting use only for specified medical conditions or limiting distribution to physicians or facilities with special training or experience). Approval of fast track products
can be conditioned on additional clinical trials after approval.

Sponsors
submit the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive manufacturing information and
proposed labeling. Upon receipt, the FDA initially reviews the NDA to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to initiate a substantive review. If the FDA identifies deficiencies that would
preclude substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the NDA and will inform the sponsor of the deficiencies that must be corrected prior to resubmission. If the FDA accepts the submission for
substantive review, the FDA typically reviews NDAs within an accepted time frame. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA agrees to



review
NDAs under either a standard review or priority review. FDA procedures provide for priority review of NDAs submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, offer a significant
improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. The FDA seeks to review NDAs that are granted priority status more quickly than NDAs given standard review status. The FDA's stated
policy is to act on 90% of priority NDAs within six months of receipt. Although the FDA historically has not met these goals, the agency has made significant improvements in the timeliness of the
review process. NDA review often extends significantly beyond anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional data or clarification, the FDA's decision to have an advisory committee
review and make recommendations on approval of the NDA, and difficulties in scheduling an advisory committee meeting. The recommendations of an advisory committee are not binding on the FDA.

To
obtain FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the patient population that will be treated. If regulatory approval of a
product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical trials. Marketing or promoting a
drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited. Furthermore, approval may entail ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, including
the need for patient and/or physician education, patient registries, medication or similar guides, or other restrictions on the distribution of the product. If an NDA does not satisfy applicable
regulatory criteria, the FDA may deny approval of an NDA or may issue a complete response, and require, among other things, additional clinical data or analyses.

Even
if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA.
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on this product, manufacturer or facility, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the
product from the market.

We
and any of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with applicable FDA current good manufacturing practice regulations. Good manufacturing practices include
requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as to corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the
applicable regulatory authorities. These facilities, whether our own or our contract manufacturers, must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our related products. We or
our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with applicable good manufacturing practices and FDA or other regulatory requirements. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply, we or
our contract manufacturers may be subject to legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, or voluntary recall of product. Furthermore, continued compliance with
applicable good manufacturing practices will require continual expenditure of time, money and effort on the part of us or our contract manufacturers in the areas of production and quality control and
record keeping and reporting, in order to ensure full compliance.

Outside
the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing
the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national
level, although within the European Union, or EU, registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. If the regulatory authority is
satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks
associated with FDA approval discussed above and may also include additional risks.

The
Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the
time of application for orphan drug designation. The first developer to receive FDA marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the United States
for the orphan drug indication.



However,
a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States
during the seven year exclusive marketing period. We believe that the commercial success of any orphan drug product that we may commercialize depends more significantly on the associated safety and
efficacy profile and on the price relative to competitive or alternative treatments and other marketing characteristics of the product than on the exclusivity afforded by the Orphan Drug Act.
Additionally, these products may be protected by patents and other means.

Legislation
similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United States, including the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies
addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons, are life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and for which no satisfactory treatment is authorized.
The market
exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product does not justify maintenance of
market exclusivity.

Marketing Exclusivity

The FDA may grant five years of exclusivity in the United States for the approval of NDAs for new chemical entities, and three years of
exclusivity for supplemental NDAs, for among other things, new indications, dosages or dosage forms of an existing drug if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant
are essential to the approval of the supplemental application. Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a
sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. The six month pediatric exclusivity is added to any existing patent
or non-patent exclusivity period for which the drug is eligible. Orphan drug products are also eligible for pediatric exclusivity if the FDA requests and the company completes pediatric
clinical trials.

Health Law Compliance

In addition to FDA laws and regulations, we must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare "fraud and
abuse" which govern, among other things, our relationships with healthcare providers, and the marketing and pricing of prescription drug products. Among these laws are anti-kickback laws
and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the
referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few
court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices could be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly
and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims
for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. In addition, a number of states require that companies implement compliance programs or comply
with industry ethics codes, adopt spending limits, and report to state governments any gifts, compensation, and other remuneration provided to physicians. The majority of states also have statutes or
regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states,
apply regardless of the payer. Many pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been investigated and prosecuted for alleged violations of these laws. Sanctions under these federal and state
laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), criminal fines, and imprisonment.
Companies that have chosen to
settle these alleged violations have typically paid multi-million dollar fines to the government and agreed to abide by corporate integrity agreements. Private individuals may bring similar actions.



There
are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to those states on certain pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain
ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the state
authorities.

Healthcare Reform

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability
Reconciliation Act, or collectively PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions
of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

•

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic

that we will qualify for this exemption.

Research and Development

Since our inception, we have made substantial investments in research and technology development. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
incurred research and development expenses of $123.9 million, $119.4 million and $146.4 million, respectively.

Human Resources

As of December 31, 2010, we had 247 employees, including 179 in research and development and 68 in operations support, finance
and administrative positions. Of these employees, 89 employees have advanced technical degrees including 10 MDs and 70 Ph.Ds. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and
management considers relations with our employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS

We are building our drug discovery, development and commercialization operations and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts.

We are building our drug discovery, development and commercialization operations. Our ability to discover, develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products will
depend on our ability to:

•

hire and retain key scientific employees;

•

identify high quality therapeutic targets;

•

identify potential drug candidates;

•

develop products internally or license drug candidates from others;

•

identify and enroll suitable human subjects, either in the United States or abroad, for our clinical trials;

•

complete laboratory testing and clinical trials on humans;

•

obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products;

•

obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our products, both in the United States and abroad;

•

enter into arrangements with third parties to provide services or to manufacture our products on our behalf;

•

deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions
in compliance with all applicable laws;

•

obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of our products from governmental authorities, private
health insurers and other third party payors;

•

lease facilities at reasonable rates to support our growth; and

•

enter into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products.

We
have limited experience with the activities listed above and may not be successful in discovering, developing, or commercializing drug products.

Our efforts to discover and develop potential drug candidates may not lead to the discovery, development, commercialization or marketing of drug products.

None of our drug candidates has, to date, been submitted for approval for sale in the United States or any foreign market. Discovery and development of potential
drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates that can be successfully developed and marketed. If our
efforts do not lead to the discovery of a suitable drug candidate, we may be unable to grow our clinical pipeline or we may be unable to enter into agreements with collaborators who are willing to
develop our drug candidates. Of the
compounds that we identify as potential drug products or that we in-license from other companies, only a few, if any, are likely to lead to successful drug development programs. For
example, in 2006, we discontinued the development of dexelvucitabine, or DFC, which was at the time our most advanced drug candidate and was in Phase IIb clinical trials. Prior to
discontinuation of the DFC program, we expended a significant amount of effort and money on that program. We have also licensed to other parties certain rights to our JAK and c-MET
inhibitor compounds and our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We have no or limited control over the further clinical development of these compounds.



The success of our drug discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully exploit our capabilities. If we are unable to
establish collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our compounds, our research, development and commercialization efforts may be
unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

An important element of our business strategy is to enter into collaborative or license arrangements with other parties, such as our collaborations with Novartis
and Lilly for our JAK inhibitors, under which we license our drug candidates to those parties for development and commercialization. We are evaluating strategic relationships with respect to several
of our other programs and may enter into an agreement with respect to one or more of these programs in the future. However, these arrangements and negotiations are complex and time consuming and there
can be no assurance that we will reach agreement with a collaborator or licensee with respect to any of these programs.

Because
collaboration and license arrangements are complex to negotiate, we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements. Also, we may not have drug compounds
that are desirable to other parties, or we may be unwilling to license a drug compound because the party interested in it is a competitor. The terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not
be favorable to us. Alternatively, potential collaborators may decide against entering into an agreement with us because of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or for
scientific, commercial or other reasons. If we are not able to establish collaborative or license arrangements, we may not be able to develop and commercialize a drug product, which would adversely
affect our business and our revenues.

In
order for any of these collaboration or license arrangements to be successful, we must first identify potential collaborators or licensees whose capabilities complement and integrate
well with ours. We may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources, but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials,
manufacturing, sales and marketing, and for licenses to technology rights. However, it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or
licensees devote to our programs or potential
products. If our collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are less skilled than we originally expected, do not devote adequate resources to the program, or do not agree with our
approach to development or manufacturing of the potential product, the relationship could be unsuccessful. If a business combination involving a collaborator or licensees and a third party were to
occur, the effect could be to diminish, terminate or cause delays in development of a potential product.

Conflicts may arise between our collaborators and licensees and us, or our collaborators and licensees may choose to terminate their agreements with us, which may adversely
affect our business.

Conflicts may arise with our collaborators and licensees if they pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in
collaboration with others as a means for developing treatments for the diseases that we have targeted. Competing products and product opportunities may lead our collaborators and licensees to withdraw
their support for our product candidates. Any failure of our collaborators and licensees to perform their obligations under our agreements with them could negatively impact the development of our
compounds and product candidates, lead to our loss of potential revenues from product sales and milestones and delay our achievement, if any, of profitability. Additionally, conflicts may arise if
there is a dispute about the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the course of a collaborative relationship.

Our
existing collaborative and license agreements can be terminated by our collaborators and licensees for convenience, among other circumstances. If any of our collaborators or
licensees terminates its agreement with us, or terminates its rights with respect to certain indications or compounds, we may not be able to find a new collaborator for them, and our business could be
adversely affected. Should an agreement be terminated before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration or license, our



reputation
could be harmed, we may not obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving, and our business could be adversely affected.

Although we obtained special protocol assessments for our JAK inhibitor for each of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, a special protocol assessment does not guarantee any
particular outcome from regulatory review, including any regulatory approval.

We have obtained a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for the registration trial for our JAK inhibitor for the treatment of myelofibrosis in the United States
and for the registration trial for our JAK inhibitor for the treatment of polycythemia vera in the United States. The SPA process allows for Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, evaluation of a
clinical trial protocol intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in support of a new drug application, or NDA, and provides a product sponsor with an agreement confirming that the
design and size of a trial will be appropriate to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim for an NDA if the trial is performed according to the SPA. Even
if we believe that the data from a clinical trial are supportive, an SPA is not a guarantee of approval, and we cannot be certain that the design of, or data collected from, a trial will be adequate
to demonstrate safety and efficacy, or otherwise be sufficient to support regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that the terms of an SPA will ultimately be binding on the FDA, and the FDA is
not obligated to approve an NDA, if any, even if the clinical outcome is positive. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA and the data and results from
a clinical trial, and can require trial design changes or additional studies if issues arise essential to determining safety or efficacy. Data may subsequently become available that causes the FDA to
reconsider the previously agreed upon scope of review and the FDA may have subsequent safety or efficacy concerns that override an SPA, and we can give no assurance that as clinical trials proceed or
as part of an NDA review process, if any, the FDA will determine that a previously approved SPA is still valid.

Additionally,
an SPA may be changed only with written agreement of the FDA and sponsor, and any further changes we may propose to the protocol will remain subject to the FDA's approval.
The FDA may not agree to any such amendment and, even if they agree, they may request other amendments to the trial design that could require additional cost and time, as well as increase the degree
of difficulty in reaching clinical endpoints. As a result, even with an SPA, we cannot be certain that the trial results will be found to be adequate to support an efficacy claim and product approval.

We depend heavily on the success of our most advanced product candidates. We might not be able to commercialize any of our drug candidates successfully, and we may spend
significant time and money attempting to do so.

We have invested significant resources in the development of our most advanced product candidates. Our drug candidate, ruxolitinib, is in Phase III
development for myelofibrosis and a Phase III clinical trial for polycythemia vera. We have a number of drug candidates in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Our ability to
generate product revenues will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our most advanced product candidates. We, or our collaborators or licensees, may decide to
discontinue development of any or all of our drug candidates at any time for commercial, scientific or other reasons. We discontinued development of DFC in April 2006 for safety reasons. In March
2008, we announced that we would not advance our lead CCR5 antagonist into Phase IIb trials and that we were seeking to out-license this program. If a product is developed, but is
not marketed, we may have spent significant amounts of time and money on it, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.



Even if a drug candidate that we develop receives regulatory approval, we may decide not to commercialize it if we determine that commercialization of that product would
require more money and time than we are willing to invest.

Even if any of our drug candidates receive regulatory approval, they would be subject to post-regulatory surveillance, and may have to be withdrawn
from the market or subject to restrictions if previously unknown problems occur. Regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing, and the drug product may be recalled or may
be subject to reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling, warnings to the public and negative publicity. As a result, we may not continue to commercialize a product even though it has
obtained regulatory approval. Further, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if the market does not accept the product because it is too expensive or because third parties such as
insurance companies or Medicare have not approved it for substantial reimbursement. In addition, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if another product comes on the market that is
as effective but has fewer side effects. There is also a risk that competitors may develop similar or superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our
products.

We have not commercialized a drug product to date. If we do not develop effective sales and marketing capabilities or establish third-party relationships for the
commercialization of our drug candidates, we will not be able to successfully commercialize any drug candidates that obtain regulatory approval, and we may incur significant additional costs or
difficulties in doing so.

We do not have experience selling or marketing drug products or with respect to pricing and obtaining adequate third-party reimbursement for drugs. We will need
to either develop sales and marketing capabilities or enter into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our drug candidates, if they are approved for sale by regulatory authorities. Under
our collaboration and license agreement with Novartis, we have retained commercialization rights to ruxolitinib in the United States. In anticipation of the regulatory approval of ruxolitinib for
myelofibrosis, we have started to build the sales and marketing, medical and operational infrastructure to support commercialization. This will require substantial efforts and significant management
and financial resources. We will need such an infrastructure to market any of our drug candidates for which we have retained commercialization rights, if they receive regulatory approval. We will need
to devote significant effort and investment, in particular, to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Competition for personnel with these skills
is very high, and we will be competing with companies that are currently marketing successful drugs. We may not be able to successfully develop our own sales and marketing capabilities for ruxolitinib
in the United States in order to support an effective launch of ruxolitinib if it is approved for sale. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis, we will have incurred
significant expenses to build this commercialization infrastructure.

We
have granted commercialization rights to other pharmaceutical companies with respect to certain of our drug candidates in specific geographic locations, and intend to seek other
collaborative or licensing arrangements with respect to other of our drug candidates. To the extent that our collaborators have commercial rights to our drug candidates, any revenues we receive from
any approved drugs will depend primarily on the sales and marketing efforts of others. We do not know whether we will be able to enter into additional third- party sales and marketing arrangements
with respect to any of our other
drug candidates on acceptable terms, if at all, or whether we will be able to leverage the sales and marketing capabilities we intend to build for ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis in order to market and
sell any other drug candidate if it is approved for sale.



If we fail to enter into additional licensing agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our business and operations might be adversely affected.

In addition to establishing collaborative or license arrangements under which other parties license our drug candidates for development and commercialization, we
may explore opportunities to develop our clinical pipeline by in-licensing drug compounds that fit within our expertise and research and development capabilities. We may be unable to enter
into any additional in-licensing agreements because suitable product candidates that are within our expertise may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us or because
competitors with greater resources seek to in-license the same product candidates. Product candidates that we would like to develop may not be available to us because they are controlled
by competitors who are unwilling to license the rights to the drug compound or candidate to us. In addition, we may enter into license agreements that are unsuccessful and our business and operations
might be adversely affected by the termination of a drug candidate and termination and winding down of the related license agreement. We may also need to license drug delivery or other technology in
order to continue to develop our drug candidate pipeline. If we are unable to enter into additional agreements to license drug candidates, drug delivery technology or other technology or if these
arrangements are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts could be adversely affected.

Any drug products that we bring to the market, even if they receive marketing approval, may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in
the medical community.

Even if we are successful in gaining regulatory approval of our products, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable if
these drug products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance. Physicians will not recommend our drug products until clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug
products as compared to other alternative treatments. Even if the clinical safety and efficacy of our drug products is established, physicians may elect not to prescribe these drug products for a
variety of reasons, including the reimbursement policies of government and other third-party payors and the effectiveness of our competitors in marketing their products.

Market
acceptance of our drug products, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:

•

the willingness and ability of patients and the healthcare community to use our products;

•

the ability to manufacture our drug products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and to offer our drug
products for sale at competitive prices;

•

the perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payors, regarding the safety, efficacy and
benefits of our drug products compared to those of competing products or therapies;

•

the label and promotional claims allowed by the FDA;

•

the pricing and reimbursement of our drug products relative to existing treatments; and

•

marketing and distribution support for our drug products.



We have limited expertise with and capacity to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials, and our resulting dependence on other parties could result in delays in and
additional costs for our drug development efforts.

We have limited experience with clinical trials, formulation, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. We also have
limited internal resources and capacity to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials. As part of our development strategy, we intend to hire clinical research organizations, or CROs, to perform
preclinical testing and clinical trials for drug candidates. If the CROs that we hire to perform our preclinical testing and clinical trials or our collaborators or licensees do not meet deadlines, do
not follow proper procedures, or a conflict arises between us and our CROs, our preclinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may be delayed or may be terminated. If we were
forced to find a replacement entity to perform any of our preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to
find another company to perform a preclinical test or clinical trial, the delay in the test or trial may result in significant additional expenditures. Events such as these may result in delays in our
obtaining regulatory approval for our drug candidates or our ability to
commercialize our products and could result in increased expenditures that would adversely affect our operating results.

In
addition, for some of our drug candidates, we have contracted with collaborators to advance those candidates through later-stage, more expensive clinical trials, rather than invest
our own resources to perform these clinical trials. Under the terms of our agreements with these collaborators, we have no or limited control over the conduct of these clinical trials, and in any
event we are subject to the risks associated with depending on collaborators to develop these drug candidates.

If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to develop and market products in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we will not be permitted to manufacture or
commercialize products resulting from our research.

In order to manufacture and commercialize drug products in the United States, our drug candidates will have to obtain regulatory
approval from the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years. To obtain regulatory approval, we must first show that our drug products
are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical testing (animal testing) and clinical trials (human testing). Preclinical testing and clinical development are long, expensive and
uncertain processes, and we do not know whether the FDA will allow us to undertake clinical trials of any potential drug products in addition to our compounds currently in clinical trials.

Completion
of clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of testing. The length of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity,
novelty and intended use of the product candidate. Interim results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early clinical trials may
not be repeated in later clinical trials. For example, a drug candidate that is successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or dangerous side effects when tested at the clinical level. Our
rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:

•

the high degree of risk associated with drug development;

•

our inability to formulate or manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;

•

variability in the number and types of patients available for each study;

•

difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;

•

unforeseen safety issues or side effects;



•

poor or unanticipated effectiveness of drug candidates during the clinical trials; or

•

government or regulatory delays.

Data
obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry,
including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, regulatory
authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of other factors, such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory agency review. For example, the FDA
has in the past required and could in the future require that we conduct additional trials of any of our product candidates, which would result in delays.

Due,
in part, to the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process, we cannot predict whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product we develop. None
of our drug candidates has, to date, been submitted for approval for sale in the United States of any foreign market. We have licensed to Novartis rights to ruxolitinib in certain indications outside
of the United States and worldwide rights to c-MET and licensed to Lilly worldwide rights to LY3009104. We have also licensed to Pfizer our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We have
no or limited control over the further clinical development of any compounds we licensed to these
collaborators. Compounds developed by us, alone or with other parties, may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed
to receive marketing approval. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through
clinical trials to be safe and effective. Failure to obtain regulatory approval would delay or prevent us from commercializing products.

Outside
the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. This foreign regulatory
approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above and may also include additional risks. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical
trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform additional testing and expend additional resources. Approval by the FDA does not
ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA.

We face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts, and if we do not compete effectively, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or
eliminated.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
Our drug discovery and development efforts may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing therapies or that are being developed by our competitors, many of which have
substantially greater resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, more experience in completing preclinical testing and clinical trials, and formulation, marketing and
manufacturing capabilities. As a result of these resources, our competitors may develop drug products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive by developing more effective drugs or by
developing their products more efficiently. Our ability to develop competitive products would be limited if our competitors succeeded in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly
than we were able to or in obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limited our drug development efforts. Any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts,
or from our joint efforts with collaborators or licensees, might not be able to compete successfully with our competitors' existing and future products, or obtain regulatory approval in the United
States or elsewhere.



Our reliance on other parties to manufacture our drug candidates could result in a short supply of the drugs, delays in clinical trials or drug development, increased costs,
and withdrawal or denial of a regulatory authority's approval.

We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our drug candidates. We currently rely on
third parties for the manufacture of both the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product of our drug candidates for clinical trials. In addition, we expect to continue to rely
on third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of API and finished drug product for any drugs that we successfully develop. For most of our drug candidates, including our lead drug
candidate ruxolitinib, we rely on one third party to manufacture the API, another to make finished drug product and a third to package and label the finished product. The FDA requires that the API and
finished product for each of our drug products be manufactured according to its current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations and regulatory authorities in other countries have similar
requirements. There are only a limited number of manufacturers that comply with these requirements. If the third parties that manufacture our drug candidates are not compliant with the applicable
regulatory requirements, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may require us to halt ongoing clinical trials or not approve our application to market our drug products. Failure to comply with
cGMP and the applicable regulatory requirements of other countries in the manufacture of our products could result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authority halting our clinical trials, withdrawing
or denying regulatory approval of our drug product, enforcing product recalls or other enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We
may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our drug candidates or any drug products we may develop if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or capability to
manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. In addition, we may not be able to arrange for our drug candidates or any drug products that we may develop to be manufactured by
one of these parties on reasonable terms, if at all. Also, raw materials that may be required to manufacture any products we develop may only be available from a limited number of suppliers.
Generally, we have only a single source that is qualified to supply the API and finished product of our drug candidates. If any of these single source suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to
supply us with API or finished product that complies with applicable regulatory requirements, we could incur significant delays in our clinical trials or interruption of commercial supply which could
have a material adverse effect on our business. We are currently seeking to qualify a second source of supply for the API for our lead drug candidate, ruxolitinib, however, there is no assurance that
we will be able to identify and qualify a second source of supply for ruxolitinib or any of our other drug candidates or drug products on a timely basis. If we have promised delivery of a new product
and are unable to meet the delivery requirement due to manufacturing difficulties, our development programs would be delayed, and we may have to expend additional sums in order to ensure that
manufacturing capacity is available when we need it even if we do not use all of the manufacturing capacity. This expense would adversely affect our operating results.

Manufacturers
of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, especially in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production
costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations.

In
order to obtain approval of our products, including ruxolitinib, by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, we need to complete testing on both the API and on the finished product in
the packaging we propose for commercial sales. This includes testing of stability, identification of impurities and testing of other product specifications by validated test methods. In addition, we
will be required to consistently produce the API in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis and document our ability to do so. This requirement is referred to as process
validation. With respect to ruxolitinib, although we have manufactured the product at commercial scale, we have started, but not yet completed, this



process
validation requirement. If the required testing or process validation is delayed or produces unfavorable results, we may not obtain approval to launch the product or product launch may be
delayed.

We
may not be able to adequately manage and oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. Foreign manufacturing
approval processes typically include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process for manufacturing and may also include additional risks.

If we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of
business.

Our activities, and the activities of our collaborators, partners and third party providers, are subject to extensive government
regulation and oversight both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many of our most critical business activities,
including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. States
increasingly have been placing greater restrictions on the marketing practices of healthcare companies. In addition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and
investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical
products, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state healthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations, or violations related to
environmental matters. Violations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in
government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or pay
additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into
alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.

Health care reform measures could impact the pricing and profitability of pharmaceuticals, and adversely affect the commercial viability of our drug candidates. Our ability
to generate revenues will be diminished if we are unable to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement from private insurers, government insurance programs or other third-party payors of health care
costs, which could be affected by recent healthcare reform legislation.

Our ability to commercialize our drug candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which adequate reimbursement levels
for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained from third-party payors, such as private insurers, government insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) and other health care related organizations. The continuing efforts of these third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged for
medical products and services may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers, collaborators and licensees and the
availability of capital.

In
recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. Comprehensive
reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were recently enacted, including changes to the methods for, and amounts of, Medicare reimbursement. These reforms could significantly reduce payments from
Medicare and Medicaid. Reforms or other changes to these payment systems, may change the availability, methods and rates of reimbursements from Medicare, private insurers and other third-party payors
for our drug candidates. Some of these changes and proposed changes could result in reduced reimbursement rates, which could reduce the price that we or any of our collaborators or licensees receive
for any products, if



commercialized,
in the future, and which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. Further federal and state proposals and health care reforms are possible, which
could limit the prices that can be charged for any of our drug candidates and may further limit the commercial viability of our drug candidates. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of
prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. If reimbursement for our products, if commercialized, is unavailable, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory
levels, our business could be materially harmed. There may be future changes that result in reductions in current coverage and reimbursement levels for our drug candidates, and we cannot predict the
scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on our operations.

Third-party
payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States and the concurrent
growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce
government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products. Adoption of our drug candidates by the medical community may be limited without adequate reimbursement
for our products. Cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for our drug candidates
and, in turn, the price that we will be able to charge for any product, if commercialized. Our drug candidates may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not
be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. We are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private
or government payors to our drug candidates.

The
cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and any denial of private or government payor coverage or inadequate reimbursement for our drug
candidates could materially and adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results.

As our drug discovery and development operations are conducted at our headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the loss of access to this facility would negatively impact our
business.

Our facility in Wilmington, Delaware is our headquarters and is also where we conduct all of our drug discovery operations and research
and development activities. Our lease contains provisions that provide for its early termination upon the occurrence of certain events of default or upon a change of control. Further, our headquarters
facility is located in a large research and development complex that may be temporarily or permanently shutdown if certain environmental or other hazardous conditions were to occur within the complex.
In addition, actions of activists opposed to aspects of pharmaceutical research may disrupt our experiments or our ability to access or use our facilities. The loss of access to or use of our
Wilmington, Delaware, facility, either on a temporary or permanent basis, or early termination of our lease would result in an interruption of our business and, consequently, would adversely affect
the advancement of our drug discovery and development programs and our overall business.

We depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel, and the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain
additional personnel would affect our ability to expand our drug discovery and development programs and achieve our objectives.

We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management, operations and scientific staff. We experience intense competition
for qualified personnel. Our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team, key scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit, train
and retain essential personnel for our drug discovery and development programs, including those who will be responsible for overseeing our preclinical testing and clinical trials, for the
establishment of collaborations with other companies and for our marketing, medical, and operational infrastructure to support commercialization marketing efforts. If we lose the services of any of
these people or if we are unable to recruit sufficient qualified personnel, our research and product development goals, including the identification and establishment of key collaborations, operations
and



marketing
efforts could be delayed or curtailed. We do not maintain "key person" insurance on any of our employees.

If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our ability to develop and commercialize products could suffer.

We expect that if our clinical drug candidates continue to progress in development, we continue to build our development, medical and
marketing organizations and our drug discovery efforts continue to generate drug candidates, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management and resources. Our ability to
commercialize our drug candidates and to achieve our research and development objectives depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization, systems
and controls to accommodate additional anticipated growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business could be harmed and our ability to execute our business strategy could
suffer.

If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products and our results of
operations could be harmed.

The clinical trials and marketing of medical products that are intended for human use entails an inherent risk of product liability. If
any product that we or any of our
collaborators or licensees develops causes or is alleged to cause injury or is found to be unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing or sale, we may be held liable. If we cannot successfully
defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities, including substantial damages to be paid to the plaintiffs and legal costs, or we may be required to limit
commercialization of our products. Our product liability insurance policy that provides coverage for liabilities arising from our clinical trials may not fully cover our potential liabilities. In
addition, we may determine that we should increase our coverage upon the undertaking of new clinical trials, and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our collaborators or licensees
and may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could
prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with our collaborators. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation,
recall of products, participants to withdraw from clinical trials, and potential collaborators or licensees to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.

Because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials, we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials that could
be time consuming and costly.

We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, handling,
storage and disposal of regulated substances and the health and safety of our employees. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and
biological waste resulting in the production of hazardous waste products. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these
materials. If any injury or contamination results from our use or the use by our collaborators or licensees of these materials, we may be sued and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and
our total assets. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators or licensees against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in
connection with these collaborations or licenses. Compliance with the applicable environmental and workplace laws and regulations is expensive. Future changes to environmental, health, workplace and
safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or may restrict our operations or impair our research, development and production efforts.



RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

We expect to incur losses in the future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

We had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through 2010. Because of those losses, we had an accumulated deficit
of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. We will continue to spend significant amounts on our efforts to discover and develop drugs. As a result, we expect to continue to incur losses in
2011 and in future periods as well.

We
anticipate that our drug discovery and development efforts and related expenditures will increase as we focus on the studies, including preclinical tests and clinical trials prior to
seeking regulatory approval, that are required before we can sell a drug product.

The
development of drug products will require us to spend significant funds on research, development, testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and marketing. To date, we do
not have any drug products that have generated revenues and we cannot assure you that we will generate revenues from the drug candidates that we license or develop for several years, if ever.

We
cannot be certain whether or when we will achieve profitability because of the significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate commercially successful drug products.
Even if we were successful in obtaining regulatory approvals for manufacturing and commercializing a drug candidate, we expect that we will continue to incur losses if our drug products do not
generate significant revenues. If we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.

We will need additional capital in the future. The capital markets may not permit us to raise additional capital at the time that we require it, which could result in
limitations on our research and development or commercialization efforts or the loss of certain of our rights in our technologies or drug candidates.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our
business plan and research and development efforts going-forward and to repay our indebtedness.

Additional
factors that may affect our future funding requirements include:

•

any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs;

•

the results of research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trials conducted by us or our future
collaborators or licensees, if any;

•

our exercise of any co-development options with collaborators that may require us to fund future development;

•

the acquisition of technologies, if any;

•

our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations;

•

competing technological and market developments;

•

the amount of revenues generated from our business activities, if any;

•

the time and costs involved in filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims;

•

the receipt of contingent licensing or milestone fees or royalties on product sales from our current or future
collaborative and license arrangements, if established; and

•

the timing of regulatory approvals, if any.

If
we require additional capital at a time when investment in companies such as ours, or in the marketplace generally, is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions,
we may have to



scale
back our operations, eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborator or licensee that would result in
terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates. If we are unable to raise funds at the time that we desire or at any time
thereafter on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to develop our potential drug products. The sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our
stockholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.

We have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.

As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate principal amount of our total consolidated debt was $420.0 million and our
stockholders' deficit was $88.6 million. Our substantial
leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital and research and development
expenditures, and general corporate purposes;

•

requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and research and development expenditures;

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete;
or

•

placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better
access to capital resources.

We
may not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges, including our obligations with respect to our outstanding
convertible senior notes. As of December 31, 2010, $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the non-interest bearing convertible subordinated notes held by Pfizer was
outstanding, of which $10.0 million is due in 2013 and $10.0 million is due in 2014. As of December 31, 2010, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75%
convertible senior notes due 2015 was outstanding and due in October 2015. Annual interest payments for our 4.75% convertible senior notes through 2015, assuming that none of these notes are
converted, repurchased or exchanged, are $19.0 million. Funds sufficient to pay interest payments through October 2012 on our 4.75% convertible senior notes are held in an escrow account as
security for these interest payments. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or raise additional cash through financings sufficient to meet the remaining obligations under our 4.75%
convertible senior notes or under our notes held by Pfizer, we will need to use existing cash or liquidate marketable securities in order to fund these obligations, which may delay or curtail our
research, development and commercialization programs.

The
indenture governing our 4.75% convertible senior notes includes limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue certain preferred stock, and incur liens on our
assets, including on intellectual property concerning our JAK inhibitor program. These limitations could interfere with our ability to raise additional capital in the future or engage in activities
that may be in our long-term best interest.



Our marketable securities are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our overall financial position.

We invest our cash in accordance with an established internal policy and customarily in instruments and money market funds which
historically have been highly liquid and carried relatively low risk. However, with recent credit market conditions, similar types of investments and money market funds have experienced losses in
value or liquidity issues which differ from their historical pattern.

Should
a portion of our cash or marketable securities lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it could adversely affect our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to
fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise. Such financing, if available, may not be available on commercially attractive terms.

Our current revenues are derived from collaborations and from licensing our intellectual property. If we are unable to achieve milestones, develop products or renew or enter
into new collaborations, our revenues may decrease, and future milestone and royalty payments may not contribute significantly to revenues for several years, and may never result in revenues.

We derived all of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 from our collaborations and licensing our intellectual
property to others. Future revenues from research and development collaborations depend upon continuation of the collaborations, the achievement of milestones and royalties we earn from any future
products developed from our research. If we are unable to successfully achieve milestones or our collaborators fail to develop successful products, we will not earn the future revenues contemplated
under our collaborative agreements.

RISKS RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LEGAL MATTERS

If we are subject to arbitration, litigation and infringement claims, they could be costly and disrupt our drug discovery and development efforts.

The technology that we use to make and develop our drug products, the technology that we incorporate in our products, and the products
we are developing may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others. The success of our drug discovery and development efforts will also depend on our ability to
develop new compounds, drugs and technologies without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. We are aware of patents and patent applications filed in certain countries
claiming intellectual property relating to some of our drug discovery targets and product candidates. While the validity of issued patents, patentability of pending patent applications and
applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain, if any of these patents are asserted against us or if we choose to license any of these patents, our ability to commercialize our products
could be harmed or the potential return to us from any product that may be successfully commercialized could be diminished.

From
time to time we have received, and we may in the future receive, notices from third parties offering licenses to technology or alleging patent, trademark, or copyright infringement,
claims regarding trade secrets or other contract claims. Receipt of these notices could result in significant costs as a result of the diversion of the attention of management from our drug discovery
and development efforts. Parties sending these notices may have brought and in the future may bring litigation against us or seek arbitration relating to contract claims.

We
may be involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights or contract violations. In addition, litigation or
other legal proceedings may be necessary to:

•

assert claims of infringement;

•

enforce our patents or trademarks;



•

protect our trade secrets or know-how; or

•

determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.

We
may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings. Regardless of the outcome, litigation or other legal proceedings can be very costly and
can divert management's efforts. For example, we settled patent litigation with Invitrogen Corporation in 2006. We incurred significant expenses related to this litigation and, as part of the
settlement, paid Invitrogen $3.4 million. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us or our collaborators or licensees to seek licenses to other parties'
patents or proprietary rights. We or our collaborators or licensees may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling a drug or other product that we or they develop. Further, we or
our future collaborators or licensees may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license
technology on a timely basis or on reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.

We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary information, which may result in its unauthorized use, a loss of revenue under a collaboration agreement or
loss of sales to generic versions of our products or otherwise reduce our ability to compete in developing and commercializing products.

Our business and competitive position depends in significant part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including any
drug products that we create. Despite our efforts to protect this information, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. For example, one of our
collaborators may disclose proprietary information pertaining to our drug discovery efforts. In addition, while we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to our product candidates in the
United States and in foreign countries, our patent applications may fail to result in issued patents. In addition, because patent applications can take several years to issue as patents, there may be
pending patent applications of others that may later issue as patents that cover some aspect of our drug candidates. Our existing patents and any future
patents we may obtain may not be broad enough to protect our products or all of the potential uses of our products, or otherwise prevent others from developing competing products or technologies. In
addition, our patents may be challenged and invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages if, for example, others were first to invent or first to file a patent
application for the technologies and products covered by our patents.

Additionally,
when we do not control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain important intellectual property, such as a drug compound in-licensed to us or
subject to a collaboration with a third party, the protection of the intellectual property rights may not be in our hands. If we do not control the intellectual property rights in-licensed
to us with respect to a compound and the entity that controls the intellectual property rights does not adequately protect those rights, our rights may be impaired, which may impact our ability to
develop, market and commercialize the in-licensed compound.

Our
means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may:

•

independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, products and techniques;

•

otherwise gain access to our proprietary information; or

•

design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property.

We
pursue a policy of having our employees, consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us. However, these agreements
may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. If we fail to maintain trade secret and patent protection,
our potential, future revenues may be decreased.



If the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the United States patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications, the value of our
patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased.

The value of our patents depends in part on their duration. A shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights
under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents. The United States patent laws were amended in 1995 to change the term of patent protection from
17 years from patent issuance to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the application. Because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications may be more
than three years depending on the subject matter, a 20-year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection.

International patent protection is particularly uncertain and costly, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries, we may have to expend
substantial sums and management resources.

Biotechnology and pharmaceutical patent law outside the United States is even more uncertain and costly than in the United States and
is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws.
For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the treatment of humans. We may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or
our competitors' foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters is in Wilmington, Delaware, which is where our drug discovery and development operations are also located.
As of December 31, 2010, we had a lease agreement covering approximately 110,245 square feet that expires in June 2013. We believe that these facilities are adequate to meet our business
requirements for the near-term and that additional space will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if required. In addition to our corporate headquarter lease, we had a lease
agreement for 96,025 square feet as of December 31, 2010 for a facility that was closed as a part of the restructuring of our genomic information business in Palo Alto, California. This lease
agreement expires in March 2011 and all of this space is currently subleased to others.

We
anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and development programs. We also expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter
and that such fluctuations may be substantial. Conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates in development is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. If we are unable to
successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted.

License Agreements

Novartis

In November 2009, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis
received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including
all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. We retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib in the United States and in certain other
indications. Novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c-MET inhibitor compound INCB28060 and certain back-up compounds in all
indications. We retained options to co-develop and to co-promote INCB28060 in the United States.



Under
this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to
approximately $1.1 billion if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved. In 2010, we received $50 million in milestone payments for the initiation of the global
Phase III trial, RESPONSE, in patients with polycythemia vera. We also could receive tiered, double digit royalties on future ruxolitinib sales
outside of the United States. Each company is responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of the JAK inhibitor compound in its respective territories, with costs of
collaborative studies shared equally. Novartis is responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the c-MET inhibitor compound after the initial
Phase I clinical trial.

The
Novartis agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until Novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier,
the termination of the agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis
by Novartis for convenience. The agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

Lilly

In December 2009, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company. Under the terms of
the agreement, Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to LY3009104 and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We received
an initial payment of $90 million, and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to $665 million based on the achievement of defined development, regulatory and
commercialization milestones. In 2010, we received $49 million in milestone payments from Lilly. We also could receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global sales with rates
ranging up to 20% if the product is successfully commercialized.

We
retained options to co-develop our JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors with Lilly on a compound-by-compound and indication-by-indication
basis. Lilly will be responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the compounds unless we elect to co-develop any compounds or indications. If we elect to
co-develop any compounds and/or indications, we would be responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs from the initiation of a Phase IIb trial. We
would receive an incremental royalty rate increase across all tiers resulting in effective royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties on potential future global sales for compounds and/or
indications that we elect to co-develop. We also retained an option to co-promote products in the United States. In July 2010, we elected to co-develop LY3009104
with Lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of a Phase IIb trial through
regulatory approval. The Lilly agreement will continue until Lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms. The
agreement may be terminated by Lilly for convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

Pfizer

In January 2006, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the pursuit of our CCR2
antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications,
with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on pre-clinical
development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement. Prior to such
expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. In addition, Pfizer may terminate the
agreement at any time



upon
90 days' notice. We received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006 and are eligible to receive additional future development
and milestone payments. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007 and a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2010.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements:

•

Revenue recognition;

•

Research and development costs;

•

Stock compensation;

•

Investments; and

•

Convertible debt and derivative accounting.

Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered,
the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. We exercise judgment in
determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment
terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the
creditworthiness of the customer.

Under
agreements involving multiple deliverables, services and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met,
including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When separate units of
accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from
historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. If such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is
deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. When elements are specifically tied to a separate
earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. When revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings
process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. All milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

Revenues
from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements. Royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or
services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee. We
exercise judgment in



determining
whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon.

Research and Development Costs.

Our policy is to expense research and development costs as incurred. We often contract with
clinical research
organizations (CROs) to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we record monthly
accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.

These
CRO contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event
that we prepay CRO fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development
services are performed. Most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. These
professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date. Our CRO contracts generally include pass through fees. Pass through fees include, but are not limited to,
regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous costs, including shipping and printing fees. We expense the costs of pass through fees under our CRO contracts as they are
incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. The estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored
through correspondence with the CROs, internal reviews and a review of contractual terms. The factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical
trial, estimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the dosing regimen. CRO fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period. Reimbursable costs incurred in
connection with collaborative license agreements are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses.

Stock Compensation.

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting guidance for stock compensation requires all
share-based payment
transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their fair values. The accounting guidance
also requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option
forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation and requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations. We
recorded $14.9 million, $10.0 million and $15.0 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Investments.

We carry our investments at their respective fair values. We periodically evaluate the fair values of our
investments to determine
whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other-than-temporary impairment. This evaluation consists of a review of several factors, including the
length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position, the existence of an event that would impair the issuer's future repayment potential, the near term prospects for
recovery of the market value of a security and if we intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If
management determines that such an impairment exists, we would recognize an impairment charge. Because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short-term
investment or marketable security prior to maturity, we classify our short-term investments and marketable securities as "available-for-sale." Investments in
securities that are classified as available-for-sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets, and unrealized holding
gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized. We classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one
year as short-term investments. Those marketable



securities
in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as
long-term marketable securities.

Convertible Debt and Derivative Accounting.

We perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine
if (1) such
features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for, and (2) if bifurcation requirements are met, whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liabilities.
If the embedded feature meets the requirements to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability, the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially, included as a liability on the
consolidated balance sheet, and remeasured each reporting period. Any changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. We monitor, on an ongoing basis, whether events or
circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009

We recorded net losses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $31.8 million and $211.9 million,
respectively. On a basic and diluted per share basis, net loss was $0.26 and $2.06 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Our
contract revenues were $169.0 million and $5.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, contract revenues were
derived from the straight line recognition of revenue associated with the Novartis and Lilly upfront fees over the estimated performance periods. The upfront fees related to the Novartis agreement
included a $150.0 million upfront payment received in 2009, a $60.0 million immediate milestone payment received in 2010 and $10.9 million of reimbursable costs incurred prior to
the effective date of the agreement. The upfront fees related to the Lilly agreement consisted of a $90.0 million upfront payment received in 2010. The increase from 2009 to 2010 primarily
relates to 2010 amortization of the upfront fee received from Novartis and Lilly under our collaboration and license agreements. In addition, in 2010 we received and recognized a total of
$102.0 million in milestone payments from Novartis, Lilly and Pfizer.

We currently track research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. Salary and benefits related expense increased from 2009 to
2010 due to increased development headcount to sustain our development pipeline. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted, stock price
volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. The decrease in clinical research and outside services expense from
2009 to 2010 was primarily the result of decreased development costs due to our shared costs arrangements with our collaborators. Research and development expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009 were net of $9.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by our collaborative partners. The increase in occupancy and all other
costs from 2009 to 2010 was primarily the result of increased laboratory expenses. Research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects
and the level of pre-clinical and clinical trial-related activities. Many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including requests by regulatory agencies for more
information, inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among patients, insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or
perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials. In addition, the development of all of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation.
These factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products.

In
July 2010, we elected to co-develop LY3009104 with Lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs
for this indication from the initiation of a Phase IIb trial through regulatory approval. We have retained certain mechanisms to give us cost protection as LY3009104 advances in clinical
development. We can defer our portion of co-development study costs by indication if they exceed a predetermined level. This deferment would be credited against future milestones or
royalties and we would still be eligible for the full incremental royalties related to the co-development option. In addition, even if we have started co-development funding
for any indication, we can at any time opt out for that indication and stop future co-development cost sharing. If we elect to do this we would still be eligible for our base royalties
plus an incremental pro-rated royalty commensurate with our contribution to the total co-development cost for those indications for which we contributed funding.

Salary
and benefits related expense increased from 2009 to 2010 due to increased headcount. This increased headcount was due to preparation for the potential commercialization of
ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted, stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as
expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. The increase in other contract services and outside costs was primarily the result of initial marketing preparations
for the potential commercialization of ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis.

Other expenses.

Other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $(0.4) million and $2.0 million,
respectively. In
2010, we recorded $0.2 million of expense in connection with our 2004



restructuring
program and $(0.6) million of expense (benefit) in connection with our 2002 restructuring program. In 2009, we recorded $0.4 million of expense in connection with our 2004
restructuring program and $1.6 million of expense in connection with our 2002 restructuring program.

Other income (expense)

Interest and other income, net.

Interest and other income, net, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was
$1.4 million and
$0.1 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 from 2009 is primarily due to the Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project grants received in October 2010, for which we were awarded
$0.7 million in connection with our development programs.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $43.3 million and $32.1 million,
respectively. The increase in 2010 from 2009 is primarily attributable to the increase in coupon interest and accretion of the discount related to our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 issued in
September 2009.

Loss on embedded derivative liability.

The loss on embedded derivative liability related to the conversion feature on our 4.75%
convertible senior
notes due 2015 which was originally valued on September 30, 2009 at $148.1 million. On November 24, 2009, we increased the number of shares of our common stock authorized for
issuance in an amount sufficient to satisfy conversion of our 4.75% convertible senior notes, and we recorded a mark-to-market adjustment in the value of the embedded
derivative liability to $182.4 million as, among other factors, our stock price increased from September 30, 2009, which resulted in a $34.3 million non-cash charge.
As a result of the increase in our common stock authorized for issuance, classification of this embedded derivative as a liability is no longer required, and we have reclassified it to
additional-paid-in-capital.

Loss on repurchase of convertible senior and subordinated notes.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we redeemed the
remaining
$55.6 million principal amount of our 3


/


% convertible senior notes due 2011 and $119.0 million principal amount of our 3

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $32.1 million and $24.9 million,

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure guidance for revenue recognition. These amendments,
effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (early adoption is permitted), modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what
constitutes a non-software deliverable. The impact of the adoption of these amendments will depend on the nature of the arrangements that we enter into subsequent to the date we adopt the
amendments.

In
January 2010, an amendment to the FASB fair value guidance was issued. This amendment requires disclosures of transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2, more detailed roll
forward reconciliations of Level 3 recurring fair value measurements on a gross basis, fair value information by class of assets and liabilities, and descriptions of valuation techniques and
inputs for Level 2 and 3 measurements. We adopted the amendment during the first quarter of 2010, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements as this change is
disclosure-only in nature.



In
April 2010, the FASB issued guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or
development transactions. Research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon milestone events such as
successful completion of phases in a study or achieving a specific result from the research or development efforts. The amendments provide guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining
whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with
early adoption permitted. We do not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.

Sources and Uses of Cash.

We had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through 2010. Because of those losses, we
had an
accumulated deficit of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. We have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities, the issuance of convertible notes,
cash received from customers, and collaborative arrangements. At December 31, 2010, we had available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $424.2 million, excluding a
funded restricted cash escrow account of $37.9 million reserved for interest payments through October 2012 on our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2015. Our cash and marketable securities
balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts and U.S. government agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. Available cash is
invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments. Recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse
impact on financial market activities including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain
investments and declining valuations of others. We have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there had not been a significant impact to our financial
position, results of operations or liquidity during 2010.

Cash provided by (used in) Operating Activities.

The $85.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2009 to
2010 was due
primarily to remaining upfront payments of $150.0 million and milestone payments of $102.0 million received from our collaborators during 2010. The $153.2 million increase in cash
provided by operating activities from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to the impact of the upfront payment received in 2009 related to our collaboration and license agreement with Novartis.

Cash provided by Investing Activities.

Our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities,
have consisted
predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long-term investments. In the future, net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to
period due to the timing of strategic equity investments, acquisitions, including



possible
earn-out payments to former Maxia stockholders, capital expenditures and maturities/sales and purchases of marketable securities.

Cash provided by (used in) Financing Activities.

During 2010, net cash used in financing activities was $145.1 million, which
represented
primarily $158.6 million used to redeem the remaining 3


/


% convertible senior notes due 2011 and 3


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2011, offset by proceeds
of
$13.6 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan. During 2009, we received net proceeds of $132.3 million from the issuance of
common stock in a public offering and net proceeds of $387.4 million from the issuance of our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 in a private placement. We also used $223.3 million
to repurchase $227.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 3


/


% convertible senior notes due 2011 and 3


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2011. In 2009,
we also funded an escrow account of $56.2 million for the first six semi-annual interest payments on our 4.75% convertible senior notes. In addition, in 2009 we received
$2.1 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan. During 2008, we received net proceeds of $101.7 million from the issuance
of common stock. In addition, in 2008 we received $3.2 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan.

The
following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in
future periods (in millions):

The
amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations. We have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space
with scheduled payments to us of $0.4 million (less than 1 year), which are not reflected in the above table. In addition, we have funded an escrow account of $37.9 million as of
December 31, 2010 reserved for interest payments through October 2012 on our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2015.

The
table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events. The most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations
are summarized below.

Commitments
related to Maxia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable. In February
2003, we completed our acquisition of Maxia. Under the merger agreement, former Maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of
$14.0 million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement. Twenty percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will be paid in cash and
the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million in our common stock (based upon the then fair
value) could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones. The milestones are set to occur as Maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time
prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger. In any event, no more than 13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to former Maxia stockholders



in
the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement. None of these milestones has been achieved as of December 31, 2010.

We
have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these
licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products.

We
believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our cash requirements depend on
numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal
proceedings; competing technological and market developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; our receipt of any
milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into, including the agreements with Novartis, Lilly and Pfizer; and expenditures in connection with strategic relationships
and license agreements. Changes in our research and development or commercialization plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of
expenditures of our capital resources. We expect that future revenues generated from information products, including licensing of intellectual property, will continue to decline as we focus on drug
discovery and development programs and, in 2011, will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us.

Until
we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or
private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations. The sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and
may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could
restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness. The indenture under which our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 are issued contains a covenant that, among other things,
limits our ability and the ability of any of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, or sell, lease, license, transfer or
otherwise dispose of certain of our or their assets. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The credit markets and the financial services industry
recently experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of
intervention from the United States federal government. These events generally made equity and debt financing difficult to obtain since their occurrence. If we are not able to secure additional
funding when needed, we may have to scale back our operations, delay or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a
collaborator or licensee that would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed above.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our investments in marketable securities, which are composed primarily of U.S. government agency and non-agency
mortgage-backed securities and money market funds, are subject to default, changes in credit rating and changes in market value. These investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will
decrease in value if market rate interest rates increase. As of December 31, 2010, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were
$424.2 million, excluding a funded restricted cash escrow account of $37.9 million reserved for interest payments through October 2012 on our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2015. Due
to the nature of these investments, if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of December 31, 2010, the decline in fair value would not be
material.

Interim Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited)




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Incyte Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Incyte Corporation, at December 31,
2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Incyte Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Business.

Incyte Corporation ("Incyte," "we," "us," or "our") is a drug discovery and development company focused on
developing
proprietary small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline with programs focused primarily in the areas of oncology and inflammation.

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Incyte Corporation and our wholly owned
subsidiaries. All
material inter-company accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of Credit Risk.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade receivables are financial instruments which
potentially
subject us to concentrations of credit risk. The estimated fair value of financial instruments approximates the carrying value based on available market information. We primarily invest our excess
available funds in notes and bills issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and corporate debt securities and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and to any one
type of investment, other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Our receivables mainly relate to our collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies. We have not
experienced any significant credit losses on cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities or trade receivables to date and do not require collateral on receivables.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. banks or in custodial accounts with U.S. banks. Cash equivalents
are defined as
all liquid investments and money market funds with maturity from date of purchase of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash and have insignificant interest rate risk.

Marketable Securities—Available-for-Sale.

All marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices and observable inputs, with unrealized gains
and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity (deficit). We classify marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on the consolidated
balance sheets. Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six
months and (ii) we have the ability to hold them until the carrying value is recovered and such holding period may be longer than one year. The amortized cost of debt securities in this
category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses and declines in
value judged to be other than temporary for available-for-sale securities are included in "Interest and other income, net." The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method.

Accounts Receivable.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an allowance for
doubtful accounts
based on experience and specifically identified risks. Accounts receivable are carried at fair value and charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is
unlikely and we cease collection efforts.



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
recorded using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (generally three to five years). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the assets or lease term.

Management
continually reviews the estimated useful lives of technologically sensitive equipment and believes that those estimates appropriately reflect the current useful life of our
assets. In the event that a currently unknown significantly advanced technology became commercially available, we would re-evaluate the value and estimated useful lives of our existing
equipment, possibly having a material impact on the financial statements.

Intangible and Other Assets.

Patent application costs relating to ongoing drug discovery and development are charged to expense as
incurred.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income taxes are provided at the currently enacted income tax rates for the difference between the financial
statement and
income tax basis of assets and liabilities and carry-forward items. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various
tax audits and issues. In addition, valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets where the amount of expected future taxable income from operations does not support the realization of
the asset. We believe that the current assumptions
and other considerations used to estimate the current year effective and deferred tax positions are appropriate. However, if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates
and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Financing Costs Related to Long-term Debt.

Costs associated with obtaining long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the
term of the related debt using the effective interest method. Such costs are included in intangibles and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share.

Our basic and diluted losses per share are calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average
number of shares
of common stock outstanding during all periods presented. Options to purchase stock and convertible debt are included in diluted earnings per share calculations, unless the effects are
anti-dilutive.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the following:

Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered,
the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. We exercise judgment in
determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

been
delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject
to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.

Under
agreements involving multiple deliverables, services and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met,
including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When separate units of
accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from
historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. If such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is
deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. When elements are specifically tied to a separate
earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. When revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings
process, they are recognized
ratably over the term of the agreement. All milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

Revenues
from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements. Royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or
services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee. We
exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon.

In
connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. ("Novartis"), we received an upfront non-refundable
payment of $150.0 million in December 2009. Included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2009 was $60.0 million due from Novartis for a
milestone that was achieved in 2009 prior to the execution of the collaboration. Accordingly, this milestone was not deemed substantive. The total amount of $210.0 million was recorded as
deferred revenue and is being recognized on a straight-line basis through December 2013, our estimated performance period under the agreement. In connection with our collaborative research
and license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company ("Lilly") executed in 2009, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $90.0 million in January 2010. The $90.0 million
upfront fee was included in accounts receivable, was recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2009 and will be recognized on a straight-line
basis through December 2016, our estimated performance period under the agreement. In connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer"), we received
an upfront non-refundable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006. The $40.0 million upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized on a
straight-line basis over two years, our estimated performance period under the agreement. In February 2006 and October 2007, Pfizer purchased, for a total of $20.0 million, a
convertible subordinated note due 2013 and a convertible subordinated note due 2014 (collectively, the "Pfizer Notes"). As the Pfizer Notes are non-interest bearing, they have been
discounted to their net present value. The difference between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes, plus the related beneficial conversion feature, totals $3.2 million
for each note, which represented additional consideration from Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and have recognized

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

it
over our estimated performance period under the agreement. Payments for all milestones that are deemed to be substantive milestones will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the
associated milestone.

Research and Development.

It is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred. We often contract with clinical
research
organizations ("CROs") to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that research and development costs
are expensed as incurred, we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.

These
CRO contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event
that we prepay CRO fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development
services are performed. Most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. These
professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date.

Our
CRO contracts generally include pass through fees. Pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous
costs, including shipping and printing fees. We expense the costs of pass through fees under our CRO contracts as they are incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. The
estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the CROs, internal reviews and a review of
contractual terms. The factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical trial, estimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the
dosing regimen. CRO fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.

Other expenses.

We recognize other expenses in connection with our plans to exit certain activities including costs related to leased
facilities to
be abandoned or subleased, and other exit-related costs pursuant to formal plans developed by management. The recognition of other expenses requires our management to make judgments and
estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity, including estimating sublease income and the fair value, less sales costs, of equipment to be
disposed of. Management's estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each
reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that they are adequate, that no excess accruals are retained, and that the utilization of the provisions are for their intended
purposes in accordance with developed exit plans.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") accounting guidance for stock compensation requires all
share-based payment
transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their fair values. The accounting guidance
also requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option
forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation and requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations. We recorded



INCYTE CORPORATION

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

$14.9 million,
$10.0 million and $15.0 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure guidance for
revenue recognition. These amendments, effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (early adoption is permitted), modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple
element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non-software deliverable. The impact of the adoption of these amendments will depend on the nature of the arrangements that we
enter into subsequent to the date we adopt the amendments.

In
January 2010, an amendment to the FASB fair value guidance was issued. This amendment requires disclosures of transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2, more detailed roll
forward reconciliations of Level 3 recurring fair value measurements on a gross basis, fair value information by class of assets and liabilities, and descriptions of valuation techniques and
inputs for Level 2 and 3 measurements. We adopted the amendment during the first quarter of 2010, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements as this change is
disclosure-only in nature.

In
April 2010, the FASB issued guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or
development transactions. Research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon milestone events such as
successful completion of phases in a study or achieving a specific result from the research or development efforts. The amendments provide guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining
whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with
early adoption permitted.
We do not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.

Fair Value Measurements

FASB accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ("the
exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the
consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. In determining fair value we use quoted prices and observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of
inputs as follows:

Level 1—Valuations
based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2—Valuations
based on observable inputs and quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.

Level 3—Valuations
based on inputs that are unobservable and models that are significant to the overall fair value measurement.

Our
marketable securities consist of investments in corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury notes, and other U.S. government agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities
that are classified as available-for-sale. We classify marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and
(ii) we have the ability to hold them until the carrying value is recovered and such holding period may be longer than one year.

At
December 31, 2010, our Level 2 mortgage backed securities are valued using readily available pricing sources which utilize market observable inputs, including the
current interest rate and other characteristics for similar types of instruments.

Note 3. Concentrations of Credit Risk

In December 2009, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Lilly. In November 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with
Novartis. In November 2005, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer, which became effective in January 2006.

Note 4. License Agreements

Novartis

In November 2009, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis
received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including
all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. We retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to ruxolitinib in the United States and in certain other
indications. Novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c-MET inhibitor compound INCB28060 and certain back-up compounds in all
indications. We retained options to co-develop and to co-promote INCB28060 in the United States.

Under
this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to
approximately $1.1 billion if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved. In 2010, we recognized and received



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 4. License Agreements (Continued)

$50 million
in milestone payments for the initiation of the global Phase III trial, RESPONSE, in patients with polycythemia vera. We also could receive tiered, double digit royalties on
future ruxolitinib sales outside of the United States. Each company is responsible for costs relating to the development and commercialization of the JAK inhibitor compound in its respective
territories, with costs of collaborative studies shared equally. Novartis is responsible for all costs relating to the development
and commercialization of the c-MET inhibitor compound after the initial Phase I clinical trial.

The
Novartis agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until Novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier,
the termination of the agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis
by Novartis for convenience. The agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

We
determined that there were two deliverables under the agreement: (i) the ex U.S. license for ruxolitinib and (ii) our obligations in connection with our participation on
the joint development committee for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia. We concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the
$150.0 million upfront payment received in December 2009 and the immediate $60.0 million milestone payment received in January 2010 should be recognized on a straight line basis through
December 2013 when we estimate we will complete our obligations in connection with our participation on the joint development committee, our estimated performance period under the agreement. We have
no further substantive obligations to Novartis after the completion of our obligations in connection with the joint development committee. All future milestone payments will be recognized as revenue
upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

At
December 31, 2009, we recorded $10.9 million of reimbursable costs incurred prior to the effective date of the agreement as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance
sheet. These costs will be recognized on a straight line basis through December 2013 consistent with the aforementioned upfront and milestone payments. Future reimbursable costs incurred after the
effective date of the agreement with Novartis will be recorded net against the related research and development expenses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $4.6 million and
$3.2 million of reimbursable costs are included in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009
were net of $7.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by Novartis.

Contract
revenue under the Novartis agreement was $104.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Included in the
amount for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $50.0 million in connection with a milestone payment received from Novartis for the initiation of the joint, global, PV Phase III
trial, RESPONSE.

Lilly

In December 2009, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company. Under the terms of
the agreement, Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to LY3009104 and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We received
an initial payment of $90 million, and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to $665 million based on the achievement of defined development, regulatory and
commercialization milestones. In 2010, we recognized and received $49 million in milestone payments from Lilly. We also could receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global
sales with rates ranging up to 20% if the product is successfully commercialized.



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 4. License Agreements (Continued)

We retained options to co-develop our JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors with Lilly on a compound-by-compound and indication-by-indication
basis. Lilly will be responsible for all costs relating to the development and commercialization of the compounds unless we elect to co-develop any compounds or indications. If we elect to
co-develop any compounds and/or indications, we would be responsible for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs from the initiation of a Phase IIb trial. We
would receive an incremental royalty rate increase across all tiers resulting in effective royalty rates ranging up to the high twenties on potential future global sales for compounds and/or
indications that we elect to co-develop. We
also retained an option to co-promote products in the United States. In July 2010, we elected to co-develop LY3009104 with Lilly in rheumatoid arthritis and we are responsible
for funding 30% of the associated future global development costs for this indication from the initiation of a Phase IIb trial through regulatory approval. We have retained certain mechanisms
to give us cost protection as LY3009104 advances in clinical development. We can defer our portion of co-development study costs by indication if they exceed a predetermined level. This
deferment would be credited against future milestones or royalties and we would still be eligible for the full incremental royalties related to the co-development option. In addition, even
if we have started co-development funding for any indication, we can at any time opt out for that indication and stop future co-development cost sharing. If we elect to do this
we would still be eligible for our base royalties plus an incremental pro-rated royalty commensurate with our contribution to the total co-development cost for those
indications for which we co-funded. The Lilly agreement will continue until Lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in
accordance with its terms. The agreement may be terminated by Lilly for convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.

We
determined that there were two deliverables under the agreement: (i) the worldwide license and (ii) our obligations in connection with a co-development
option. We concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the $90.0 million upfront payment should be recognized on a straight line basis as
revenue through December 2016, our estimated performance period under the agreement. All milestone payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone. Reimbursable
costs incurred after the effective date with Lilly will be recorded net against the related research and development expenses. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $0.3 million and
$0.0 million of reimbursable costs are included in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009
were net of $2.8 million and $0.0 million, respectively, of costs reimbursed by Lilly.

Contract
revenue under the Lilly agreement was $61.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Included in the amount
for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $49.0 million in connection with milestone payments received from Lilly.

Pfizer

In January 2006, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the pursuit of our CCR2
antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications,
with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on pre-clinical
development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement. Prior to such
expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other



INCYTE CORPORATION

party
or for the insolvency of the other party. In addition, Pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. We received an upfront nonrefundable,
non-creditable payment of $40 million in January 2006 and are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments. Consistent with the terms of the agreement
and our original expectations at the inception of the agreement, the Research Plan concluded after two years in January 2008 and, as such, there are no remaining substantive obligations to Pfizer
under the agreement. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007 and a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2010.

Contract
revenue under the Pfizer agreement was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 in connection with milestone payments received from Pfizer. Contract
revenues related to the upfront consideration received, research services provided to Pfizer, and the difference between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes, of approximately
$0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 7. Convertible Notes (Continued)

In
September 2009, we completed the sale, in a private placement, of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Senior Notes, which resulted in net proceeds of
approximately $387.4 million. Entities affiliated with Julian C. Baker, one of our directors and principal stockholders (the "Baker Entities"), purchased $160.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes in this private placement.

The
4.75% Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, and are due October 1, 2015. The
4.75% Senior Notes are pari passu in right of payment with the 3


/


% Senior Notes and senior in right of payment to the 3


/


% Subordinated Notes and the Pfizer Notes. The
Indenture governing the 4.75% Senior Notes (the "Indenture") contains a covenant that, among other things, limits our ability and the ability of any of our subsidiaries to incur additional
indebtedness, create liens, or sell, lease, license, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain of our or their assets. This covenant is subject to a number of exceptions, limitations and qualifications
set forth in the Indenture. We may not redeem the 4.75% Senior Notes prior to their scheduled maturity date. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, subject to certain
conditions, holders may require us to repurchase their 4.75% Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount being purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, up to the date of
purchase. The 4.75% Senior Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 113.9601 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Senior Notes, equivalent to
an initial conversion price of approximately $8.78 per share. In addition, if, and to the extent, a holder elects to convert any 4.75% Senior Notes in connection with a make-whole
fundamental change transaction, as defined in the Indenture, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the applicable conversion rate by a number of additional shares of our common stock.

In
connection with the private placement of the 4.75% Senior Notes, we entered into a Pledge and Escrow Agreement, pursuant to which an aggregate of approximately $56.2 million
was placed into an escrow account. Funds in the escrow account will be invested in Permitted Securities (as defined in the Pledge and Escrow Agreement), and a portion of the Permitted Securities may
be redeemed or sold for cash to make each of the first six scheduled semi-annual interest payments on the 4.75% Senior Notes. Pursuant to the Pledge and Escrow Agreement, we have pledged
our interest in the escrow account to the Trustee under the Indenture as security for these interest payments. The
amounts held in escrow, totaling $37.9 million as of December 31, 2010, are included within restricted cash (short and long-term) in the consolidated balance sheet.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, through various privately negotiated transactions, we repurchased $96.2 million in face value of our 3

Notes and $131.0 million in face value of our 3

In

principal
amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest of $0.1 million to the redemption date. We used a total of $158.6 million in cash to fund this redemption.

Due
to the variable mix of common stock and series A preferred stock that would have been issued to satisfy the conversion of the 4.75% Senior Notes until we had reserved
sufficient shares of our common stock, the embedded conversion feature was not considered indexed to our stock. As a result, the embedded conversion feature was not eligible for equity classification
and was required to be bifurcated from the underlying debt instrument until we had reserved sufficient shares of our common stock. Accordingly, the fair value of the embedded conversion feature on
September 30, 2009 of $148.1 million was recorded as a derivative liability and the carrying value of the 4.75% Senior Notes was reduced to reflect a debt discount equal to the fair
value of the embedded conversion feature. The derivative liability related to the conversion feature was revalued on November 24, 2009, the date we increased the number of shares of our common
stock authorized for issuance in an amount sufficient to satisfy conversion of the 4.75% Senior Notes. The fair value of the derivative liability was increased to $182.4 million as, among other
factors, our stock price increased from September 30, 2009, and the change in fair market value of $34.3 million was recorded in earnings. As we had reserved sufficient shares of our
common stock to satisfy the conversion provisions of the 4.75% Senior Notes, the conversion feature is considered indexed to our stock and the fair value of the conversion feature has been
reclassified from a liability into stockholders' deficit at December 31, 2009. The debt discount related to the derivative liability is being amortized to interest expense over the six year
term of the 4.75% Senior Notes using the effective interest method. We valued the embedded conversion feature using a single factor binomial lattice model, with the assistance of a valuation
consultant. This model incorporates inputs such as stock price, historical volatility, risk free interest rate, equivalent bond yield, as well as assumptions about fundamental change and note holder
behavior.

In
connection with the collaborative research and license agreement, Pfizer purchased a $10.0 million principal amount Pfizer Note in February 2006 and an additional
$10.0 million principal amount Pfizer Note in October 2007. The Pfizer Notes bear no interest, are due seven years from the date of issuance and are convertible into our common stock at initial
conversion prices of $6.8423 and $9.75 per share, respectively, subject to adjustments. The Pfizer Notes are subordinated to all senior indebtedness, including the 3


/


% Senior Notes,
and pari passu in right of payment with our 3


/


% Subordinated Notes. We may, at our option, repay the Pfizer Notes beginning February 3, 2009 and October 10, 2010,
respectively. Pfizer may require us to repay the Pfizer Notes upon a change of control, as defined. As the Pfizer Notes are non interest bearing, they have been discounted to their net present value
of $6.8 million each by imputing interest at a rate of 4.5% and 3.9%, respectively, which represented market conditions in place at the time the notes were issued. The carrying value of the
Pfizer Notes were $8.9 million and $8.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. We will accrete the Pfizer Notes up to their face value over their term of seven years by
recording interest expense under the effective interest method.

Note 8. Other Expenses

The estimates below have been made based upon management's best estimate of the amounts and timing of certain events included in the restructuring plan that will occur in the future. It
is possible that the actual outcome of certain events may differ from the estimates. Changes will be made to the restructuring accrual at the point that the differences become determinable. The
accrual balances for the restructuring plans are included in accrued restructuring and other liabilities (long-term) in the consolidated balance sheets.

In November 2002, we announced plans to reduce our expenditures, primarily in research and development, through a combination of spending
reductions, workforce reductions, and office consolidations for which our remaining lease expired in December 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized
additional charges (benefits) of $(0.6) million, $1.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, primarily relating to this facility for lease expenses in excess of or less than amounts
originally estimated. We estimated the costs based on the contractual terms of agreements and current real estate market conditions.

Note 9. Stockholders' Deficit

Preferred Stock.

We are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which was outstanding as of December 31,
2009. The
Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences and privileges of any preferred stock issued in the future. From September 30, 2009 to November 24, 2009 we had reserved 100,000
shares of preferred stock designated as series A preferred stock for issuance in connection with our 4.75% Senior Notes, as described in Note 8 above. On November 25, 2009, we
filed a Certificate of Elimination of the Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Elimination") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware relating
to our Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock, which we had originally filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 29, 2009 (the "Certificate
of Designation"). The
Certificate of Elimination had the effect of eliminating from our Restated Certificate of Incorporation all matters set forth in the Certificate of Designation.

Common Stock.

At the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on November 24, 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to our
Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 9. Stockholders' Deficit (Continued)

common
stock authorized for issuance from 200,000,000 shares to 400,000,000 shares. Following the Special Meeting of Stockholders, we filed a Certificate of Amendment of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to amend our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect the increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock.

On
September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of 20,700,000 shares of our authorized but unissued common stock at a price to the public of $6.75 per share pursuant to an
effective shelf registration statement, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $132.3 million. The Baker Entities purchased an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock in this
offering.

On
August 6, 2008, we completed a public offering of 12,075,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $9.00 per share pursuant to an effective shelf registration
statement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $101.7 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Baker Entities purchased an aggregate of 1,100,000
shares of common stock in this offering.

Stock Compensation Plans.

As of December 31, 2010, we had reserved a total of 26,658,865 shares of our common stock for future
issuance
related to our stock plans as described below. Summaries of stock option activity for our stock option plans as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and related information for the years ended
December 31 are included in the plan descriptions below.

1991 Stock Plan.

In November 1991, the Board of Directors adopted the 1991 Stock Plan (the "Stock Plan"), which was amended and restated
for issuance
of common stock to employees, consultants, and scientific advisors. Options issued under the plan are, at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, either incentive stock
options, non-statutory stock options or restricted stock units. The exercise prices of incentive and non-statutory stock options granted under the plan are not less than the
fair market value on the date of the grant, as determined
by the Board of Directors. Options granted after February 2007 generally vest over three years, pursuant to a formula determined by our Board of Directors, and expire after seven years. Options
granted prior to February 2007 generally vest over four years, pursuant to a formula determined by our Board of Directors, and expire after ten years. Certain options granted in 2002 vest pro rata
monthly over three years and expire after ten years. In May 2008, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan from
25,350,000 to 29,350,000. In May 2009, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan from 29,350,000 to 30,475,000.

2010 Stock Incentive Plan.

In May 2010 the Board of Directors adopted the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan") for issuance of
common stock to
employees, non-employee directors, consultants, and scientific advisors. Options granted to employees, consultants, and scientific advisors under the 2010 Plan vest over three years,
pursuant to a formula determined by our Board of Directors, and expire after seven years. Each new non-employee director joining the Board will receive an option to purchase 35,000 shares
of common stock which vest over four years. Additionally, members who continue to serve on the Board will receive annual option grants for 20,000 shares exercisable in full on the first anniversary of
the date of the grant. All options are exercisable at the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Non-employee director options expire after ten years. In May 2010, our
stockholders approved the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan of 5,400,000 plus the number of shares of Common Stock previously approved by our stockholders and
remaining available for issuance and not subject to outstanding awards under the 1991 Stock Plan and the 1993 Directors' Stock Option Plan, which was 653,475 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

On May 21, 1997, our stockholders adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). In May
2008, our
stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares available for grant from 3,850,000 shares to 4,600,000 shares. In May 2009, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares
available for grant from 4,600,000 shares to 5,350,000 shares. In May 2010, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares available for grant from 5,350,000 shares to 7,350,000 shares.
Each regular full-time and part-time employee working 20 hours or more per week is eligible to participate after one month of employment. We issued 1,182,929, 748,558
and 442,749 shares under the ESPP in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we recorded stock compensation expense of $0.8 million,
$0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, as the ESPP is considered compensatory under the FASB stock compensation rules. As of December 31, 2010, 1,764,248 shares remain
available for issuance under the ESPP.

Note 10. Stock Compensation

Under FASB accounting guidance for stock compensation, we recorded $14.9 million, $10.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, of stock compensation expense on our
audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. We utilized the Black-Scholes valuation

The
risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Federal Reserve rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected life calculation is based on the observed and expected
time to the exercise of options by our employees based on historical exercise patterns for similar type options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the
period commensurate with the expected life of the options. A dividend yield of zero is assumed based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash
dividends.

Based
on our historical experience, we have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of 5% for our options. Under the true-up provisions of SFAS 123R, we will record
additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than we estimated, and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than we estimated.

Total
compensation cost of options granted but not yet vested, as of December 31, 2010, was $9.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted average
period of 2.94 years.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by approximately $11.0 million, $68.0 million and $76.0 million during the years ended December 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Management believes the uncertainty regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets requires a full valuation allowance.

As
of December 31, 2010, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.0 billion that will expire at various dates beginning in 2021 through
2030, if not utilized. Our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 ("Section 382"). Section 382 imposes annual limitations on the
utilization of NOL carryfowards and other tax attributes upon an ownership change. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions that increase the aggregate ownership of certain
stockholders in our stock by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period (generally three years). These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and
development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively.

We
completed a Section 382 analysis during 2010. Based on this analysis, our NOLs and other tax attributes should not be limited under Section 382. Our future utilization
of all of our NOLs and other tax attributes is dependent upon the our ability to generate sufficient income during the carryforward periods and no future significant changes in ownership. When tax
attributes are used, NOLs are used before tax credits and this will likely result in expiration of the tax credits.

We
adopted the FASB uncertain tax positions guidance on January 1, 2007. We had no unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007 and provide a full valuation allowance on
the net deferred tax asset recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the adoption effective January 1, 2007 had no effect on our financial position as of such date, or
on net operating losses available to offset future taxable income.

We
recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not accrue any interest related to
uncertain tax positions. Our

income
taxes have not been subject to examination by any tax jurisdictions since its inception. Due to NOL and tax credit carryforwards, all income tax returns filed by us are subject to examination
by the taxing jurisdictions.

We
had taxable income of approximately $160.0 million in 2010 due primarily to timing differences between book and tax for upfront payments received from collaborative partners.
In connection with the adoption of stock-based compensation guidance in 2006, we elected to follow the with-and-without approach to determine the sequence in which deductions
and NOL carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, no tax benefit related to stock options was recognized in the current year as a result of the utilization of approximately $160.0 million of NOL
carryforwards. The table of deferred tax assets shown above does not include certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity
compensation in excess of compensation recognized for book purposes. Additional paid in capital will be increased by approximately $64.8 million if and when such deferred tax assets are
ultimately realized.

At
December 31, 2010, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $74.3 million that will expire at various dates,
beginning in 2011 through 2030, if not utilized.

Note 13. Segment Reporting

Our operations are treated as one operating segment, drug discovery and development.

Note 14. Defined Contribution Plan

We have a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering all domestic employees. Employees may contribute a portion of their
compensation, which is then matched by us, subject to certain limitations. Defined contribution expense was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Note 15. Litigation

In July 2010, Genomic Health, Inc. ("Genomic Health") filed an action against us in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, seeking to recover money
paid to us pursuant to the LifeSeq Collaborative Agreement between Genomic Health and us dated March 30, 2001, as amended. The complaint seeks the sum of $3,576,681 and interest. We have filed
an answer to Genomic Health's claims and asserted a breach of contract counterclaim. Further, we have successfully removed this litigation to the Northern District of California. A mediation between
the parties has been scheduled for March 10, 2011. The trial in this lawsuit is set to begin on December 12, 2011.

We
believe that we have meritorious defenses to Genomic Health's claims and intend to vigorously defend the suit brought by Genomic Health. In management's opinion, the outcome of such
action will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Note 16. Related Party Transactions

The following summarizes our related party transactions. In each of the transactions noted in which a director of Incyte was at the time of the transaction in some way affiliated with
the other party to the transaction, such director recused himself from voting on the related party transaction.

On
September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of 20,700,000 shares of our authorized but unissued common stock at a price to the public of $6.75 per share pursuant to an
effective shelf
registration statement, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $132.3 million. The Baker Entities purchased an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in this offering.

On
September 30, 2009, we completed the sale, in a private placement, of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Senior Notes, which resulted in net proceeds
of approximately $387.4 million. The Baker Entities purchased $160.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes in this private placement. Through various privately
negotiated transactions, we repurchased $96.2 million in face value of our 3

% Subordinated
Notes. Among these transactions were the repurchases from the Baker Entities of $38.3 million in face value of our 3

% Subordinated Notes at a purchase price equal to 97.88% of face value. The prices paid by us in the repurchase transactions with
the Baker Entities were equal to the weighted average prices paid by us to independent third parties in comparable transactions for the balance of the notes repurchased during this period.

On
August 6, 2008, we completed a public offering of 12,075,000 shares of our authorized but unissued common stock at a price to the public of $9.00 per share pursuant to an
effective shelf registration statement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $101.7 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Baker Entities purchased
an aggregate of 1,100,000 shares of our common stock in this offering.

Note 17. Commitments

As of December 31, 2010, we had non-cancelable operating leases on multiple facilities and equipment, including facilities in Palo Alto, California and Wilmington,
Delaware. The leases expire on various dates ranging from March 2011 to June 2013. Certain leases have renewal options for periods ranging up to 5 years. Rent expense for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, was approximately $5.4 million, $5.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2010, future non-cancelable minimum payments under operating leases, including leases for sites included in the restructuring programs were as
follows:

Note 17. Commitments (Continued)

The
amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations. We have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space
with scheduled payments to us of $0.4 million (less than 1 year) which are not reflected in the table above.

The
table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events. The most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations
are summarized below.

Commitments
related to Maxia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable. In February
2003, we completed our acquisition of Maxia. Under the merger agreement, former Maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of
$14.0 million upon the occurrence of
certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement. Twenty percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in
shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million in our common stock (based upon the then fair value) could potentially be paid pursuant to the
earn out milestones. The milestones are set to occur as Maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of
the merger. In any event, no more than 13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to former Maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement. None of these milestones has
been achieved as of December 31, 2010.

We
have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these
licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products.

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards.
Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte Corporation

We
have audited Incyte Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Incyte Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Incyte Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Incyte Corporation as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2010 of Incyte Corporation and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
