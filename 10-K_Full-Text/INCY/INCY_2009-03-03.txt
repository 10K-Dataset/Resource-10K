Our productivity in drug discovery and development is primarily a result of our core competency in medicinal chemistry which is tightly integrated with and
supported by an experienced team of biologists with expertise in multiple therapeutic areas. As a number of our compounds have progressed into clinical development, we have also built a clinical
development and regulatory team. This team utilizes clinical research organizations (CROs), expert scientific advisory boards, and leading consultants and suppliers in relevant drug development areas
in an effort to conduct our clinical trials as efficiently and effectively as possible while maintaining strategic control of the design and management of our programs.

In
2009, due to the challenging economic environment, we decided to focus our efforts on clinical programs that we believe have a greater likelihood of creating near-term
value. Therefore, programs that will not receive funding in 2009 include:

•

JAK inhibitor for multiple myeloma and hormone refractory prostate cancer

•

HM74a agonist for type 2 diabetes

•

CCR2 receptor antagonist for multiple sclerosis

•

CCR5 receptor antagonist for HIV

Incyte's Approach to Drug Discovery and Development

To succeed in our objective to create a pipeline of novel, orally available drugs that address serious unmet medical needs, we have
established a broad range of discovery capabilities in-house, including target validation, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and
pharmacological and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) assessment. We augment these capabilities through collaborations with academic and contract laboratory resources with
relevant expertise.

We
select drug targets with strong preclinical or clinical validation in areas where we have the potential to generate either first-in-class molecules or
compounds that are highly differentiated from existing treatments.

Our
chemistry and biology efforts are highly integrated and are characterized by the rapid generation of relevant data on a broad and diverse range of compounds for each therapeutic
target we pursue. This process allows our scientists to better understand, in real time, the potency and selectivity of the compounds, how they are likely to be absorbed and eliminated in the body,
and to assess the potential safety of the compounds. We believe that this approach, along with stringent criteria for the selection of clinical candidates, allows us to select appropriate candidates
for clinical development and rapidly assess key characteristics required for success.

Given
our chemistry-driven discovery process, our pipeline has grown to encompass multiple therapeutic areas, primarily in the areas of oncology, inflammation, and diabetes. While our
productivity has created a diverse pipeline, we conduct a limited number of discovery programs in
parallel at any one time. This focus allows us to allocate resources to our selected programs at a level that we believe is competitive with much larger pharmaceutical companies. We believe this level
of resource allocation, applied to the discovery process outlined above, has been critical to our success in our current programs, and that it remains a meaningful competitive advantage.

Additionally,
in all of our programs we strive to generate a broad range of proprietary compounds which we believe enhances the overall probability of success for our programs and
creates the potential for multiple products.

Once
our compounds reach clinical development, our objective, whenever possible, is to rapidly progress the lead candidate into a proof-of-concept clinical trial
prior to initiating larger definitive Phase IIb clinical trials to quickly assess the therapeutic potential of the clinical candidate itself and its



underlying
mechanism. This information is then used to evaluate the commercial potential of the compound and the most appropriate indication or indications to pursue.

Incyte's Development Teams

Our development teams are responsible for ensuring that our clinical candidates are expeditiously progressed from preclinical
development and Investigational New Drug application (IND)-enabling studies into human testing. To keep pace with the growth in our clinical pipeline, we have added new members to the development
teams by internal transfers and by recruiting new employees with expertise in drug development including clinical trial design, statistics, regulatory affairs, and project management. We have also
built core internal process chemistry and formulation teams using this same strategy. Rather than build expensive infrastructure, we work with external CROs with expertise in managing clinical trials,
process chemistry, product formulation, and the manufacture of clinical trial supplies to support our drug development efforts.

Clinical Pipeline

Our pipeline includes compounds in various stages of development in the areas of oncology, inflammation, diabetes and HIV.

Our
JAK inhibitors are our lead program with opportunities for INCB18424 in myelofibrosis as well as the other myeloproliferative disorders, polycythemia vera and essential
thrombocythemia. This program includes INCB28050, which we have selected as our lead compound to treat inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. We are also developing INCB18424 in a
topical formulation for mild to moderate psoriasis.

Other
priority programs include our HSD1 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes which, provided results from an ongoing Phase IIb trial are positive, we are seeking to partner, and
our sheddase inhibitor for breast cancer. We have two new early stage oncology programs that have been cleared for human testing. The first program is our new c-MET inhibitor and the
second program involves novel inhibitors of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). We do not expect to initiate clinical trials for these two new oncology programs in 2009 unless we are
successful in securing additional funding.

The
following summarizes the status of and rationale for our most advanced compounds.

JAK Program for Inflammation, Hematologic Malignancies, and Solid Tumors

The JAK family is composed of four tyrosine kinases – JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2 – that are involved in
signaling triggered by a number of cytokines and growth factors. JAKs are central to a number of biologic processes, including the formation and development of blood cells and the regulation of immune
functions. Excessive signaling through the JAK pathways is believed to play a critical role in a number of disease states, including myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), specifically myelofibrosis
(MF), polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET), inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis, and certain other solid and liquid tumors. Additionally, many
MPD patients have a mutation that is associated with JAK2, V617F, as well as other JAK2-related mutations, which result in increased JAK signaling suggesting that activation of the JAK
pathways is central to these disorders.

We
have discovered multiple potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK inhibitors that are selective for JAK1 and JAK2 from several distinct chemical scaffolds. Our lead JAK
inhibitor, INCB18424, is currently being developed as an oral treatment for MF, PV, and ET and as a topical treatment for psoriasis. Thus far, our clinical trial results with INCB18424 include
positive Phase II results in MF, RA and psoriasis patients and the compound has been well tolerated suggesting that further development is warranted. INCB28050 is completing Phase I
development and, assuming successful completion of Phase I, we expect to start Phase II development in the first half of 2009.



Myelofibrosis.

We have completed enrollment of a Phase II trial for MF with INCB18424. The Phase II trial includes data from
over 150
MF patients and has demonstrated that INCB18424 provided reductions in splenomegaly which affects the majority of MF patients, and clinically meaningful improvements in the constitutional symptoms of
MF including reductions in fatigue, night sweats, pruritus, abdominal discomfort, poor appetite and cachexia.

In
December 2008, we filed a request for a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to confirm the potential registration pathway for INCB18424
as a treatment for MF. We received the FDA's initial response to the SPA in February 2009. We plan to respond to the FDA's input in the near future. Provided the Agency agrees with our response, we
expect to initiate a Phase III registration trial in the U.S. in the first half of 2009. The FDA has also granted INCB18424 orphan drug status as a treatment for MF.

In
Europe, we received scientific advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) regarding their requirements for approval
and we intend to begin a second Phase III trial in Europe in the first half of 2009. We have received an orphan medicinal product designation from the EMEA for INCB18424 for the treatment of
chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. In February 2009, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) of the EMEA informed us that it had adopted a positive opinion regarding our request for orphan
medicinal product designation of INCB18424 for the treatment of post-PV and post-ET MF.

Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia.

We began a dose-ranging Phase II trial in advanced PV and ET to evaluate
INCB18424 in these patients in the summer of 2008. This phase II trial is expected to involve up to 50 patients with PV and up to 50 patients with ET, all of whom are refractory to or
intolerant of hydroxyurea. Results from this trial are expected in the second half of 2009.

Rheumatoid Arthritis.

In October 2008, we announced results from a 28-day Phase IIa dose-ranging trial using the oral
formulation of INCB18424 in 50 RA patients whose conditions were not well-controlled with their existing therapy. Results from the
50-patient placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that three of the four doses of INCB18424 evaluated produced significant clinical benefits and all of the doses were well tolerated.

We
also have a JAK inhibitor, INCB28050, that is completing Phase I development. Based on both pre-clinical and clinical results, INCB28050 appears to be as
efficacious as INCB18424 and may offer some potential dosing advantages. Given the challenging economic environment and our objective to reduce spending in 2009, together with our desire to have a
separate compound for inflammation, we have discontinued development of INCB18424 in RA and we intend to move INCB28050 forward as our lead oral anti-inflammatory compound. This decision
also supports our intent to secure a partner for chronic inflammatory conditions while retaining development and commercial rights to oral INCB18424 for myelofibrosis as well as for PV and ET.

Psoriasis (Topical).

In September 2008, we announced results from a completed 28-day Phase IIa dose-escalation trial
with topical INCB18424, involving 28 patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis and preliminary results from an ongoing 28-day sub-total inunction trial.
Results from these trials demonstrated that topical INCB18424 in mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients was well tolerated at all doses tested thus far and significantly improved
overall total lesion score (thickness, erythema, and scaling). In addition to the safety and efficacy results, transcriptional profiling data from the sub-total inunction trial
demonstrated that topical INCB18424 inhibits two key pathways, Th1 and Th17, which play important roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. A three-month multiple-dose Phase IIb trial
involving approximately 200 psoriasis patients with mild-to-moderate disease is currently underway with results expected in mid 2009.

Refractory Prostate Cancer and Multiple Myeloma.

In 2008, we initiated two proof-of-concept Phase IIa clinical trials
to evaluate INCB18424 as a treatment for refractory prostate cancer patients as



well
as patients with multiple myeloma. Results from these initial Phase II trials demonstrated some changes in clinical markers; however, given our objective to reduce spending in 2009, we do
not plan further development of INCB18424 for these indications at this time.

11ßHSD1 Program for Type 2 Diabetes and Related Disorders

We have developed a broad chemically diverse series of novel proprietary oral inhibitors of 11ßHSD1, an enzyme that
converts the biologically-inactive steroid cortisone into the potent biologically-active hormone cortisol. Cortisol acts as a functional antagonist of insulin action in multiple tissue types,
including the liver, adipose, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Inhibition of 11

b

HSD1 offers the potential to reduce insulin resistance and restore glycemic control
in type 2 diabetes, and may also offer potential benefits in allied conditions such as dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease.

In
June 2008, we reported results from a 28-day Phase IIa clinical trial in type 2 diabetes. These results showed that 28 days of treatment with
INCB13739 significantly improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and decreased plasma LDL- and total-cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. We have completed enrollment of
a three-month Phase IIb trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple once-daily dose regimens of INCB13739 when added to a failing metformin monotherapy. The
primary endpoint of the trial is the change from baseline to week 12 in hemoglobin A1c. Results from this trial are expected in mid 2009. If results from this trial are positive, we intend to seek a
strategic partner for this program.

We
also completed Phase I trials for INCB20817, our follow – on 11ßHSD1 compound, in 2008.

Sheddase Inhibitor Program for Solid Tumors

As the fundamental biology of cancer has been explored at the molecular level, new therapeutics are emerging that distinguish
themselves from the classic, relatively non-selective, cytotoxic agents. These new therapeutics are targeted specifically to pathways or proteins that are more critical for the growth of
tumor cells than for the growth of normal cells, thereby having the potential to provide a greater therapeutic benefit, both when used alone and in combination with cytotoxic agents. Currently
available therapeutics of this type have been shown to be effective in the treatment of certain important tumor types.

The
signaling pathways that utilize the receptors and ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family play a key role in the growth and survival of multiple tumor types,
including breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers. The EGFR, or HER, signaling pathways consist of four known cellular receptors: HER1 (also known as EGFR), HER2, HER3, and
HER4. Under normal conditions, these pathways are tightly regulated. However, in cancer, the pathways can become dysregulated and changes in the amount or the activity of HER family members, primarily
HER1, HER2 and HER3, have been shown to impact the growth, proliferation, migration, and survival of cancer cells. Sheddase is an enzyme that is believed to activate all four EGFR pathways.

Currently
approved therapies target one or more of the EGFR pathways. However, these currently available therapeutics may not block all EGFR family-mediated signaling, even in the tumor
types in which they are approved. In contrast, we believe our sheddase inhibitor targets all four EGFR signaling pathways and may provide meaningful advantages over therapies that target one or two.

We
have identified novel, potent, and orally available small-molecule inhibitors of sheddase that, in preclinical models, show efficacy as single agents and show synergy with other
targeted therapeutic agents and with cytotoxics. INCB7839, the lead compound from this program, is currently in a Phase II clinical trial designed to determine the effectiveness of INCB7839
when used in combination with Herceptin. Results from this trial are expected in the second half of 2009.



c-MET for Solid Tumors

c-MET is a clinically validated receptor kinase cancer target and abnormal c-MET activation in cancer
correlates with poor prognosis. Dysregulation of the c-MET pathway triggers tumor growth, formation of new blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients, and causes cancer to spread
to other organs. Dysregulation of the c-MET pathway is seen in many types of cancers including kidney, liver, stomach, breast, and brain.

Several
small molecule c-MET kinase inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in a number of cancers; however, these molecules have limited potency and are relatively
non-selective, which could lead to off-target toxicities. We believe our lead c-MET inhibitor, INCB28060, has the requisite properties to overcome these
limitations, including greater selectivity, improved potency and more effective inhibition of c-MET. We do not expect to initiate clinical trials for this program in 2009 unless we are
successful in securing additional funding.

IDO for Solid Tumors

The enzyme, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, IDO, is a key regulator of the mechanisms that are responsible for allowing
tumors to escape from a patient's immune surveillance. IDO expression by tumor cells, or by antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells in tumors, creates an environment in which
tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are rendered functionally inactive or are no longer able to attack a patient's cancer cells. By inhibiting IDO, it is proposed that this "brake" on the
anti-tumor immune response is removed, allowing anti-tumor specific cytotoxic T cells, generated in a patient spontaneously in response to the tumor, or through a therapy
designed to stimulate the immune response, to have greater anti-tumor efficacy.

We
believe our compound, INCB24360, represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO. It is efficacious in multiple mouse models of cancer and has been
well-tolerated in preclinical safety studies. We do not expect to initiate clinical trials for this program in 2009 unless we are successful in securing additional funding.

Other Programs

We are evaluating our HM74a agonist, INCB19602, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. HM74a is a G protein coupled receptor that
is expressed in human adipose tissue. Stimulation of this receptor by niacin, also known as nicotinic acid, blocks the release of free fatty acids (FFA) from this tissue. Elevated levels of FFAs are
associated with an increase in glucose production and a decrease in glucose disposal which leads to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. We conducted a 28-day Phase IIa trial with
INCB19602 in type 2 diabetics and, despite what we believe was promising early clinical data, the fasting plasma glucose data from that trial demonstrated too high a degree of variability to
draw meaningful conclusions. We believe a 3-month trial that follows hemoglobin A1c levels as the clinical endpoint will be required to determine whether this mechanism warrants further
development as treatment for type 2 diabetes. Given our decision to prioritize our clinical activities and reduce our spending in 2009, we have decided not to initiate the 3-month
trial at this time.

We
also do not plan to further develop our CCR2 antagonist compound, INCB8696, for multiple sclerosis or our CCR5 antagonist compounds, INCB9471 or INCB15050, for HIV. These compounds
address markets that require extensive clinical development programs and are outside our core areas of focus and we have decided to seek partnerships for both programs. CCR2 is a chemokine receptor
that is involved in the trafficking of certain inflammatory cells called monocytes. These monocytes are believed to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including multiple
sclerosis. A CCR2 antagonist has the potential to block this process. CCR5 is the chemokine receptor which certain forms of the HIV virus use to gain entry into cells and infect the host. When a CCR5
antagonist is bound to the receptor, the virus cannot interact with the receptor and, thus, viral entry is blocked.



Discovery

We have a number of early discovery programs at various stages of preclinical testing. We do not typically disclose these programs
and/or targets until we have successfully completed preclinical toxicology tests with the lead clinical candidate.

Commercial Strategy

Our strategy is to develop and commercialize our compounds on our own in selected markets when we believe a company of our size can
successfully compete, such as in MF, other myeloproliferative disorders, and certain inflammatory conditions. Our oral JAK inhibitor, INCB18424, is currently scheduled to enter Phase III
testing in the first half of 2009 for MF and, if these results are positive, may receive expedited FDA review. In anticipation of the regulatory approval of INCB18424 for MF, we have started to build
the infrastructure to support commercialization.

We
intend to seek partners or strategic alliances to support development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates, including those that are outside of our core
expertise, focused on large primary care markets and/or require lengthy and expensive clinical studies. We established such a strategic alliance with Pfizer in 2005 to advance our CCR2 antagonist
program. We believe the key benefits to partnering include the potential to receive upfront payments and future milestones and royalties in exchange for certain rights to our compounds, as well as to
expedite the development and potential commercialization of certain of our compounds.

Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer

Effective in January 2006, we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") for the pursuit
of our CCR2 antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential
indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on
pre-clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the
agreement. Prior to such expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. In addition,
Pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. We received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40 million in January 2006 and are
eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property

We regard the protection of patents and other enforceable intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our
business and competitive position. Accordingly, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright law, as well as nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual property. We
have established a patent portfolio of owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications that cover aspects of all our drug candidates, as well as other patents and patent applications
that relate to full-length genes and genomics-related technologies obtained as a result of our past high-throughput gene sequencing efforts. The patents and patent applications
relating to our drug candidates generally include claims directed to the drug candidates, methods of using the drug candidates, formulations of the drug candidates, and methods of manufacturing the
drug candidates. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries we believe that are commercially important to the development and growth of our business.

Patents
extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual
protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.



We have a number of established patent license agreements relating to our gene patent portfolio and our genomics-related technology patent portfolio. We are
presently receiving royalties and other payments under certain of our gene and genomics-related patent license agreements. Under our gene patent license agreements, we may in the future receive
royalties and other payments if our partners are successful in their efforts to discover drugs and diagnostics under these license agreements.

We
may seek to license rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may be required to pay
up-front fees, license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products.

Although
we believe our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly
uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents in the United States or elsewhere from
pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be valid or enforceable or may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned
by or licensed to us or
provide us with a competitive advantage. Any patent or other intellectual property rights that we own or obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. Others may have
patents that relate to our business or technology and that may prevent us from marketing our product candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. In addition, litigation or
other proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce patents, to protect our other intellectual property rights, to determine the scope and validity of the
proprietary rights of third parties or to defend ourselves in patent or other intellectual property right suits brought by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in such litigation or other
proceedings. An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liability.

With
respect to proprietary information that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality
agreements to protect our interests. While we require all employees, consultants and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our
trade secrets or other proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.

Competition

Our drug discovery and development activities face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. Our major competitors include fully integrated pharmaceutical companies that have
extensive drug discovery efforts and are developing novel small molecule pharmaceuticals. We face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with
our potential products.

Many
companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs
than we do. In addition, many competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in:

•

drug discovery;

•

developing products;

•

undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials;

•

obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and

•

manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling products.



Accordingly,
our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA and other regulatory approval or commercializing products before we do. If we commence commercial
product sales, we will be competing against companies with greater manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience.

In
addition, any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise
from:

•

other drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease;

•

new small molecules; or

•

other classes of therapeutic agents.

Developments
by others may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative
arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to proprietary technology. These competitors,
either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing products that are more effective than ours.

Our
ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

•

develop proprietary products;

•

develop and maintain products that reach the market first, are technologically superior to and/or are of lower cost than
other products in the market;

•

attract and retain scientific and product development personnel;

•

obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;

•

obtain required regulatory approvals; and

•

manufacture, market, distribute and sell any products that we develop.

In
a number of countries, including in particular, developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs available at
a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do
so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for their drugs in certain developing countries. If certain
countries do not permit enforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in those countries, and in other countries by importation from low-price countries, could be reduced by
generic competition or by parallel importation of our product. Alternatively, governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and
sell their own versions of our products in those countries, thereby reducing our product sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products. In all of these
situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Government Regulation

Our related ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and marketing of our potential small molecule products to
treat major medical conditions are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any drug
developed by us must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of these



products.
None of our drug candidates has, to date, been submitted for approval for sale in the United States or any foreign market. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes
preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and
supporting information to the FDA for each indication to establish a drug candidate's safety and efficacy. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources,
involves post-marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. Before commencing clinical investigations of a drug candidate in humans,
we must submit an IND, which must by reviewed by FDA.

The
steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:

•

preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;

•

submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may
commence;

•

adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish the safety and
efficacy of the drug for each indication;

•

submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for review;

•

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to
assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices; and

•

FDA approval of the NDA.

Similar
requirements exist within many foreign agencies as well. The time required to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary
substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.

Preclinical
testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and toxicity which includes animal studies, as well as product chemistry and formulation
development. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND will automatically become effective
30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND. In the latter
case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing
clinical trials to commence.

Clinical
trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols
detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and
each trial must be
reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board (IRB) before it can begin.

Clinical
trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the
investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its
effectiveness. Phase II usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to:

•

evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage;

•

identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and

•

evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications.

Phase III
clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical
evidence of efficacy and safety and



providing
an adequate basis for physician labeling. We cannot guarantee that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of
time, if at all. Furthermore, we or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health
risk.

As
a separate amendment to an IND, a clinical trial sponsor may submit a request for a special protocol assessment (SPA) from the FDA. Under the SPA procedure, a sponsor may seek the
FDA's agreement on the design and size of a clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. If the FDA agrees in writing, its agreement may not be changed after the trial
begins, except in limited circumstances, such as when a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate is identified after a Phase III
clinical trial is commenced and agreement is obtained with the FDA. If the outcome of the trial is successful, the sponsor will ordinarily be able to rely on it as the primary basis for approval with
respect to
effectiveness. The FDA, however, may make an approval decision based on a number of factors, including the degree of clinical benefit, and the FDA is not obligated to approve an NDA as a result of an
SPA, even if the clinical outcome is positive.

Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies, including post-approval trials, may be required to provide additional data and will be required to gain
approval for the sale of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA will require
post-approval reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand the indications for which the drug product may be
marketed. Further, if there are any requests for modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing facilities, a
supplemental NDA may be required to be submitted to the FDA.

Clinical
trials must meet requirements for IRB/ethics committee oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices. In the United States, clinical trials must be conducted under FDA
oversight. Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the patient population that will be treated. If regulatory approval of a
product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical trials. Marketing or promoting a
drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited. Furthermore, approval may entail ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed
product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or
facility may result in restrictions on this product, manufacturer or facility, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market.

The
length of time and related costs necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying
interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or cause the costs of these clinical trials to
increase, include:

•

slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility
criteria for the study, competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates or other factors;

•

inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials;

•

delays in approvals from a study site's IRB;

•

longer than anticipated treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or determine the appropriate product dose;

•

lack of sufficient supplies of the drug candidate for use in clinical trials;



•

adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and

•

lack of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested.

Any
drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of
time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level, and at any time in the course of animal studies designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as
toxicological studies, or in clinical trials of our potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay
or abort the development of any of our drug candidates, and could ultimately prevent their marketing approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.

The
FDA's fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening
diseases and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for these conditions. Under this program, the FDA can, for example, review portions of an NDA for a fast track product before
the entire application is complete, thus potentially beginning the review process at an earlier time.

We
cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant any of our requests for fast track designation, that any fast track designation would affect the time of review or that the FDA will approve
the NDA submitted for any of our drug candidates, whether or not fast track designation is granted. Additionally, FDA approval of a fast track product can include restrictions on the product's use or
distribution (such as permitting use only for specified medical conditions or limiting distribution to physicians or facilities with special training or experience). Approval of fast track products
can be conditioned on additional clinical trials after approval.

FDA
procedures also provide for priority review of NDAs submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, offer a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or
prevention of a disease. The FDA seeks to review NDAs that are granted priority status more quickly than NDAs given standard review status. The FDA's stated policy is to act on 90% of priority NDAs
within six months of receipt. Although the FDA historically has not met these goals, the agency has made significant improvements in the timeliness of the review process.

We
and any of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with applicable FDA current good manufacturing practice regulations. Good manufacturing practices include
requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as to corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the
applicable regulatory authorities. These facilities, whether our own or our contract manufacturers, must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our related products. We or
our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with applicable good manufacturing practices and FDA or other regulatory requirements. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply, we or
our contract manufacturers may be subject to legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, or voluntary recall of product. Furthermore, continued compliance with
applicable good manufacturing practices will require continual expenditure of time, money and effort on the part of us or our contract manufacturers in the areas of production and quality control and
record keeping and reporting, in order to ensure full compliance.

Outside
the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing
the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national
level, although within the European Union, or EU, centralized registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. If the regulatory
authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This foreign



regulatory
approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above and may also include additional risks.

The
Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the
time of application for orphan drug designation. The first developer to receive FDA marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the United States
for that product. However, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in
the United States during the seven year exclusive marketing period. We believe that the commercial success of any orphan drug product that we may commercialize depends more significantly on the
associated safety and efficacy profile and on the price relative to competitive or alternative treatments and other marketing characteristics of the product than on the exclusivity afforded by the
Orphan Drug Act. Additionally, these products may be protected by patents and other means.

Legislation
similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United States, including the European Union. The orphan legislation in the European Union is
available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at
the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product does not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Incyte's Transition into Small-Molecule Drug Discovery and Development

Before the completion of our transition into a drug discovery and development company, we marketed and sold access to our genomic
information databases. However, in recent years, consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and a challenging economic environment led to reduced demand for research tools and
services. This trend, together with the public availability of genomic information, significantly reduced the market for and revenues from, our information products.

On
February 2, 2004, we announced substantial changes in our information products operations, including the closure of our Palo Alto, California facility and the cessation of
development of the information products developed at this facility. In January 2005, we sold certain assets and liabilities related to our Proteome facility based in Beverly, Massachusetts. We no
longer have any activities in the information products area. However, we retain certain existing licenses and licensing activities related to the intellectual property portfolio generated prior to the
transition.

Research and Development

Since our inception, we have made substantial investments in research and technology development. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
incurred research and development expenses of $146.4 million, $104.9 million and $87.6 million, respectively.

Human Resources

As of December 31, 2008, we had 212 employees, including 172 in research and development and 40 in operations support, finance
and administrative positions. Of these employees, 79 employees have advanced technical degrees including 9 MD's and 70 Ph.D's. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements,
and management considers relations with our employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS

We are at the early stage of our drug discovery and development efforts and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts.

We are in the early stage of building our drug discovery and development operations. Our ability to discover, develop and commercialize
pharmaceutical products will depend on our ability to:

•

hire and retain key scientific employees;

•

identify high quality therapeutic targets;

•

identify potential drug candidates;

•

develop products internally or license drug candidates from others;

•

identify and enroll suitable human subjects, either in the United States or abroad, for our clinical trials;

•

complete laboratory testing and clinical trials on humans;

•

obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products;

•

obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our products, both in the United States and abroad;

•

enter into arrangements with third parties to provide services or to manufacture our products on our behalf;

•

deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions;

•

lease facilities at reasonable rates to support our growth; and

•

enter into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products.

We
have limited experience with the activities listed above and may not be successful in discovering, developing, or commercializing drug products.

Our efforts to discover and develop potential drug candidates may not lead to the discovery, development, commercialization or marketing of drug products.

Our drug candidates in clinical trials are in Phase I and Phase II trials. Our other drug candidates are still undergoing
preclinical testing. We have also licensed to Pfizer our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We have no control over the further clinical development of any compounds we licensed to Pfizer.
Discovery and development of potential drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates that can be
successfully developed and marketed. If our efforts do not lead to the discovery of a suitable drug candidate, we may be unable to grow our clinical pipeline or we may be unable to enter into
agreements with collaborators who are willing to develop our drug candidates. Of the compounds that we identify as potential drug products or that we in-license from other companies, only
a few, if any, are likely to lead to successful drug development programs. For example, in 2006, we discontinued the development of DFC, which was at the time our most advanced drug candidate and was
in Phase IIb clinical trials. Prior to discontinuation of the DFC program, we expended a significant amount of effort and money on that program.



The success of our drug discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully exploit our capabilities. If we are unable to
establish collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

An important element of our business strategy will be to enter into collaborative or license arrangements with other parties, such as
our collaboration with Pfizer, under which we license our drug candidates to those parties for development and commercialization. We expect that while we plan to conduct initial clinical trials on our
drug candidates, we may need to seek collaborators for our drug candidates such as our chemokine receptor antagonists because of the expense, effort and expertise required to continue additional
clinical trials and further develop those drug candidates. We may also seek collaborators for our drug candidates that target large primary care indications such as diabetes because of the expense
involved in further clinical development of these indications and in establishing a sales and marketing organization to address these indications. Because collaboration arrangements are complex to
negotiate, we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements. Also, we may not have drug compounds that are desirable to other parties, or we may be unwilling to license a drug
compound because the party interested in it is a competitor. The terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. Alternatively, potential collaborators may decide against
entering into an agreement with us because of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or for scientific, commercial or other reasons. If we are not able to establish collaborative
agreements, we may not be able to develop and commercialize a drug product, which would adversely affect our business and our revenues.

In
order for any of these collaboration or license arrangements to be successful, we must first identify potential collaborators or licensees whose capabilities complement and integrate
well with ours. We may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources, but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials,
manufacturing, sales and marketing, and for licenses to technology rights. However, it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or
licensees devote to our programs or potential products. If our collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are less skilled than we originally expected or do not devote adequate resources
to the program, the relationship will not be successful. If a business combination involving a collaborator or licensees and a third party were to occur, the effect could be to diminish, terminate or
cause delays in development of a potential product.

We face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts, and if we do not compete effectively, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or
eliminated.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
Our drug discovery and development efforts may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing therapies or that are being developed by our competitors, many of which have
substantially greater resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, more experience in completing preclinical testing and clinical trials, and formulation, marketing and
manufacturing capabilities. As a result of these resources, our competitors may develop drug products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive by developing more effective drugs or by
developing their products more efficiently. Our ability to develop competitive products would be limited if our competitors succeeded in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly
than we were able to or in obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limited our drug development efforts. Any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts,
or from our joint efforts with collaborators or licensees, might not be able to compete successfully with our competitors' existing and future products, or obtain regulatory approval in the United
States or elsewhere.



We depend on our collaboration with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of CCR2 antagonist compounds.

Under our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer, Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to
our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides.

Although
Pfizer is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CCR2 antagonists for the indications for which they are responsible, we cannot control the
amount and timing of resources Pfizer may devote to the development of CCR2 antagonists. Any failure of Pfizer to perform its obligations under our agreement could negatively impact the development of
CCR2 antagonists, lead to our loss of potential revenues from product sales and milestones and delay our achievement, if any, of profitability.

Pfizer
has certain rights to terminate the license agreement, including the right to terminate upon 90 days' notice for any reason. Pfizer also has the right to terminate its
rights and obligations with respect to certain indications and licensed compounds. If Pfizer terminates the license agreement or its rights with respect to certain indications, we may not be able to
find a new collaborator to replace Pfizer, and our business could be adversely affected.

If conflicts arise between our collaborators, including Pfizer, licensees, or advisors and us, our collaborators, licensees, or advisors may act in their
self-interest, which may adversely affect our business.

If conflicts arise between us and our collaborators or licensees, including Pfizer, or our scientific advisors, the other party may act
in its self-interest and not in the interest of our stockholders. Conflicts may arise with our collaborators or licensees if they pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative
products either on their own or in collaboration with others as a means for developing treatments for the diseases that we have targeted. Competing products, either developed by these future
collaborators or licensees or to which these future collaborators or licensees have rights, may result in their withdrawal of support for our product candidates.

Additionally,
conflicts may arise if there is a dispute about the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the
course of the relationship. Similarly, the parties to a collaboration or license agreement may disagree as to which party owns newly developed products. Should an agreement be terminated as a result
of a dispute and before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration or license, our reputation could be harmed and we may not obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving.

We have limited expertise with and capacity to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials, and our resulting dependence on other parties could result in delays in and
additional costs for our drug development efforts.

We have only limited experience with clinical trials, formulation, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. We also have
limited internal resources and capacity to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials. As a result, we intend to continue to hire clinical research organizations, or CROs, to perform preclinical
testing and clinical trials for drug candidates. If the CROs that we hire to perform our preclinical testing and clinical trials or our collaborators or licensees do not meet deadlines, do not follow
proper procedures, or a conflict arises between us and our CROs, our preclinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may be delayed or may be terminated. If we were forced to
find a replacement entity to perform any of our preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to find another
company to perform a preclinical test or clinical trial, the delay in the test or trial may result in significant additional expenditures. Events such as these may result in delays in our obtaining
regulatory approval for



our
drug candidates or our ability to commercialize our products and could result in increased expenditures that would adversely affect our operating results.

In
addition, for some of our drug candidates, we plan to contract with collaborators or licensees to advance those candidates through later-stage, more expensive clinical trials, rather
than invest our own resources to perform these clinical trials. Depending on the terms of our agreements with these collaborators or licensees, we may not have any control over the conduct of these
clinical trials, and in any event we would be subject to the risks associated with depending on collaborators or licensees to develop these drug candidates.

If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to develop and market products in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we will not be permitted to manufacture or
commercialize products resulting from our research.

In order to manufacture and commercialize drug products in the United States, our drug candidates will have to obtain regulatory
approval from the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years. To obtain regulatory approval, we must first show that our drug products
are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical testing (animal testing) and clinical trials (human testing). Preclinical testing and clinical development are long, expensive and
uncertain processes, and we do not know whether the FDA will allow us to undertake clinical trials of any potential drug products in addition to our compounds currently in clinical trials.

Completion
of clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of testing. The length of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity,
novelty and intended use of the product candidate. Interim results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early clinical trials may
not be repeated in later clinical trials. For example, a drug candidate that is successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or dangerous side effects when tested at the clinical level. Our
rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:

•

the high degree of risk associated with drug development;

•

our inability to formulate or manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;

•

variability in the number and types of patients available for each study;

•

difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;

•

unforeseen safety issues or side effects;

•

poor or unanticipated effectiveness of drug candidates during the clinical trials; or

•

government or regulatory delays.

Regulatory
authorities may delay or prevent the initiation of clinical trials for our drug candidates. For example, we may be unable to successfully complete discussions with the FDA
regarding trial design, including agreement on appropriate dosing and specific endpoints, for the registration trials for our JAK inhibitor for myelofibrosis.

Data
obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry,
including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, regulatory
authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of other factors, such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory agency review. For example, the FDA
has in the past required and could in the future require that we conduct additional trials of any of our product candidates, which would result in delays.



Due,
in part, to the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process, we cannot predict whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product we develop. Our
drug candidates in clinical trials are in Phase I and Phase II trials. Our other drug candidates are still undergoing preclinical testing. We have also licensed to Pfizer our portfolio
of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We have no control over the further clinical development of any compounds we licensed to Pfizer. Compounds developed by us, alone or with other parties, may not prove to
be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, this
approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective. Failure to obtain regulatory approval would
delay or prevent us from commercializing products.

Outside
the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. This foreign regulatory
approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above and may also include additional risks. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical
trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform additional testing and expend additional resources. Approval by the FDA does not
ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA.

We may not obtain a special protocol assessment for our JAK inhibitor for myelofibrosis. A special protocol assessment does not guarantee any particular outcome from
regulatory review, including any regulatory approval.

We have filed a request with the FDA for a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for the registration trials for our JAK inhibitor for
myelofibrosis. The SPA process allows for FDA evaluation of a clinical trial protocol intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in support of a new drug application, or NDA, and provides
a product sponsor with an agreement confirming that the design and size of the trial will be appropriate to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim for an NDA if the trial is performed according
to the SPA. However, an SPA must be agreed to by the FDA before a trial conducted under an SPA can be initiated, and there is no guarantee that an SPA would be agreed to on a timely basis.
Accordingly, if we submit a request for an SPA, the initiation of this trial may be delayed. If we believe that the submission of a request for an SPA or the failure to reach agreement on an SPA will
significantly delay the initiation of this trial, we may determine not to revise an SPA request in an attempt to reach agreement with the FDA or to proceed with the trial and not to wait for agreement
on an SPA. Without the FDA's concurrence on an SPA, we cannot be certain that the design, conduct and data analysis approach for this clinical trial will be sufficient to allow us to submit or receive
approval of a JAK inhibitor for the treatment of myelofibrosis.

An
SPA is not a guarantee of approval, and we cannot be certain that the design of, or data collected from, the trial will be adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy, or otherwise be
sufficient to support regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that the terms of an SPA will ultimately be binding on the FDA, and the FDA is not obligated to approve an NDA, if any, even if the
clinical outcome is positive. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA and the data and results from a clinical trial, and can require trial design
changes if issues arise essential to determining safety or efficacy. In addition, data may subsequently become available that causes the FDA to reconsider the previously agreed upon scope of review
and the FDA may have subsequent safety or efficacy concerns that override an SPA, and we can give no assurance that as clinical trials proceed or as part of an NDA review process, if any, the FDA will
determine that a previously approved SPA is still valid.

Additionally,
an SPA may be changed only with written agreement of the FDA, and any further changes we may propose to the protocol will remain subject to the FDA's approval. The FDA may
not agree to any such an amendment and, even if they agree, they may request other amendments to the trial



design
that could require additional cost and time, as well as increase the degree of difficulty in reaching clinical endpoints. As a result, even with an SPA, we cannot be certain that the trial
results will be found to be adequate to support an efficacy claim and product approval.

Our reliance on other parties to manufacture our drug candidates could result in a short supply of the drugs, delays in clinical trials or drug development, increased costs
and withdrawal or denial of the regulatory authority's approval.

We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our drug candidates. We expect to
continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates and any drug products that we may develop. The FDA requires that drug products be manufactured according to its current
Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations and a limited number of manufacturers comply with these requirements. If the other parties that we choose to manufacture our drug products are not
compliant with cGMP, the FDA may not approve our application to manufacture our drug products. We may not be able to arrange for our drug candidates or any drug products that we may develop to be
manufactured by one of these parties on reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our products could result in the FDA withdrawing or denying regulatory approval
of our drug product or other enforcement actions.

We
may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our drug candidates or any drug products we may develop if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or capability to
manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. Also, raw materials that may be required to manufacture any products we develop may only be available from a limited number of
suppliers. If we have promised delivery of a new product and are unable to meet the delivery requirement due to manufacturing difficulties, our development programs would be delayed, and we may have
to expend additional sums in order to ensure that manufacturing capacity is available when we need it even if we do not use all of the manufacturing capacity. This expense would adversely affect our
operating results.

Manufacturers
of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, especially in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production
costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We may not be able to
adequately manage and oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. Foreign manufacturing approval processes typically include all
of the risks associated with the FDA approval process for manufacturing and may also include additional risks.

We may incur additional expense in order to market our drug products.

We do not have experience marketing drug products. If the FDA grants regulatory approval to one or more of our drug candidates, we
would have to employ additional personnel or engage another party to market our drug products, which would be an additional expense to us.

We might not be able to commercialize our drug candidates successfully, and we may spend significant time and money attempting to do so.

We have a limited number of drug candidates in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. We have also licensed to Pfizer our
portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We, or our collaborators or licensees, may decide to discontinue development of any or all of our drug candidates at any time for commercial, scientific or
other reasons. We discontinued development of DFC in April 2006 for safety reasons. In March 2008, we announced that we would not advance our lead CCR5 antagonist into Phase IIb trials and that
we are seeking to out-license this program. If a product is developed, but is not marketed, we may have spent significant amounts of time and money on it, which would adversely affect our
operating results and financial condition. Even if a drug candidate that we develop receives regulatory approval, we may



decide
not to commercialize it if we determine that commercialization of that product would require more money and time than we are willing to invest. For example, drugs that receive approval are
subject to post-regulatory surveillance and may have to be withdrawn from the market if previously unknown side effects occur. At this point, the regulatory agencies may require additional
clinical trials or testing. Once a drug is marketed, if it causes side effects, the drug product may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling, warnings
to the public and negative publicity. As a result, we may not continue to commercialize a product even though it has obtained regulatory approval. Further, we may decide not to continue to
commercialize a product if the market does not accept the product because it is too expensive and third parties such as insurance companies or Medicare have not approved it for substantial
reimbursement. In addition, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if another product comes on the market that is as effective but has fewer side effects. There is also a risk that
competitors may develop similar or superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our products.

If we fail to enter into additional licensing agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our business and operations might be adversely affected.

In addition to establishing collaborative or license arrangements under which other parties license our drug candidates for development
and commercialization, we may also need to license drug delivery or other technology in order to continue to develop our drug candidate pipeline. If we are unable to enter into additional agreements
to license drug delivery technology or other technology or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts could be adversely affected.

Our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from payors of healthcare costs.

The continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and other payors of healthcare
costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative or
license partners and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United
States, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care
reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted,
the announcement or adoption of these proposals could reduce the price that we or any of our collaborators or licensees receive for any products in the future.

Our
ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are
obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and
services. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health
care services and products, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products. The cost
containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.



As our drug discovery and development operations are conducted at our headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the loss of access to this facility would negatively impact our
business.

Our facility in Wilmington, Delaware is our headquarters and is also where we conduct all of our drug discovery operations and research
and development activities. Our lease contains provisions that provide for its early termination upon the occurrence of certain events of default or upon a change of control. Further, our headquarters
facility is located in a large research and development complex that may be temporarily or permanently shutdown if certain environmental or other hazardous conditions were to occur within the complex.
In addition, actions of activists opposed to aspects of pharmaceutical research may disrupt our experiments or our ability to access or use our facilities. The loss of access to or use of our
Wilmington, Delaware, facility, either on a temporary or permanent basis, or early termination of our lease would result in an interruption of our business and, consequently, would adversely affect
the advancement of our drug discovery and development programs and our overall business.

We depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel, and the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain
additional personnel would affect our ability to expand our drug discovery and development programs and achieve our objectives.

We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management, operations and scientific staff. We experience intense competition
for qualified personnel. Our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team, key scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit, train
and retain essential scientific personnel for our drug discovery and development programs, including those who will be responsible for overseeing our preclinical testing and clinical trials as well as
for the establishment of collaborations with other companies. If we lose the services of any of these people or if we are unable to recruit sufficient qualified personnel, our research and product
development goals, including the identification and establishment of key collaborations, operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed. We do not maintain "key person" insurance on
any of our employees.

If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our ability to develop and commercialize products could suffer.

We expect that if our clinical drug candidates continue to progress in development, we continue to build our development organization
and our drug discovery efforts continue to generate drug candidates, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management and resources. Our ability to commercialize our drug
candidates and to achieve our research and development objectives depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization, systems and controls to
accommodate additional anticipated growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business could be harmed and our ability to execute our business strategy could suffer.

If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products and our results of
operations could be harmed.

The clinical trials and marketing of medical products that are intended for human use entails an inherent risk of product liability. If
any product that we or any of our collaborators or licensees develops causes or is alleged to cause injury or is found to be unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing or sale, we may be held
liable. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities, including substantial damages to be paid to the plaintiffs and legal costs,
or we may be required to limit commercialization of our products. Our product liability insurance policy that provides coverage for liabilities arising from our clinical trials may not fully cover our
potential liabilities. In addition, we may determine that we should increase our coverage upon the undertaking of new clinical trials, and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our
collaborators or licensees and may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product
liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with our collaborators. Additionally,



any
product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation, recall of products, participants to withdraw from clinical trials, and potential collaborators or licensees to seek other partners,
any of which could impact our results of operations.

Because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials, we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials that could
be time consuming and costly.

We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, handling,
storage and disposal of regulated substances and the health and safety of our employees. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and
biological waste resulting in the production of hazardous waste products. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these
materials. If any injury or contamination results from our use or the use by our collaborators or licensees of these materials, we may be sued and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and
our total assets. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators or licensees against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in
connection with these collaborations or licenses. Compliance with the applicable environmental and workplace laws and regulations is expensive. Future changes to environmental, health, workplace and
safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or may restrict our operations or impair our research, development and production efforts.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

We expect to incur losses in the future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

We had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through 2008. Because of those losses, we had an accumulated deficit
of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2008. We will continue to spend significant amounts on our efforts to discover and develop drugs. As a result, we expect to continue to incur losses in
2009 and in future periods as well.

We
anticipate that our drug discovery and development efforts and related expenditures will increase as we focus on the studies, including preclinical tests and clinical trials prior to
seeking regulatory approval, that are required before we can sell a drug product. The development of drug products will require us to spend significant funds on research, development, testing,
obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and marketing. To date, we do not have any drug products that have generated revenues and we cannot assure you that we will generate revenues from the
drug candidates that we license or develop for several years, if ever. We cannot be certain whether or when we will achieve profitability because of the significant uncertainties relating to our
ability to generate commercially successful drug products. Even if we were successful in obtaining regulatory approvals for manufacturing and commercializing a drug candidate, we expect that we will
continue to incur losses if our drug products do not generate significant revenues. If we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.

We will need additional capital in the future. The capital markets may not permit us to raise additional capital at the time that we require it, which could result in
limitations on our research and development or commercialization efforts or the loss of certain of our rights in our technologies or drug candidates.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our
business plan and research and development efforts going-forward. Additional factors that may affect our future funding requirements include:

•

any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs;

•

the results of research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trials conducted by us or our future
collaborative partners or licensees, if any;



•

the acquisition of technologies, if any;

•

our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations;

•

competing technological and market developments;

•

the amount of revenues generated from our business activities, if any;

•

the time and costs involved in filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims;

•

the receipt of contingent licensing or milestone fees or royalties on product sales from our current or future
collaborative and license arrangements, if established; and

•

the timing of regulatory approvals, if any.

If
we require additional capital at a time when investment in companies such as ours, or in the marketplace generally, is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions,
we may have to scale back our operations, eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborative partner that
would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates. For example, we recently decided not to advance compounds
from our c-MET and IDO programs into Phase I clinical trials until additional funding is obtained. If we are unable to raise funds at the time that we desire or at any time
thereafter on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to develop our potential drug products. The sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our
stockholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.

Our marketable securities are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our overall financial position.

We invest our cash in accordance with an established internal policy and customarily in instruments which historically have been highly
liquid and carried relatively low risk. However, with recent credit market conditions, similar types of investments have experienced losses in value or liquidity issues which differ from their
historical pattern. Should a portion of our marketable securities lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it could adversely affect our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to
fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise. Such financing, if available, may not be available on commercially attractive terms.

Our current revenues are derived from collaborations and from licensing our intellectual property. If we are unable to achieve milestones, develop products or renew or enter
into new collaborations, our revenues may decrease, and future milestone and royalty payments from our gene and genomics-related intellectual property may not contribute significantly to revenues for
several years, and may never result in revenues.

We derived substantially all of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 from our collaborative research and license
agreement with Pfizer and from licensing our intellectual property to others. We may be unable to enter into additional collaborative agreements. Revenues from research and development collaborations
depend upon continuation of the collaborations, the achievement of milestones and royalties we earn from any future products developed from our research. If we are unable to successfully achieve
milestones or our collaborators fail to develop successful products, we will not earn the revenues contemplated under our collaborative agreements. Part of our prior strategy was to license to our
database customers and to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our know-how and patent rights associated with the information we have generated in the creation of our
proprietary databases, for use in the discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical, diagnostic or other products. Any potential product that is the subject of such a license will require
several years of further



development,
clinical trials and regulatory approval before commercialization, all of which is beyond our control, and possibly beyond the control of our licensee. These licensees may not develop the
potential product if they do not devote the necessary resources or decide that they do not want to expend the resources to do the clinical trials necessary to obtain the necessary regulatory
approvals. Therefore, milestone or royalty payments from these licenses may not contribute to our revenues for several years, if at all. We have decided to discontinue some of our gene and
genomics-related patent prosecution and maintenance, and may in the future decide to discontinue additional gene and genomics-related patent prosecution and maintenance, which could limit our ability
to receive license-based revenues from our gene and genomics-related patent portfolio.

We have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.

As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate principal amount of total consolidated debt was $421.8 million and our
stockholders' deficit was $220.8 million. The documents pursuant to which our outstanding convertible senior and subordinated notes were issued do not limit the issuance of additional
indebtedness. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital and research and development
expenditures, and general corporate purposes;

•

requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and research and development expenditures;

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; or

•

placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better
access to capital resources;

In
the past five years, we have had negative cash flow from operations. We likely will not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to enable us to meet our
anticipated fixed charges, including our debt service requirements with respect to our outstanding convertible senior notes and convertible subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2008,
$151.8 million aggregate principal amount of our 3


/


% convertible senior notes due 2011 was outstanding. Our annual interest payments, beginning in 2007, for the


/


% convertible senior notes through 2010, assuming none of these notes are converted, redeemed, repurchased or exchanged, are $5.3 million, and an additional
$2.6 million in interest is payable in 2011. As of December 31, 2008, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2011
was outstanding. Our annual interest payments for the 3


/


% convertible subordinated notes through 2010, assuming none of these notes are converted, redeemed, repurchased or exchanged,
are $8.8 million, and an additional $4.4 million in interest is payable in 2011. As of December 31, 2008, $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
non-interest bearing convertible subordinated notes held by Pfizer was outstanding, of which $10.0 million is due in 2013 and $10.0 million is due in 2014. If we are unable
to generate cash from our operations or raise additional cash through financings sufficient to meet these obligations, we will need to use existing cash or liquidate marketable securities in order to
fund these obligations, which may delay or curtail our research, development and commercialization programs. We may from time to time seek to repurchase or refinance our outstanding convertible notes
that mature in February 2011. Repurchases might occur through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such
repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity



requirements,
contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any issuance of equity securities in
exchange for our outstanding convertible notes may be dilutive to our stockholders.

RISKS RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LEGAL MATTERS

If we are subject to arbitration, litigation and infringement claims, they could be costly and disrupt our drug discovery and development efforts.

The technology that we use to make and develop our drug products, the technology that we incorporate in our products, and the products
we are developing may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others. The success of our drug discovery and development efforts will also depend on our ability to
develop new compounds, drugs and technologies without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. We are aware of
patents and patent applications filed in certain countries claiming intellectual property relating to some of our drug discovery targets and product candidates. While the validity of issued patents,
patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain, if any of these patents are asserted against us or if we choose to license any of these
patents, our ability to commercialize our products could be harmed or the potential return to us from any product that may be successfully commercialized could be diminished.

From
time to time we have received, and we may in the future receive, notices from third parties offering licenses to technology or alleging patent, trademark, or copyright infringement,
claims regarding trade secrets or other contract claims. Receipt of these notices could result in significant costs as a result of the diversion of the attention of management from our drug discovery
and development efforts. Parties sending these notices may have brought and in the future may bring litigation against us or seek arbitration relating to contract claims.

We
may be involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights or contract violations. In addition, litigation or
other legal proceedings may be necessary to:

•

assert claims of infringement;

•

enforce our patents or trademarks;

•

protect our trade secrets or know-how; or

•

determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.

We
may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings. Regardless of the outcome, litigation or other legal proceedings can be very costly and
can divert management's efforts. For example, we settled patent litigation with Invitrogen Corporation in 2006. We incurred significant expenses related to this litigation and, as part of the
settlement, paid Invitrogen $3.4 million. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us or our
collaborators or licensees to seek licenses to other parties' patents or proprietary rights. We or our collaborators or licensees may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling a
drug or other product that we or they develop. Further, we or our future collaborators or licensees may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to
develop non-infringing technology or license technology on a timely basis or on reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.

We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary information, which may result in its unauthorized use, a loss of revenue under a collaboration agreement or
loss of sales to generic versions of our products or otherwise reduce our ability to compete in developing and commercializing products.

Our business and competitive position depends in significant part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including any
drug products that we create. Despite our efforts to protect this



information,
unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. For example, one of our collaborators may disclose proprietary information pertaining to our
drug discovery efforts. In addition, while we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to our product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries, our patent applications may
fail to result in issued patents. In addition, because patent applications can take several years to issue as patents, there may be pending patent applications of others that may later issue as
patents that cover some aspect of our drug candidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we may obtain may not be broad enough to protect our products or all of the potential uses of our
products, or otherwise prevent others from developing competing products or technologies. In addition, our patents may be challenged and invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive
advantages if, for example, others were first to invent or first to file a patent application for the technologies and products covered by our patents.

Additionally,
when we do not control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain important intellectual property, such as a drug compound in-licensed to us or
subject to a collaboration with a third party, the protection of the intellectual property rights may not be in our hands. If we do not control the intellectual property rights in-licensed
to us with respect to a compound and the entity that controls the intellectual property rights does not adequately protect those rights, our rights may be impaired, which may impact our ability to
develop, market and commercialize the in-licensed compound.

Our
means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may:

•

independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, products and techniques;

•

otherwise gain access to our proprietary information; or

•

design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property.

We
pursue a policy of having our employees, consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us. However, these agreements
may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. If we fail to maintain trade secret and patent protection,
our potential, future revenues may be decreased.

If the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the United States patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications, the value of our
patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased.

The value of our patents depends in part on their duration. A shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights
under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents. The United States patent laws were amended in 1995 to change the term of patent protection from
17 years from patent issuance to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the application. Because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications may be more
than three years depending on the subject matter, a 20-year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection. Also, we may need to refile some of our
applications filed before 1995 that claim large numbers of genes or other additional subject matter and, in these situations, the patent term will be measured from the date of the earliest priority
application. This would shorten our period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might derive from the patents.

International patent protection is particularly uncertain and costly, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries, we may have to expend
substantial sums and management resources.

Biotechnology and pharmaceutical patent law outside the United States is even more uncertain and costly than in the United States and
is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws.
For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the



treatment
of humans. We may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors' foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and
diversion of our efforts.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters is in Wilmington, Delaware, which is where our drug discovery and development operations are also located.
These facilities are leased to us until June 2010. We believe that these facilities are adequate to meet our business requirements for the near-term and that additional space will be
available on commercially reasonable terms, if required. In addition to this lease, we had lease agreements as of December 31, 2008 for facilities that were closed as a part of the
restructurings of our genomic information business in Palo Alto, California. As of December 31, 2008, we had multiple sublease and lease agreements covering approximately 255,000 square feet
which expire between June 2010 and March 2011. Of the approximately 255,000 square feet leased, approximately 136,000 square feet of this space is currently subleased to others.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial
Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Report.

Overview

Incyte is a drug discovery and development company focused on developing proprietary small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet
medical needs. We have a broad pipeline with programs focused primarily in the areas of oncology, inflammation, and diabetes.

Our
wholly-owned pipeline includes the following compounds:

We
anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and development programs. We also expect that losses will fluctuate from
quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial. Conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates in development is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. We
do not expect to generate product sales from our drug discovery and development efforts for several years, if at all. If we are unable to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over
the next several years, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted.



Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer

Effective in January 2006, we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") for the pursuit
of our CCR2 antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential
indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on
pre-clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the
agreement. Prior to such expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. In addition,
Pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. We received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40 million in January 2006 and are
eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007.

Restructuring Programs

In February 2004, we made the decision to discontinue further development of our information products line, close our Palo Alto
headquarters and focus solely on the discovery and development of novel drugs. We recorded $42.1 million in restructuring charges in 2004, including charges related to the closure of our
facilities, prior tenant improvements and equipment, a workforce reduction and other items. The restructuring charge originally included the present value of future lease obligations for two
facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we made a lease termination payment to satisfy our remaining lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities. The lease obligation for the second
facility extends through March 2011. As a result of the long term nature of the remaining lease obligation, we will be recording a charge each period through the March 2011 termination date of the
lease related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities

, which total approximately $0.4 million at December 31, 2008. The cash
impact in 2008 from restructuring related charges was $5.0 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on
historical experience and various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements:

•

Investments;

•

Revenue recognition;

•

Research and development costs;

•

Valuation of long-lived assets;

•

Restructuring charges; and

•

Stock compensation.



Investments.

We account for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. We carry our investments at their respective fair values. We periodically evaluate the
fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other-than-temporary impairment. This evaluation consists of a
review of several factors, including the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position, the existence of an event that would impair the issuer's future repayment
potential, the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market values recover, which may be maturity. If management
determines that such an impairment exists, we would recognize an impairment charge. Because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short-term investment
or marketable security prior to maturity, we classify our short-term investments and marketable securities as "available-for-sale." Investments in securities that
are classified as available-for-sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets, and unrealized holding gains and losses
for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized. We classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as
short-term investments. Those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated
balance sheet date are classified as long-term marketable securities.

Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered,
the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We have entered into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual
property. Revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. We exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably assured or that services
have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is
subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.

Revenues
from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period. Revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of
the related agreements. Royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We estimate royalty revenues based on
previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee. We exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for
us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon.

Under
agreements involving multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met,
including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When separate units of
accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from
historical sales of the
individual elements by us to other customers. If such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such
time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. When elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process,
revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. When revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, they are
recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.

In
connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006. The
$40.0 million upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, our estimated



performance
period under the agreement. In February 2006 and October 2007, Pfizer purchased, for a total of $20.0 million, a convertible subordinated note due 2013 and a convertible
subordinated note due 2014 (collectively, the "Pfizer Notes"). As the Pfizer Notes are non-interest bearing, they have been discounted to their net present value. The difference between
the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes, plus the related beneficial conversion feature, totals $3.2 million for each note, which represented additional consideration from
Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and have recognized it over our estimated performance period under the agreement. We recognized
contract revenues for research services provided by our full time equivalents to Pfizer in the periods in which the services were performed. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from
Pfizer in the second quarter of 2007. All milestone payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

Research and Development Costs.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 ("SFAS 2"),

Accounting for Research and Development Costs

, it is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred. We often contract with clinical
research organizations ("CROs") to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we
record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.

These
CRO contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event
that we prepay CRO fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development
services are performed in accordance with EITF 07-3,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and
Development Activities.

Most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the
contract period. These professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date.

Our
CRO contracts generally include pass through fees. Pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous
costs, including shipping and printing fees. We expense the costs of pass through fees under our CRO contracts as they are incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. The
estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the CROs, internal reviews and a review of
contractual terms. The factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical trial, estimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the
dosing regimen. CRO fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, which includes property and equipment as well
as intangible and other assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could indicate the need for an
impairment review include the following:

•

Significant changes in the strategy of our overall business;

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets;

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends;

•

Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and

•

Our market capitalization relative to net book value.

When
we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, in
accordance with FASB Statement



No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets

("SFAS 144"), we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to
determine if impairment exists. If impairment exists, we measure the impairment based on the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its fair value.

Restructuring Charges.

Costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after December 31, 2002, are accounted for
in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

("SFAS 146"). Costs associated with restructuring
activities initiated prior to December 31, 2002 have been recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3,

Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

("EITF 94-3")
and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

("SAB 100"). Restructuring costs resulting from the
acquisition of Maxia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Maxia") have been recorded in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3

, Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination

("EITF 95-3"). The restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs to exit facilities, reduce our
workforce, write-off fixed assets, and pay for outside services incurred in the restructuring. The workforce reduction charge is determined based on the estimated severance and fringe
benefit charge for identified employees. In calculating the cost to exit the facilities, we estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments, the future lease and
operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated, the amount, if any, of sublease receipts and real estate broker fees. This requires us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be
terminated, the amount of operating costs, and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site. To form our estimates for these costs, we perform an assessment of the affected
facilities and consider the current market conditions for each site. We also estimate our credit adjusted risk free interest rate in order to discount our projected lease payments in accordance with
SFAS 146. Estimates are also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that is being held for sale. These estimates are formed based on recent history of sales of
similar equipment and market conditions. Our assumptions on either the lease termination payments, operating costs until terminated, the offsetting sublease receipts and estimated realizable value of
fixed assets held for sale may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates. Our estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring us to record
additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities recorded.

At
the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy, that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are
for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans. We periodically evaluate current available
information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary. We also make adjustments related to accrued professional fees to adjust estimated amounts to actual.

Stock Compensation.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004)
("SFAS 123R"),

Share-Based Payment

, which revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 ("SFAS 123"),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payment transactions with employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values. SFAS 123R requires significant judgment and the use of estimates,
particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation.
SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $15.0 million,
$10.1 million and $8.9 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively.



Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007

We recorded net losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $178.9 million and
$86.9 million, respectively. On a basic and diluted per share basis, net loss from operations was $1.99 and $1.03 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our
contract revenues were $0.7 million and $29.8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contract revenues were derived from recognition of revenue associated with the
Pfizer $40.0 million upfront fee, recognition of revenue associated with the debt discount and beneficial conversion feature related to the Pfizer Notes, and research services provided to
Pfizer. The decrease from 2008 to 2007 primarily relates to completion in early 2008 of the amortization of the upfront fee received from Pfizer under our collaborative research and license agreement.
In addition, we received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer during 2007.

Our
license and royalty revenues were $3.2 million and $4.6 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. License and royalty revenues were derived from database subscriptions
and licensing of our gene- and genomic-related intellectual property. We expect that revenues generated from information products, including licensing of gene- and
genomic-related intellectual property, will decline as we focus on our drug discovery and development programs.

For
the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, revenues from companies considered to be related parties, as defined by FASB Statement No. 57 ("SFAS 57"),

We

development headcount. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted,



stock
price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. The increase in clinical research and outside services
from 2007 to 2008 is due primarily from the growth and advancement of our clinical pipeline. The decrease in occupancy and all other costs from 2007 to 2008 was primarily the result of decreased
depreciation costs.

Research
and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of preclinical and clinical trial-related activities.
Many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, the need to enroll additional patient
cohorts, adverse side effects among patients, the availability of supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical
trials. In addition, the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. These factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of
the further development and approval of our products.

Other expenses.

Other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $(0.2) million and $(0.4) million,
respectively.

In
2008, we recorded $(0.4) million of benefit in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $0.2 million of expense in connection with our 2002 restructuring program and
a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia. In 2007, we recorded $0.7 million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $0.9 million of benefit
in connection with our 2002 restructuring program and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia.

Other income (expense)

Interest and other income (expense), net.

Interest and other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007
was
$5.3 million and $22.4 million, respectively. The decrease in 2008 from 2007 was primarily attributable to the $8.5 million realized gain recorded from the sale of our investment
in a privately-held company in December 2007, a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates during 2008.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $24.9 million and $24.0 million,
respectively. The increase in 2008 from 2007 is primarily attributable to the increase in accretion of the discount related to the 3

Provision (benefit) for income taxes.

Due to our net losses in 2008 and 2007, we did not have an annual income tax provision.



Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

We recorded net losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $86.9 million and
$74.2 million, respectively. On a basic and diluted per share basis, net loss from operations was $1.03 and $0.89 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Pfizer. In addition, we received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer during 2007.

Our
license and royalty revenues were $4.6 million and $3.4 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. License and royalty revenues were derived from database subscriptions
and licensing of our gene- and genomic-related intellectual property.

For

Other expenses.

Other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $(0.4) million and $2.9 million,
respectively. The
decrease from 2006 to 2007 is due primarily to the settlement agreement with Invitrogen related to our discontinued genomic information business which resulted in a $3.4 million charge recorded
in other expenses in 2006. This settlement resolved all outstanding claims included in the litigation.

In
2007, we recorded $0.7 million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $0.9 million of benefit in connection with our 2002 restructuring program
and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia. In 2006, we recorded $1.0 million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $1.5 million of

in a privately-held company in December 2007 offset by a lower average cash balance during 2007. In 2006, we recorded a $6.2 million realized gain from the sale of our investment in
a publicly-held company offset by an impairment charge of $1.3 million recorded to reduce the carrying value of our investment in a privately-held investee.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $24.0 million and $17.9 million,
respectively. The increase in 2007 from 2006 is primarily attributable to the increase in accretion of the discount related to the 3

$8.2 million in 2007 compared to $2.1 million in the corresponding period of 2006.

Gain (loss) on redemption/repurchase of convertible subordinated notes.

In 2006 we redeemed $91.6 million principal amount of our
5.5%
convertible subordinated notes due 2007 (the "5.5% Notes"). The redemption resulted in a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes.

Due to our net losses in 2007 and 2006, we did not have an annual income tax provision.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. Accounting Principles Board 14-1,

(

"FSP No. APB 14-1"),

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
(Including Partial Cash Settlement)

. FSP No. APB 14-1 requires that the liability and equity components of



convertible
debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer's nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate. FSP No. APB 14-1 is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of APB 14-1 to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued EITF 07-5, "

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own
Stock

" ("EITF 07-5"). EITF 07-5 provides guidance in assessing whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is
indexed to an entity's own stock for purposes of determining whether the appropriate accounting treatment falls under the scope of SFAS 133, "Accounting For Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" and/or EITF 00-19, "Accounting For Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock". EITF 07-5 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008 and early application is not permitted. We have not yet determined what, if any, affect EITF 07-5 will have on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Sources and Uses of Cash.

Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have not been profitable and have generated
operating
losses since we were incorporated in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through 2008. As such, we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities, the issuance of
convertible notes, cash received from customers, and collaborative arrangements. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $19.8 million of marketable securities were classified as
long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet as they had been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and we have the intent and ability to hold them until the
carrying value recovers, which may be longer than one year. At December 31, 2008, we had available cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term marketable
securities of $217.8 million. Our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments including money market accounts, obligations of U.S. government
agencies, high-grade corporate bonds, and asset backed and mortgage backed securities. Available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives of
liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments. Recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on financial market activities including, among other things,
extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. We have assessed the
implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there had not been a significant impact to our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during 2008.

Cash used in Operating Activities.

The $48.2 million increase in cash used in operating activities from 2007 to 2008 was due
primarily to the
increase in our net loss. The $42.3 million increase in cash used in operating activities from 2006 to 2007 was due primarily to the $40.0 million nonrefundable upfront fee received from
Pfizer in January 2006.



Cash provided by Investing Activities.

Our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities,
have consisted
predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long-term investments. In the future, net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to
period due to the timing of strategic equity investments, acquisitions, including possible earn-out payments to former Maxia stockholders, capital expenditures and maturities/sales and
purchases of marketable securities.

Cash provided by (used in) Financing Activities.

During 2008, we received net proceeds of $101.7 million from the issuance of
common stock. In
addition, we received $3.2 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan. During 2007, in connection with the collaborative research
and license agreement, Pfizer purchased a $10.0 million Pfizer Note. In addition, we received $2.3 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee
stock purchase plan. During 2006, we issued a total of $151.8 million of 3


/


% Senior Notes, which resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $111.9 million. In addition,
we redeemed $91.6 million of the 5.5% Notes during 2006. In connection with the collaborative research and license agreement, Pfizer purchased a $10.0 million Pfizer Note in February
2006.

The
following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in
future periods (in millions):

The
amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations. We have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space
with scheduled payments to us of $2.7 million (less than 1 year) and $3.0 million (years 1 - 3); these scheduled payments are not reflected in the above
table.

The
table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events. The most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations
are summarized below.

Commitments
related to our acquisition of Maxia are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable. We completed our
acquisition of Maxia in February 2003. Under the merger agreement, former Maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of
$14.0 million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement. Twenty percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will be paid in cash and
the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million in our common stock (based upon the then fair
value) could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones. The milestones are set to occur as Maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time
prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger. In any event, no more than 13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to former Maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant
to the merger agreement. None of these milestones has been achieved as of December 31, 2008.



We
have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these
licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products.

We
believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our cash requirements depend on
numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with potential repayments of our 3


/


% Senior Notes, 3


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2011, and the
Pfizer Notes; expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; competing technological and market
developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative
agreements we may enter into, including the agreement with Pfizer; and expenditures in connection with alliances and license agreements. Changes in our research and development plans or other changes
affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources. We expect that future revenues generated from information products, including
licensing of intellectual property, will continue to decline as we focus on drug discovery and development programs, and in 2009, will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us. We
intend to continue to evaluate options to repurchase or refinance our outstanding convertible notes that mature in February 2011. Repurchases might occur through cash purchases and/or exchanges for
other securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any issuance of equity securities in
exchange for our outstanding convertible notes may be dilutive to our stockholders.

Until
we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or
private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations. The sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and
may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock. Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could
restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Recently, the credit markets and the
financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an
unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government. These events have generally made equity and debt financing difficult to obtain. If we are not able to secure additional
funding when needed, we may have to scale back our operations, delay or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a
collaborative partner that would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed under Contractual Obligations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our investments in marketable securities, which are composed primarily of investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. government agency debt
securities, mortgage and asset-backed securities and money market funds, are subject to default, changes in credit rating and changes in market value. These investments are also subject to interest
rate risk and will decrease in value if market rate interest rates increase. As of December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable
securities were $217.8 million. Due to the nature of these investments, if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of December 31, 2008 the
decline in fair value would not be material.

Interim Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited)




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Incyte Corporation as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at item 15 (a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Incyte Corporation, at December 31,
2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Incyte Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Business.

Incyte Corporation ("Incyte," "we," "us," or "our") is a drug discovery and development company focused on
developing
proprietary small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline with programs focused primarily in the areas of oncology, inflammation, and diabetes.

We
were founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1991. Until 2001, we devoted substantially all of our resources to the development, marketing and sales of information and genomic
products. We began our drug discovery and development activities in early 2002.

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Incyte Corporation and our wholly owned
subsidiaries. All
material inter-company accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States are measured using the local currency
as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, as appropriate. The resulting translation adjustments are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders'equity (deficit). Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of exchange.

Concentrations of Credit Risk.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade receivables, and long-term strategic investments
are
financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. The estimated fair value of financial instruments approximates the carrying value based on available market
information. We primarily invest our excess available funds in notes and bills issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and corporate debt securities and, by policy, limit the amount of credit
exposure to any one issuer and to any one type of investment, other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Our customers for our information products are primarily pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies which are typically located in the United States and Europe. We have not experienced any significant credit losses on cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities or trade
receivables to date and do not require collateral on receivables.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. banks or in custodial accounts with U.S. banks. Cash equivalents
are defined as
all liquid investments and money market funds with maturity from date of purchase of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash and have insignificant interest rate risk.

Marketable Securities—Available-for-Sale.

All marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices and observable inputs, with unrealized gains
and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity (deficit). We classify marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on the consolidated
balance sheets. Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six
months and (ii) we have the ability to hold them until the carrying value is recovered and such holding



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

period
may be longer than one year. The amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is
included in interest income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary for available-for-sale securities are included in "Interest and
other income (expense), net." The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Accounts Receivable.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007 we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an allowance for
doubtful accounts
based on experience and specifically identified risks. Accounts receivable are carried at fair value and charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is
unlikely and we cease collection efforts.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
recorded using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (generally three to five years). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the assets or lease term.

Certain
laboratory and computer equipment used by us could be subject to technological obsolescence in the event that significant advancement is made in competing or developing equipment
technologies. Management continually reviews the estimated useful lives of technologically sensitive equipment and believes that those estimates appropriately reflect the current useful life of our
assets. In the event that a currently unknown significantly advanced technology became commercially available, we would re-evaluate the value and estimated useful lives of our existing
equipment, possibly having a material impact on the financial statements.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

Long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangible assets, to be held and used are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable such as a significant industry downturn or a significant
decline in our market value. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of
impairment charges for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of such assets.
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. There have been no impairments
of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Long-Term Investments.

We have made equity and debt investments in a number of companies whose businesses may be complementary to our
business. Most of these investments were made in connection with the establishment of a collaborative arrangement between us and the investee company. Our long-term investments have
historically consisted of investments in both privately and publicly-held companies in which we have owned less than 20% of the outstanding voting stock and have not had the ability to
exert significant influence over the investees. Accordingly, our long-term investments in privately-held companies have been accounted for under the cost method and our
investments in publicly-held companies have been accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 115,

Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. Our investments in publicly-held companies are classified as available-for-sale and
are adjusted to their fair value each period based on their quoted market price with any adjustments being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of
stockholders' equity (deficit).



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

We
periodically evaluate the carrying value of our ownership interests in privately-held cost method investees by reviewing conditions that might indicate an
other-than temporary decline in fair value, including the following:

•

Financial performance of the investee;

•

Achievement of business plan objectives and milestones including the hiring of key employees, obtaining key business
partnerships, and progress related to research and development activities;

•

Available cash; and

•

Completion of debt and equity financings.

If
our review of these factors indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the investee has occurred, we estimate the fair value of the
investee. When the carrying value of our investments is materially greater than our pro-rata share of the estimated fair value of the investee, we record an impairment charge to reduce our
carrying value. Impairment charges are recorded in the period when the related triggering condition becomes known to management. We use the best information available in performing our periodic
evaluations; however, the information available may be limited. These evaluations involve significant management judgment, and the actual amounts realized for a specific investment may differ from the
carrying value.

Intangible and Other Assets.

Patent application costs relating to ongoing drug discovery and development are charged to expense as
incurred. In prior
years, costs of patents, patent applications and patent defense for gene and genomic patents were capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of
approximately five years in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17,

Intangible Assets

("APB 17").

Income Taxes.

Income taxes are accounted for using SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes.

Deferred income taxes are provided at the currently enacted income tax rates for the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and carry-forward items.
The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. In addition, valuation allowances are
established for deferred tax assets where the amount of expected future taxable income from operations does not support the realization of the asset. We believe that the current assumptions and other
considerations used to estimate the current year effective and deferred tax positions are appropriate. However, if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and
assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Financing Costs Related to Long-term Debt.

Costs associated with obtaining long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the
term of the related debt using the effective interest method.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share.

We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS 128"),

Earnings Per Share,

which requires us to present basic and diluted earnings per share. Our basic and diluted losses per share are calculated by dividing
the net loss by the



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during all periods presented. Options to purchase stock and convertible debt are included in diluted earnings per share calculations,
unless the effects are anti-dilutive.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the following:

Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered,
the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We have entered into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual
property. Revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. We exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably assured or that services
have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is
subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.

Revenues
from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period. Revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of
the related agreements. Royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We estimate royalty revenues based on
previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee. We exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for
us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon.

Under
agreements involving multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met,
including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When separate units of
accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from
historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. If such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is
deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. When elements are specifically tied to a separate
earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. When revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings
process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.

In
connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer"), we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $40.0 million
in January 2006. The $40.0 million upfront



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

fee
was recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, our estimated performance period under the agreement. In February 2006 and October 2007,
Pfizer purchased, for a total of $20.0 million, a convertible subordinated note due 2013 and a
convertible subordinated note due 2014 (collectively, the "Pfizer Notes"). As the Pfizer Notes are non-interest bearing, they have been discounted to their net present value. The
difference between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes, plus the related beneficial conversion feature, totals $3.2 million for each note, which represented additional
consideration from Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and have recognized it over our estimated performance period under the agreement.
We recognized contract revenues for research services provided by our full time equivalents to Pfizer in the periods in which the services were performed. We received a $3.0 million milestone
payment from Pfizer in the second quarter of 2007. All milestone payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

Research and Development.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 ("SFAS 2"),

Accounting for Research and Development Costs

, it is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred. We often contract with clinical
research organizations ("CROs") to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we
record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.

These
CRO contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event
that we prepay CRO fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development
services are performed in accordance with EITF 07-3,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and
Development Activities.

Most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the
contract period. These professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date.

Our
CRO contracts generally include pass through fees. Pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous
costs, including shipping and printing fees. We expense the costs of pass through fees under our CRO contracts as they are incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. The
estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the CROs, internal reviews and a review of
contractual terms. The factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical trial, estimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the
dosing regimen. CRO fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.

Other Expenses.

We recognize other expenses in connection with our plans to exit certain activities. In connection with our exit
activities, we
record other expenses for employee termination benefit costs, long-lived asset impairments, costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased, and other
exit-related costs. These charges were incurred pursuant to formal plans developed by management and accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

, ("SFAS 146"), EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

("EITF 94-3") and EITF Issue No. 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Business



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Combination

("EITF 95-3"). Fixed assets that are written off or impaired as a result of restructuring plans are typically held for sale or scrapped. The
remaining carrying value of such assets was not material as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The recognition of other expenses requires our management to make judgments and estimates regarding
the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity, including estimating sublease income and the fair value, less sales costs, of equipment to be disposed of.
Management's estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting
period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that they are adequate, that no excess accruals are retained, and that the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in
accordance with developed exit plans.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004)
("SFAS 123R"),

Share-Based Payment

, which revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 ("SFAS 123"),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payment transactions with employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values. SFAS 123R requires significant judgment and the use of estimates,
particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation.
SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $15.0 million,
$10.1 million and $8.9 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Staff Position No. Accounting Principles Board 14-1

(

"FSP No. APB 14-1"),

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
(Including
Partial Cash Settlement)

. FSP No. APB 14-1 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon
conversion (including partial cash settlement) be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. FSP No. APB 14-1 is effective
for us as of January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of APB 14-1 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued EITF 07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own
Stock

("EITF 07-5"). EITF 07-5 provides guidance in assessing whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is
indexed to an entity's own stock for purposes of determining whether the appropriate accounting treatment falls under the scope of SFAS 133,

Accounting For Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

and/or EITF 00-19,

Accounting For Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially
Settled in, a Company's Own Stock

. EITF 07-5 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early
application is not permitted. We have not yet determined what, if any, effect EITF 07-5 will have on our results of operations or financial condition.

Fair Value Measurements

We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 157("SFAS 157"),

Fair Value
Measurements

effective January 1, 2008. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ("the
exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the
consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. In determining fair value we use quoted prices and observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of
inputs as follows:

Level 1—Valuations
based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2—Valuations
based on observable inputs and quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities.

Level 3—Valuations
based on inputs that are unobservable and models that are significant to the overall fair value measurement.

We
have determined that our fair value requirements are in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 157, therefore, the implementation of SFAS 157 did not have any impact
on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our marketable securities consist of investments in corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury notes, and
other U.S. government agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. We classify marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on
the consolidated balance sheet. Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for
longer than six months and (ii) we have the ability to hold them until the carrying value is recovered and such holding period may be longer than one year.

As
of December 31, 2008, approximately $19.8 million of marketable securities were classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets as they
have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and we have the intent and ability to hold them until the carrying value recovers, which may be longer than one year.

Net
realized gains (losses) of $(1.6) million, $(0.4) million and $6.1 million from sale or impairment of marketable securities were included in "Interest and other
income/(expense), net" in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Note 3. Concentrations of Credit Risk

We previously had entered into agreements for information products and services, which include licensing a portion of our intellectual property, with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
agricultural companies and academic institutions. Such agreements represented 100% of license and royalty revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006. In general, customers agree to pay, during the term of the
agreement, fees to receive non-exclusive access to selected modules of our databases and/or licenses of certain of our intellectual property. In addition, if a customer develops certain
products utilizing our technology or proprietary information, we could potentially receive royalty and milestone payments. In November 2005, we entered into a collaborative research and license
agreement with Pfizer, which became effective in January 2006.

A
single customer contributed 34%, 87% and 88% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Three
customers comprised 78% and 68% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Note 4. Collaborative License Agreement

Effective in January 2006, we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the pursuit of our CCR2 antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and
commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune
nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on pre-clinical



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 4. Collaborative License Agreement (Continued)

development
candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement. Prior to such
expiration, either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. In addition, Pfizer may terminate the
agreement at any time upon 90 days' notice. We received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40 million in January 2006 and are eligible to receive additional
future development and milestone payments. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007.

We
determined that there were two deliverables under the agreement: (i) the worldwide license and (ii) our obligations in connection with a research plan (the "Research
Plan"), which were limited to completion of chemistry and biology research services on Pfizer's behalf by our full time equivalents (FTEs). We concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for
as a single unit of accounting and the $40 million upfront payment should be recognized as revenue over the two year term that we complete our obligations in connection with the Research Plan,
our estimated performance period under the agreement. We have no further substantive obligations to Pfizer after the completion of our obligations in connection with the Research Plan. All milestone
payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone. Consistent with the terms of the agreement and our original expectations at the inception of the agreement, the
Research Plan concluded after two years in January 2008 and, as such, there are no remaining substantive obligations to Pfizer under the agreement.

Contract
revenues related to the upfront consideration received, research services provided to Pfizer, and the difference between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer
Notes, of approximately $0.7 million, $29.9 million and $24.2 million were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In December 2007, we recorded a gain of approximately $8.5 million in interest and other income, net as a result of the sale of Velocity11, a privately-held life
sciences technology company in which we held an

ownership
position. In December 2008, we received additional consideration of approximately $0.9 million after the one year escrow period elapsed relating to this sale, which was recognized as
a gain in interest and other income, net.

In
June 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million in interest and other income, net to reduce the carrying value of our investment in a privately-held
investee because the investee had less than six months of cash and we believed that the likelihood of obtaining future debt or equity financing that would not result in an impairment was remote.

In
March 2006, we sold a portion of our investment in a publicly-held company accounted for under FASB Statement No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, for $11.5 million, and in October 2006, we sold the remaining portion of this investment for $5.8 million,
which resulted in a aggregate realized gain of $6.2 million in interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The
activity in our long-term investments, in any given period, may result in gains or losses on sales or impairment charges. Amounts realized upon disposition of these
investments may be different from their carrying value.

2004, we sublet one of our existing facilities to a third party. Under the terms of the consent agreement with the facility's landlord, we were required to obtain a letter of credit
in favor of the landlord in the amount of $2.6 million. The deposit and the related amount required under the letter of
credit declines monthly on a pro-rata basis through March 2011, the remaining term of the lease agreement assigned. The deposit is included in other assets at December 31, 2008.

approximately
$39.9 million. The carrying value of the 3

% Senior Notes is $131.0 million at December 31, 2008. The 3


/


% Senior Notes will accrete
up to their face value over the 53 month term of the notes by recording interest expense under the effective interest method.

In
connection with the collaborative research and license agreement, Pfizer purchased a $10.0 million principal amount Pfizer Note in February 2006 and an additional
$10.0 million principal amount Pfizer Note in October 2007. The Pfizer Notes bear no interest, are due seven years from the date of issuance and are convertible into our common stock at initial
conversion prices of $6.8423 and $9.75 per share, respectively, subject to adjustments. The Pfizer Notes are subordinated to all senior indebtedness, including the 3


/

and pari passu in right of payment with our 3


/


% Subordinated Notes. We may, at our option, repay the Pfizer Notes beginning February 3, 2009 and October 10, 2010,
respectively. Pfizer may require us to repay the Pfizer Notes upon a change of control, as defined. As the Pfizer Notes are non interest bearing, they have been discounted to their net present value
of $6.8 million each by imputing interest at a rate of 4.5% and 3.9%, respectively, which represented market conditions in place at the time the notes were issued. The carrying value of the
Pfizer Notes were $8.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. We will accrete the Pfizer Notes up to their face value over their term of seven years by
recording interest expense under the effective interest method. The difference between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes plus the related beneficial conversion feature totals
$3.2 million for each note, which represents additional consideration from Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and will recognize
it over our estimated performance period under the agreement. Contract revenues related thereto of approximately $0.2 million, $4.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, were
recognized for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

In
February and March 2004, in a private placement, we issued a total of $250.0 million of the 3


/


% Subordinated Notes, which resulted in net proceeds of
approximately $242.5 million. The notes bear interest at the rate of 3.5% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. The notes are subordinated to
all senior indebtedness, including the 3


/


% Senior Notes, and pari passu in right of payment with the Pfizer Notes. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an
initial conversion price of approximately $11.22 per share, subject to adjustments. Holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change in control, as defined. We may redeem the notes
beginning February 20, 2007.

Note 9. Other Expenses

The estimates below have been made based upon management's best estimate of the amounts and timing of certain events included in the restructuring plan that will occur in the future. It
is possible that the actual outcome of certain events may differ from the estimates. Changes will be made to the restructuring accrual at the point that the differences become determinable. The
accrual balances for the restructuring plans are included in accrued restructuring and other liabilities (long-term) in the consolidated balance sheets.

In February 2004, we announced a restructuring plan to close our information products research facility and headquarters in Palo Alto, California
and move our headquarters to our Wilmington, Delaware pharmaceutical research and development facility. The closure of the Palo Alto facility corresponded with terminating further development
activities around our Palo Alto-based information products line. The restructuring plan included the elimination of 183 employees and charges related to the closure of our Palo Alto
facilities, previously capitalized tenant improvements and equipment and other items. The lease commitment and related costs originally included the present value of future lease obligations for two
facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we made a lease termination payment to satisfy our remaining lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities. The lease obligation for the second
facility extends through March 2011. As a result of the long term nature of the remaining lease obligation, we will be recording a charge each period through the March 2011 termination date of the
lease related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 146,

In November 2002, we announced plans to reduce our expenditures, primarily in research and development, through a combination of spending
reductions, workforce reductions, and office consolidations. The plan included elimination of approximately 37% of our approximately 700-person workforce from our offices in Palo Alto,
California; Beverly, Massachusetts; and Cambridge, England and the consolidation of our office and research facilities in Palo Alto,
California. As a result, we recorded an expense of $33.9 million related to restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2002.

We
currently have one remaining lease related to an exited site that is due to expire in December 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized
additional charges of $0.2 million, $(0.3) million and $(1.5) million, respectively, primarily relating to this facility for lease expenses in excess of or less than amounts originally
estimated. We estimated the costs based on the contractual terms of agreements and current real estate market conditions. We may incur additional costs associated with these subleasing and lease
termination activities.

In accordance with EITF 95-3, we recorded a $2.9 million charge in 2003 related to restructuring costs for Maxia
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Maxia"), which consisted of workforce reductions and consolidation of facilities. We recorded employee termination costs of approximately $0.8 million for 28
employee positions. The job eliminations were completed in July 2003. We also recorded restructuring costs related to lease payments for property that has been vacated and other costs of
$2.0 million. In 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded additional charges of $0.0 million, $(0.6) million and
$(0.1) million, respectively, relating to facilities lease expenses in excess of amounts originally estimated. The operating lease related to the vacated facility expired in November 2008.

Note 10. Stockholders' Deficit

Preferred Stock.

We are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which was outstanding as of December 31,
2008 or
2007. The Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences and privileges of any preferred stock issued in the future. We have reserved 250,000 shares of preferred stock designated as
Series A Participating Preferred Stock for issuance in connection with our Stockholders Rights plan, which expired in accordance with its terms in September 2008.

Common Stock.

As of December 31, 2008, we had reserved a total of 21,318,678 shares of our common stock for future issuance
related to our
stock plans as described below.

On
August 6, 2008, we completed a public offering of 12,075,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $9.00 per share pursuant to an effective shelf registration
statement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $101.7 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.

Stock Compensation Plans.

Summaries of stock option activity for our stock option plans as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and
related
information for the years ended December 31 are included in the plan descriptions below.

1991 Stock Plan.

In November 1991, the Board of Directors adopted the 1991 Stock Plan (the "Stock Plan"), which was amended and
restated for issuance
of common stock to employees, consultants, and scientific advisors. Options issued under the plan are, at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, either incentive stock
options, non-statutory stock options or restricted stock units. The exercise prices of incentive and non-statutory stock options granted under the plan are not less than the
fair market value on the date of the grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted after February 2007 generally vest over three years, pursuant to a formula determined by our Board
of Directors, and expire after seven years. Options granted prior to February 2007 generally vest over four years, pursuant to a formula determined by our Board of Directors, and expire after ten
years. Certain options granted in 2002 vest pro rata monthly over three years and expire after ten years. In May 2007, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under



INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 10. Stockholders' Deficit (Continued)

the
Stock Plan from 22,350,000 to 25,350,000. In May 2008, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan from 25,350,000 to
29,350,000.

Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan.

In August 1993, the Board of Directors approved the 1993 Directors' Stock Option Plan (the
"Directors' Plan"), which was later amended. The Directors' Plan provides for the automatic grant of options to purchase shares of common stock to our non-employee directors. In June 2005,
our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan from 1,100,000 to 1,500,000.

Under
the Directors' Plan, each new non-employee director joining the Board will receive an option to purchase 35,000 shares of common stock. Additionally, members who
continue to serve on the Board will receive annual option grants for 20,000 shares exercisable in full on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. All options are exercisable at the fair market
value of the stock on the date of grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

On May 21, 1997, our stockholders adopted the ESPP. In May 2006, our stockholders approved an
increase in the
number of shares available for grant from 3,100,000 shares to 3,850,000 shares. In May 2008, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares available for grant from 3,850,000 shares to
4,600,000 shares. Each regular full-time and part-time employee working 20 hours or more per week is eligible to participate after one month of employment. We issued
442,749, 337,689 and 313,715 shares under the ESPP in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded stock compensation expense of
$0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, under SFAS 123R as the ESPP is considered compensatory under SFAS 123R. As of December 31, 2008,
945,735 shares remain available for issuance under the ESPP.

Note 11. Stock Compensation

We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations. We recognize the
stock compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. Prior to January 1, 2006, we followed APB Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock compensation.

We
elected the modified prospective method in adopting SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of
adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption using the same valuation method
(Black-Scholes) and assumptions determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as disclosed in
our previous filings.



INCYTE CORPORATION

Note 11. Stock Compensation (Continued)

Under
the provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $15.0 million, $10.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of stock compensation expense on our audited
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. We utilized the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value of the stock compensation
granted, with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The
risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Federal Reserve rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected life calculation is based on the observed and expected
time to the exercise of options by our employees based on historical exercise patterns for similar type options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the
period commensurate with the expected life of the options. A dividend yield of zero is assumed based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash
dividends.

Based
on our historical experience, we have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of 5% for our options. Under the true-up provisions of SFAS 123R, we will record
additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than we estimated, and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than we estimated.

The
amortization of stock compensation under SFAS 123R for the period after its adoption, and under APB Opinion 25 or SFAS 123 (pro forma disclosure) for the period prior
to its adoption was calculated in accordance with FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 28. Total compensation cost of options granted but not yet vested, as of December 31, 2008, was
$8.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of 3.04 years.

charged directly to additional paid in capital. Management believes the uncertainty regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets requires a full valuation allowance.

Note 12. Income Taxes (Continued)

As of December 31, 2008, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.06 billion. We also had federal and state research and development
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $45.0 million. The net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will expire at various dates, beginning in 2009 through 2028, if not utilized.
Utilization of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development
credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. We have not currently completed a study to assess
whether an ownership change has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our formation, due to the significant complexity and related cost associated with such study.
There also could be additional ownership changes in the future which may result in additional limitations in the utilization of these credits.

We
also had federal and state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $18.7 million that will expire beginning in 2009.

United
Kingdom. Export revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $0.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

Note 15. Defined Contribution Plan

We have a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering all domestic employees. Employees may contribute a portion of their
compensation, which is then matched by us, subject to certain limitations. Defined contribution expense was $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Note 16. Litigation

Invitrogen

In October 2001, Invitrogen Corporation ("Invitrogen") filed an action against us in the federal court for the District of Delaware,
alleging infringement of three patents. On June 15, 2006 we entered into a settlement agreement with Invitrogen pursuant to which we agreed to pay Invitrogen $3.4 million as a settlement
fee. This amount is included in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.

In
addition to the matter described above, from time to time we have been involved in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management's opinion, the
outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Note 17. Related Party Transactions

The following summarizes our related party transactions as defined by FASB Statement No. 57,

Related Party Disclosures

("SFAS 57"). In each of the transactions noted in which a director of Incyte was at the time of the transaction in some way affiliated with the other party to the transaction, such director
recused himself from voting on the related party transaction.

During
2000 and 2001 we purchased shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock of Genomic Health, Inc. ("Genomic Health") for an aggregate
purchase price of $6.0 million. In connection with the completion of its initial public offering on October 4, 2005, these shares were converted into common shares. Additionally as part
of its initial public offering, Genomic Health exercised an election under which we were required to acquire an additional $5.0 million of Genomic Health common stock. In March 2006, we sold
our initial investment for $11.5 million, and in October 2006, we sold the remaining portion of this investment for $5.8 million, which resulted in a aggregate realized gain of
$6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Julian C. Baker, one of our directors, is also a director of Genomic Health and holds shares, directly or beneficially, of both
companies.

On
August 6, 2008, we completed a public offering of 12,075,000 shares of our authorized but unissued common stock at a price to the public of $9.00 per share pursuant to an
effective shelf registration statement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $101.7 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. Entities affiliated with
Julian C. Baker, one of our directors and principal stockholders, purchased an aggregate of 1,100,000 shares of our common stock in this offering.

Note 18. Commitments

As of December 31, 2008, we had non-cancelable operating leases on multiple facilities and equipment, including facilities in Palo Alto, California and Wilmington,
Delaware. The leases expire on various dates ranging from June 2008 to March 2011. Certain leases have renewal options for periods ranging up to 5 years. Rent expense for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was approximately $4.8 million, $4.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2008, future non-cancelable minimum payments under operating leases, including leases for sites included in the restructuring programs were as
follows:

The
amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations. We have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space
with scheduled payments to us of $2.7 million (less than 1 year) and $3.0 million (years 1-3).

In
addition to the non-cancelable commitments included in the table above, we have entered into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make payments to the contractual
counterparties upon the occurrence of future events. We consider these potential obligations contingent, and have summarized all significant arrangements below.

Commitments
related to Maxia are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable. In February 2003, we completed our
acquisition of Maxia. Under the merger agreement, former Maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of $14.0 million upon the
occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement. Twenty percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent
will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million in our common stock (based upon the then fair value) could potentially be paid
pursuant to the earn out milestones. The milestones occur as Maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the
consummation of the merger. In any event, no more than 13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to former Maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement. None of these
milestones had been achieved as of December 31, 2008.

We
have entered into and intend to continue to seek to license additional rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these
licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products.

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not
applicable.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance
standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte Corporation

We
have audited Incyte Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Incyte Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Incyte Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Incyte Corporation as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2008 of Incyte Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
