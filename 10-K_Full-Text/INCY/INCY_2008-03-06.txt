Overview

Incyte is a drug discovery and development company focused on developing proprietary small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline
with programs in oncology, inflammation, diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Thus
far in our drug discovery and development activities, which began in early 2002, we have filed twelve Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) and have progressed eight
internally developed proprietary compounds into clinical development. Currently, four of these compounds have advanced into Phase II clinical trials. Our wholly-owned pipeline includes the
following compounds:

Our productivity in drug discovery is primarily a result of our core competency in medicinal chemistry which is tightly integrated with and supported by an experienced team of biologists
with expertise in multiple therapeutic areas. As a number of our compounds have progressed into clinical development, we have also built a clinical development and regulatory team. This team utilizes
clinical research organizations (CROs), expert scientific advisory boards, and leading consultants and suppliers in relevant drug development areas in an effort to conduct our clinical trials as
efficiently and effectively as possible while maintaining strategic control of the design and management of our programs.

Incyte's Approach to Drug Discovery and Development

To succeed in our objective to create a pipeline of novel, orally available drugs that address serious unmet medical needs, we have established a broad range of
discovery capabilities in-house, including target validation, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and pharmacological and ADME (absorption,
distribution, metabolism and excretion) assessment. We augment these capabilities through collaborations with academic and contract laboratory resources with relevant expertise.

We
select drug targets with strong preclinical or clinical validation in areas where we have the potential to generate either first-in-class molecules or
compounds that are highly differentiated from existing treatments.

Our
chemistry and biology efforts are highly integrated and are characterized by the rapid generation of relevant data on a broad and diverse range of compounds for each therapeutic
target we pursue. This process allows our scientists to better understand, in real time, the potency and selectivity of the compounds, how they are likely to be absorbed and eliminated in the body,
and to assess the potential safety of the compounds. We believe that this approach, along with stringent criteria for the selection of clinical candidates, will help us to select appropriate
candidates for clinical development and rapidly assess key characteristics required for success.

Given
our chemistry-driven discovery process, our pipeline has grown to encompass multiple therapeutic areas: oncology, inflammation, diabetes and HIV. While our productivity has created
a diverse pipeline, we conduct a limited number of discovery programs in parallel at any one time. This focus allows us to allocate resources to our selected programs at a level that we believe is
competitive
with much larger pharmaceutical companies. We believe this level of resource allocation, applied to the discovery process outlined above, has been critical to our success in our current programs, and
that it remains a meaningful competitive advantage.

Additionally,
in all of our programs we strive to generate a diverse and broad range of proprietary compounds which we believe enhances the overall probability of success for our
programs and creates the potential for multiple products.

Once
our compounds reach clinical development, our objective, whenever possible, is to rapidly progress the lead candidate into a proof-of-concept clinical trial
prior to initiating larger definitive Phase IIb clinical trials to quickly assess the therapeutic potential of the clinical candidate itself and its underlying mechanism. This information is
then used to evaluate the commercial potential of the compound and the most appropriate indication or indications to pursue.

Incyte's Development Teams

Our development teams are responsible for ensuring that our clinical candidates are expeditiously progressed from preclinical development and
IND-enabling studies into Phase I and Phase II development. To efficiently and effectively keep pace with the growth in our clinical pipeline, we have added new members to
the development teams by internal transfers and by recruiting new employees


with
expertise in drug development including clinical trial design, statistics, regulatory affairs, and project management. We have also built core internal process chemistry and formulation teams
using this same strategy. Our internal multi-disciplinary project teams also work with experienced external CROs with expertise in managing clinical trials, process chemistry, product formulation, and
the manufacture of clinical trial supplies to support our drug development efforts.

Clinical Pipeline

Our pipeline includes compounds in various stages of development in the areas of oncology, inflammation, diabetes and HIV. The following summarizes the status of
and rationale for our most advanced compounds.

JAK 2 Program for Inflammation, Hematologic Malignancies, and Solid Tumors

The JAK family is composed of four tyrosine kinases—JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2—that are involved in signaling triggered by a number of
cytokines and growth factors. JAKs are central to a number of biologic processes, including the formation and development of blood cells and the regulation of immune functions. Excessive signaling
through the JAK pathways is believed to play a critical role in a number of disease states, including myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), specifically myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera and
essential thrombocythemia, inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis, and certain other solid and liquid tumors. Additionally, many MPD patients have a mutation that is
associated with JAK2, V617F, as well as other JAK2 mutations, which result in increased JAK signaling and we believe further supports the hypothesis that hyperactivation of the JAK pathways is central
to these disorders. We believe inhibition of aberrant JAK signaling may have therapeutic value in treating these various diseases.

We
have discovered multiple potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK inhibitors that are selective for JAK1 and JAK2 from multiple distinct chemical scaffolds. Our lead JAK
inhibitor, INCB18424, is currently being developed as a treatment for several of these conditions, including MF, RA and psoriasis. A lead follow-on JAK inhibitor compound, INCB28050, is
expected to enter clinical trials in 2008.

Thus
far, our clinical trial results with INCB18424 include positive interim results from several Phase IIa clinical trials in MF, RA and psoriasis patients and the compound has
been well tolerated.

Myelofibrosis

In December 2007, we reported positive interim results involving 11 MF patients from a dose-escalation Phase Ib/IIa trial with orally administered
INCB18424. We also announced that we reached a maximum tolerated dose in this first Phase Ib/IIa trial and have expanded the study to include an additional 21 patients at this dose. If the compound
continues to be well tolerated and demonstrates comparable efficacy in additional patients, we intend to begin discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to define the potential
registration pathway for INCB18424 as a treatment for MF. Provided the FDA agrees with our development plan, our objective is to initiate these trials in the second half of 2008.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

In January 2008, we announced positive interim results from a 28-day Phase IIa dose-ranging trial using the oral formulation of
INCB18424 in six RA patients whose conditions were not well-controlled with their existing therapy. This trial is expected to involve a total of 48 patients with final results expected in
the first half of 2008. Provided these results are positive, we plan to begin a six-month Phase IIb trial in RA patients in the second half of 2008.


Psoriasis (Topical)

In September 2007, we announced positive interim results from a 28-day Phase IIa dose-escalation trial with topical INCB18424,
involving 24 patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. In this trial the compound was well tolerated with no adverse events reported at any dose administered and with rapid and
sustained improvement observed in all subjects. These results suggest that topical intervention in the JAK pathway could be an effective way to treat psoriasis. If the compound continues to be well
tolerated in the ongoing safety studies, we expect to begin a three-month Phase IIb trial in psoriasis using this topical formulation in the second half of 2008.

Refractory Prostate Cancer and Multiple Myeloma

We recently initiated Phase IIa clinical trials in refractory prostate cancer patients, as well as patients with multiple myeloma. Results from these
trials are expected in the second half of 2008.

We
intend to complete our IND-enabling studies and initiate Phase I clinical trials with our follow-on JAK inhibitor compound INCB28050 in
mid-2008.

11ßHSD1 Program for Type 2 Diabetes and Related Disorders

We have developed a broad chemically diverse series of novel proprietary oral inhibitors of 11ßHSD1, an enzyme that converts the biologically-inactive
steroid cortisone into the potent biologically-active hormone cortisol. Cortisol acts as a functional antagonist of insulin action in multiple tissue types, including the liver, adipose, skeletal
muscle, and pancreas. Inhibition of 11ßHSD1 offers the potential to reduce insulin resistance and restore glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, and may also offer potential benefits
in allied conditions such as dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease.

In
September 2007, we reported positive interim results from the ongoing 28-day Phase IIa placebo-controlled clinical trial in type 2 diabetes. In the patients
included in this interim analysis, we observed positive effects on multiple clinically relevant endpoints such as fasting plasma glucose and on dyslipidemia, including reduction of LDL, total
cholesterol and triglycerides. A three-month Phase IIb trial in type 2 diabetes is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2008.

For
INCB20817, our follow on 11ßHSD1 compound, the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) has been accepted and Phase I trials are expected to begin in the first
half of 2008.

HM74a for Type 2 Diabetes

HM74a is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed in adipocytes (fat cells). GPCRs are a large protein family of transmembrane
receptors that sense molecules outside the cell, activate signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. GPCRs are involved in many diseases, and are the target of many
existing drugs.

Agonism
of HM74a by niacin causes a reduction in circulating free fatty acids (FFA). It is known that elevated levels of FFAs are associated with an increase in glucose production and a
decrease in glucose uptake which leads to insulin resistance. While oral administration of niacin leads to a decrease in glucose production and an increase in glucose uptake, niacin treatments cannot
be used to treat insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics because these compounds have very short half-lives that lead to intolerance and discomfort such as cutaneous flushing.
Additionally, the short half-life of niacin treatments can cause FFA levels to rebound and actually lead to increased glucose level. In contrast to niacin containing treatments, our lead
HM74a agonist, INCB19602, which is in Phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers, does not appear to cause flushing and has resulted in profound and sustained reductions in FFA levels
without causing rebound. We therefore believe an HM74a agonist could prove to be an effective treatment for insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics without the adverse effect and


limitations
of niacin containing treatments. If the results from the Phase I trials continue to support development of INCB19602, we intend to begin a 28-day Phase IIa
clinical trial in type 2 diabetics in the first half of 2008.

CCR5 Antagonist Program for HIV

CCR5 is a major chemokine receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter CD4 cells, which are critical to the human immune system. CCR5 antagonists belong to a new
class of antiretrovirals known as HIV entry inhibitors. This new class includes various experimental compounds designed to block cell surface receptors, such as CCR5 or CXCR4, as well as other novel
compounds that block HIV fusion with the cell surface. Entry inhibitors work by blocking HIV before the virus enters the cell and begins its replication process. In contrast, existing HIV drugs such
as nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors work inside the cell and target the
proteins, reverse transcriptases and proteases that are involved in the replication of the virus.

Our
CCR5 antagonist program has yielded potent, selective, proprietary compounds with pharmacokinetic properties that have the potential to allow once-daily dosing without
use of ritonavir boosting, a key distinction from other CCR5 antagonists. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that is often used in combination with other drugs to improve or 'boost' the bioavailability
and cellular penetration of other drugs but which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This dosing profile is particularly attractive in patients who are in the earlier stages of disease,
where CCR5 is most prevalent, where the majority of regimens are once-daily (which improves patient compliance), and where ritonavir, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, is
less frequently used. Once-a-day dosing also offers the potential for the development of once-daily fixed dose combination formulations with other
anti-HIV medications.

We
have two CCR5 antagonists in development, INCB9471 and INCB15050. INCB9471 is the most advanced compound in this program. Thus far, from a 14-day Phase IIa clinical
trial, we have seen positive results demonstrating that once-daily dosing with INCB9471 offers sustained inhibition of viral replication. This suggests that INCB9471 may provide an
advantage over other CCR5 antagonists in development and other antiretroviral drugs that have shorter half-lives, less than 24 hours, especially in patients who are intermittently
non-compliant with their medications. Lack of adherence with drugs that have short half lives can lead to insufficient drug levels, which reduces the effectiveness of the drug regimen and
allows the virus to replicate. We are conducting several required drug interaction studies and completing longer-term safety studies with INCB9471 to support initiation of two
Phase IIb trials in treatment-experienced HIV patients.

Our
follow-on CCR5 antagonist, INCB15050, has completed Phase I development. While the results from the Phase I clinical trials suggest that INCB15050 also has
the potential to be a potent once-a-day treatment, based on the positive Phase IIa clinical trial data that we have seen with the lead compound, INCB9471, we do not plan
to advance INCB15050 beyond Phase I clinical trials at this time.

Sheddase Inhibitor Program for Solid Tumors

As the fundamental biology of cancer has been explored at the molecular level, new therapeutics are emerging that distinguish themselves from the classic,
relatively non-selective, cytotoxic agents. These new therapeutics are targeted specifically to pathways or proteins that are more critical for the growth of tumor cells than for the
growth of normal cells, thereby having the potential to provide a greater therapeutic benefit, both when used alone and in combination with cytotoxic agents. Currently available therapeutics of this
type have been shown to be effective in the treatment of certain important tumor types.


The
signaling pathways that utilize the receptors and ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family play a key role in the growth and survival of multiple tumor types,
including breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers. The EGFR, or HER, signaling pathways consist of four known cellular receptors: HER1 (also known as EGFR), HER2, HER3, and
HER4. Under normal conditions, these pathways are tightly regulated. However, in cancer, the pathways can become dysregulated and changes in the amount or the activity of HER family members, primarily
HER1, HER2 and HER3, have been shown to impact the growth, proliferation, migration, and survival of cancer cells. Sheddase is an enzyme that is believed to activate all four EGFR pathways.

Currently
approved therapies target one or more of the EGFR pathways. However, these currently available therapeutics may not block all EGFR family-mediated signaling, even in the tumor
types in which they are approved. In contrast, we believe our sheddase inhibitor targets all four EGFR signaling pathways and may provide meaningful advantages over therapies that target one or two.

We
have identified novel, potent, and orally available small-molecule inhibitors of sheddase that, in preclinical models, show efficacy as single agents and show synergy with other
targeted therapeutic agents and with cytotoxics. INCB7839, the lead compound from this program, is currently in Phase II development. The first of two Phase II trials has been initiated
and is designed to determine the effectiveness of INCB7839 when used in combination with Herceptin. A second Phase II trial in breast cancer patients is planned that will evaluate INCB7839 as a
monotherapy.

CCR2 Receptor Antagonist Program for Inflammatory Diseases

CCR2 is a key chemokine receptor found on monocytes that controls their migration into sites of inflammation. Once inside the monocytes differentiate into tissue
scavenger cells known as macrophages. In their normal role, macrophages scavenge foreign organisms or injured tissues; however, excessive or inappropriately triggered macrophage activity results in
the production of pro-inflammatory mediators that can cause damage to tissues and can lead to a chronic inflammatory response. There is substantial preclinical data from multiple academic
centers suggesting that CCR2 antagonism could be of therapeutic benefit in multiple sclerosis (MS). Activated macrophages accumulate in MS lesions, where they are associated with and presumed to be
required for the destruction of the myelin sheath, the protective coating around the nerves which disrupts nerve signaling and leads to loss of muscle control, vision, balance and sensation. Blocking
macrophage accumulation at these sites could thus lead to significant amelioration of this chronic and debilitating disease.

We
established a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer) in January 2006 in which Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights
to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We retained rights to certain CCR2 antagonists for MS and lupus nephritis and other autoimmune nephritides.

We
are pursuing MS first given the preclinical evidence suggesting that selective CCR2 antagonism has therapeutic potential in this disease. We have selected a lead clinical candidate,
INCB8696, and initiated a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers in 2007.

Discovery

We have a number of early discovery programs at various stages of preclinical testing, including two lead clinical candidates in oncology. We do not typically
disclose these programs and/or targets until we have successfully completed preclinical toxicology tests with the lead clinical candidate.


Commercial Strategy

We intend to develop and commercialize some of our compounds on our own in selected markets where we believe a company of our size can compete effectively, such
as oncology and certain inflammatory conditions. For programs that target large primary care indications such as diabetes, or require lengthy and expensive clinical development plans, we intend to
form strategic alliances with companies that have greater financial and commercial resources than we do, as we did with Pfizer for our CCR2 antagonist program.

Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer

Effective in January 2006, we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the pursuit of our CCR2 antagonist program. We received an
upfront nonrefundable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006. In addition, we received an aggregate of $20.0 million through the purchase of convertible subordinated notes,
$10.0 million in February 2006 and $10.0 million in October 2007, and we are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments of up to $740.0 million for
the successful development and commercialization of CCR2 antagonists in multiple indications, as well as royalties on worldwide sales. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer
in 2007. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds, the most advanced of which was in Phase IIa clinical trials in
rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-resistant obese patients at the time the agreement became effective in January 2006. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications, with the
exception of multiple sclerosis and lupus nephritis and other autoimmune nephritides, for which we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on
preclinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property

We regard the protection of patents and other enforceable intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our business and competitive
position. Accordingly, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright law, as well as nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual property. We have established a
patent portfolio of owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications that cover aspects of all our drug candidates, as well as other patents and patent applications that relate to
full-length genes and genomics-related technologies obtained as a result of our past high-throughput gene sequencing efforts. The patents and patent applications relating to
our drug candidates generally include claims directed to the drug candidates, methods of using the drug candidates, formulations of the drug candidates, and methods of manufacturing the drug
candidates. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries we believe that are commercially important to the development and growth of our business.

Patents
extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual
protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.

We
have a number of established patent license agreements relating to our gene patent portfolio and our genomics-related technology patent portfolio. We are presently receiving royalties
and other payments under certain of our gene and genomics-related patent license agreements. Under our gene patent license agreements, we may in the future receive royalties and other payments if our
partners are successful in their efforts to discover drugs and diagnostics under these license agreements.

We
may seek to license rights relating to compounds or technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may be required to pay
up-front fees, license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products.


Although we believe our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly
uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents in the United States or elsewhere from
pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be valid or enforceable or may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned
by or licensed to us or provide us with a competitive advantage. Any patent or other intellectual property rights that we own or obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our
competitors. Others may have patents that relate to our business or technology and that may prevent us from marketing our product candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. In
addition, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce patents, to protect our other intellectual property rights, to determine the scope and
validity of the proprietary rights of third parties or to defend ourselves in patent or other intellectual property right suits brought by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in such
litigation or other proceedings. An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liability.

With
respect to proprietary information that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality
agreements to protect our interests. While we require all employees, consultants and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our
trade secrets or other proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.

Competition

Our drug discovery and development activities face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. Our major competitors include fully integrated pharmaceutical companies that have extensive drug discovery efforts and
are developing novel small molecule pharmaceuticals. We face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with our potential products.

Many
companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs
than we do. In
addition, many competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in:

•

drug
discovery;

•

developing
products;

•

undertaking
preclinical testing and clinical trials;

•

obtaining
FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and

•

manufacturing,
marketing, distributing and selling products.

Accordingly,
our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval or commercializing products before we do. If we commence commercial product sales, we will
be competing against companies with greater manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience.


In
addition, any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise from:

•

other
drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease;

•

new
small molecules; or

•

other
classes of therapeutic agents.

Developments
by others may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative
arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to proprietary technology. These competitors,
either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing products that are more effective than ours.

Our
ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

•

develop
proprietary products;

•

develop
and maintain products that reach the market first, are technologically superior to and/or are of lower cost than other products in the market;

•

attract
and retain scientific and product development personnel;

•

obtain
patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;

•

obtain
required regulatory approvals; and

•

manufacture,
market, distribute and sell any products that we develop.

In
a number of countries, including in particular, developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs available at
a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major
pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for their drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit enforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in
those countries, and in other countries by importation from low-price countries, could be reduced by generic competition or by parallel importation of our product. Alternatively,
governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products in those countries, thereby reducing our
product sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products. In all of these situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Government Regulation

Our related ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and marketing of our potential small molecule products to treat major medical
conditions are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any drug developed by us must
undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates,
among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of these products. None of our
drug candidates has, to date, been submitted for approval for sale in the United States or any foreign market. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and
clinical trials of each drug candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and


clinical
data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication to establish a drug candidate's safety and efficacy. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of
substantial resources, involves post-marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. Before commencing clinical investigations in
humans, we must submit to, and receive approval from, the FDA of an IND application. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:

•

preclinical
laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;

•

submission
to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;

•

adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;

•

submission
to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, which must become effective before marketing can commence;

•

satisfactory
completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing
practices; and

•

FDA
review and approval of the NDA.

Similar
requirements exist within many foreign agencies as well. The time required to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary
substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.

Preclinical
testing includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the preclinical tests, together with
manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time,
the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND. In the latter case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA
concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

Clinical
trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols
detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and
each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board (IRB) before it can begin.

Clinical
trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the
investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion,
and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase II usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to:

•

evaluate
dosage tolerance and optimal dosage;

•

identify
possible adverse effects and safety risks; and

•

evaluate
and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications.

Phase III
clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical
evidence of efficacy and safety and providing an adequate basis for physician labeling. We cannot guarantee that Phase I, Phase II or


Phase III
testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including
a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies, including post-approval trials, may be required to provide additional data on safety and will be required
to gain approval for the sale of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA will require
post-approval reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand the indications for which the drug product may be
marketed. Further, if there are any requests for modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing facilities, a
supplemental NDA may be required to be submitted to the FDA.

Clinical
trials must meet requirements for IRB oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices. Clinical trials must be conducted under FDA oversight. Before receiving FDA
clearance to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the patient population that will be treated. If regulatory clearance of a product is granted, this
clearance will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical trials. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved
indication is prohibited. Furthermore, clearance may entail ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. Even if this
regulatory clearance is obtained, a marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. Discovery of previously
unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on this product, manufacturer or facility, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market.

The
length of time and related costs necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying
interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or cause the costs of these clinical trials to
increase, include:

•

slow
patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study, competition with clinical
trials for other drug candidates or other factors;

•

inadequately
trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials;

•

delays
in approvals from a study site's IRB;

•

longer
than anticipated treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or determine the appropriate product dose;

•

lack
of sufficient supplies of the drug candidate for use in clinical trials;

•

adverse
medical events or side effects in treated patients; and

•

lack
of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested.

Any
drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of
time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level, and at any time in the course of animal studies designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as
toxicological studies, or in clinical trials of our potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay
or abort the development of any of our drug candidates, and could ultimately prevent their marketing clearance by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.


The
FDA's fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening
diseases and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for these conditions. Under this program, the FDA can, for example, review portions of an NDA for a fast track product before
the entire application is complete, thus potentially beginning the review process at an earlier time.

We
cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant any of our requests for fast track designation, that any fast track designation would affect the time of review or that the FDA will approve
the NDA submitted for any of our drug candidates, whether or not fast track designation is granted. Additionally, FDA approval of a fast track product can include restrictions on the product's use or
distribution (such as permitting use only for specified medical procedures or limiting distribution to physicians or facilities with special training or experience). Approval of fast track products
can be conditioned on additional clinical trials after approval.

FDA
procedures also provide for priority review of NDAs submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, offer a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or
prevention of a disease. The FDA seeks to review NDAs that are granted priority status more quickly than NDAs given standard status. The FDA's stated policy is to act on 90% of priority NDAs within
six months of receipt. Although the FDA historically has not met these goals, the agency has made significant improvements in the timeliness of the review process.

We
and any of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with applicable FDA current good manufacturing practice regulations. Good manufacturing practices include
requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as to corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the
applicable regulatory authorities. These facilities, whether our own or our contract manufacturers, must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our related products. We or
our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with applicable good manufacturing practices and FDA or other regulatory requirements. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply, we or
our contract manufacturers may be subject to legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing,
seizure of product, or voluntary recall of product. Furthermore, continued compliance with applicable good manufacturing practices will require continual expenditure of time, money and effort on the
part of us or our contract manufacturers in the areas of production and quality control and record keeping and reporting, in order to ensure full compliance.

Outside
the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing
the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national
level, although within the European Union, or EU, regional registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. If the regulatory authority
is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks
associated with FDA approval discussed above and may also include additional risks.

Incyte's Transition into Small-Molecule Drug Discovery and Development

Before the completion of our transition into a drug discovery and development company, we marketed and sold access to our genomic information databases. However,
in recent years, consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and a challenging economic environment led to reduced demand for research tools and services. This trend, together
with the public availability of genomic information, significantly reduced the market for and revenues from, our information products.


On
February 2, 2004, we announced substantial changes in our information products operations, including the closure of our Palo Alto, California facility and the cessation of
development of the information products developed at this facility. In January 2005, we sold certain assets and liabilities related to our Proteome facility based in Beverly, Massachusetts. We no
longer have any activities in the information products area. However, we retain certain existing licenses and licensing activities related to the intellectual property portfolio generated prior to the
transition.

Research and Development

Since our inception, we have made substantial investments in research and technology development. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurred research and development
expenses of $104.9 million, $87.6 million and $95.6 million, respectively.

Human Resources

As of December 31, 2007, we had 196 employees, including 158 in research and development and 38 in operations support, finance and administrative
positions. Of these employees, 74 employees have advanced technical degrees including 8 MD's and 66 Ph.D's. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management
considers relations with our employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS

We are at the early stage of our drug discovery and development efforts and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts.

We are in the early stage of building our drug discovery and development operations. Our ability to discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products
will depend on our ability to:

•

hire
and retain key scientific employees;

•

identify
high quality therapeutic targets;

•

identify
potential drug candidates;

•

develop
products internally or license drug candidates from others;

•

identify
and enroll suitable human subjects, either in the United States or abroad, for our clinical trials;

•

complete
laboratory testing and clinical trials on humans;

•

obtain
and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products;

•

obtain
and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our products, both in the United States and abroad;

•

enter
into arrangements with third parties to provide services or to manufacture our products on our behalf;

•

deploy
sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions;

•

lease
facilities at reasonable rates to support our growth; and

•

enter
into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products.

We
have limited experience with the activities listed above and may not be successful in discovering, developing, or commercializing drug products.

Our efforts to discover and develop potential drug candidates may not lead to the discovery, development, commercialization or marketing of drug products.

Our drug candidates in clinical trials are in early stage Phase I and Phase II trials. Our other drug candidates are still undergoing preclinical
testing. We have also licensed to Pfizer our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We have no control over the further clinical development of any compounds we licensed to Pfizer. Discovery and
development of potential drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates that can be successfully
developed and marketed. If our efforts do not lead to the discovery of a suitable drug candidate, we may be unable to grow our clinical pipeline or we may be unable to enter into agreements with
collaborators who are willing to develop our drug candidates. Of the compounds that we identify as potential drug products or that we in-license from other companies, only a few, if any,
are likely to lead to successful drug development programs. For example, in 2006, we discontinued the development of DFC, which was at the time our most advanced drug candidate and was in
Phase IIb clinical trials. Prior to discontinuation of the DFC program, we expended a significant amount of effort and money on that program.


The success of our drug discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully exploit our capabilities. If we are unable to
establish collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

An important element of our business strategy will be to enter into collaborative or license arrangements with other parties, such as our collaboration with
Pfizer, under which we license our drug candidates to those parties for development and commercialization. We expect that while we plan to conduct initial clinical trials on our drug candidates, we
may need to seek collaborators for our drug candidates such as our chemokine receptor antagonists because of the expense, effort and expertise required to continue additional clinical trials and
further develop those drug candidates. We may also seek collaborators for our drug candidates that target large primary care indications such as diabetes because of the expense involved in further
clinical development of these indications and in establishing a sales and marketing organization to address these indications. Because collaboration arrangements are complex to negotiate, we may not
be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements. Also, we may not have drug compounds that are desirable to other parties, or we may be unwilling to license a drug compound because the
party interested in it is a competitor. The terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. Alternatively, potential collaborators may decide against entering into an
agreement with us because of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or for scientific, commercial or other reasons. If we are not able to establish collaborative agreements, we
may not be able to develop and commercialize a drug product, which would adversely affect our business and our revenues.

In
order for any of these collaboration or license arrangements to be successful, we must first identify potential collaborators or licensees whose capabilities complement and integrate
well with ours. We may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources, but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials,
manufacturing, sales and marketing, and for licenses to technology rights. However, it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or
licensees devote to our programs or potential products. If our collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are less skilled than we originally expected or do not devote adequate resources
to the program, the relationship will not be successful. If a business combination involving a collaborator or licensees and a third party were to occur, the effect could be to diminish, terminate or
cause delays in development of a potential product.

We face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts, and if we do not compete effectively, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or
eliminated.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our drug discovery and
development efforts may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing therapies or that are being developed by our competitors, many of which have substantially greater
resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, more experience in completing preclinical testing and clinical trials, and formulation, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. As a
result of these resources, our competitors may develop drug products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive by developing more effective drugs or by developing their products more
efficiently. Our ability to develop competitive products would be limited if our competitors succeeded in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we were able to or in
obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limited our drug development efforts. Any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts
with collaborators or licensees, might not be able to compete successfully with our competitors' existing and future products, or obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere.


We depend on our collaboration with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of CCR2 antagonist compounds.

Under our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer, Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2
antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides.

Although
Pfizer is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CCR2 antagonists for the indications for which they are responsible, we cannot control the
amount and timing of resources Pfizer may devote to the development of CCR2 antagonists. Any failure of Pfizer to perform its obligations under our agreement could negatively impact the development of
CCR2 antagonists, lead to our loss of potential revenues from product sales and milestones and delay our achievement, if any, of profitability.

Pfizer
has certain rights to terminate the license agreement, including the right to terminate upon 90 days' notice for any reason. Pfizer also has the right to terminate its
rights and obligations with respect to certain indications. If Pfizer terminates the license agreement or its rights with respect to certain indications, we may not be able to find a new collaborator
to replace Pfizer, and our business could be adversely affected.

If conflicts arise between our collaborators, including Pfizer, licensees, or advisors and us, our collaborators, licensees, or advisors may act in their
self-interest, which may adversely affect our business.

If conflicts arise between us and our collaborators or licensees, including Pfizer, or our scientific advisors, the other party may act in its
self-interest and not in the interest of our stockholders. Conflicts may arise with our collaborators or licensees if they pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products
either on their own or in collaboration with others as a means for developing treatments for the diseases that we have targeted. Competing products, either developed by these future collaborators or
licensees or to which these future collaborators or licensees have rights, may result in their withdrawal of support for our product candidates.

Additionally,
conflicts may arise if there is a dispute about the achievement and payment of a milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the
course of the relationship. Similarly, the parties to a collaboration or license agreement may disagree as to which party owns newly developed products. Should an agreement be terminated as a result
of a dispute and before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration or license, our reputation could be harmed and we may not obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving.

We have limited expertise with and capacity to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials, and our resulting dependence on other parties could result in delays in and
additional costs for our drug development efforts.

We have only limited experience with clinical trials, formulation, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. We also have limited internal resources
and capacity to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials. As a result, we intend to hire Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials for drug
candidates. If the CROs that we hire to perform our preclinical testing and clinical trials or our collaborators or licensees do not meet deadlines, do not follow proper procedures, or a conflict
arises between us and our CROs, our preclinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may be delayed or may be terminated. If we were forced to find a replacement entity to
perform any of our preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to find another company to perform a
preclinical test or clinical trial, the delay in the test or trial


may
result in significant expenditures. Events such as these may result in delays in our obtaining regulatory approval for our drug candidates or our ability to commercialize our products and could
result in increased expenditures that would adversely affect our operating results.

In
addition, for some of our drug candidates, we plan to contract with collaborators or licensees to advance those candidates through later-stage, more expensive clinical trials, rather
than invest our own resources to perform these clinical trials. Depending on the terms of our agreements with these collaborators or licensees, we may not have any control over the conduct of these
clinical trials, and in any event we would be subject to the risks associated with depending on collaborators or licensees to develop these drug candidates.

If we fail to enter into additional licensing agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our business and operations might be adversely affected.

In addition to establishing collaborative or license arrangements under which other parties license our drug candidates for development and commercialization, we
intend to continue to explore opportunities to develop our clinical pipeline by in-licensing drug compounds that fit within our expertise and research and development capabilities. We may
be unable to enter into any additional in-licensing agreements because suitable product candidates that are within our expertise may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to
us or because competitors with greater resources seek to in-license the same product candidates. Product candidates that we would like to develop may not be available to us because they
are controlled by competitors who are unwilling to license the rights to the drug compound or candidate to us. In addition, we may enter into license agreements that are unsuccessful and our business
and operations might be adversely affected by the termination of a drug candidate and termination and winding down of the related license agreement. For example, in April 2006, we announced the
discontinuation of development of DFC and
we gave notice of termination of our collaborative license agreement with Pharmasset, Inc., which licensed DFC to us. DFC was at the time our most advanced drug candidate. We may also need to
license drug delivery or other technology in order to continue to develop our drug candidate pipeline. If we are unable to enter into additional agreements to license drug candidates, drug delivery
technology or other technology or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts could be adversely affected.

If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to develop and market products in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we will not be permitted to manufacture or
commercialize products resulting from our research.

In order to manufacture and commercialize drug products in the United States, our drug candidates will have to obtain regulatory approval from the Food and Drug
Administration, or the FDA. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years. To obtain regulatory approval, we must first show that our drug products are safe and effective for
target indications through preclinical testing (animal testing) and clinical trials (human testing). Preclinical testing and clinical development are long, expensive and uncertain processes, and we do
not know whether the FDA will allow us to undertake clinical trials of any potential drug products in addition to our compounds currently in clinical trials.

Completion
of clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of testing. The length of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity,
novelty and intended use of the product candidate. Interim results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early clinical trials may
not be repeated in later clinical trials. For example, a drug candidate that is successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or


dangerous
side effects when tested at the clinical level. Our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:

•

the
high degree of risk associated with drug development;

•

our
inability to formulate or manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;

•

variability
in the number and types of patients available for each study;

•

difficulty
in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;

•

unforeseen
safety issues or side effects;

•

poor
or unanticipated effectiveness of drug candidates during the clinical trials; or

•

government
or regulatory delays.

Data
obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry,
including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, regulatory
authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of other factors, such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory agency review. For example, the FDA
has in the past required and could in the future require that we conduct additional trials of any of our product candidates, which would result in delays.

Due,
in part, to the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process, we cannot predict whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product we develop. Our
drug candidates in clinical trials are in early stage Phase I and Phase II trials. Our other drug candidates are still undergoing preclinical testing. We have also licensed to Pfizer our
portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. We have no control over the further clinical development of any compounds we licensed to Pfizer. Compounds developed by us, alone or with other parties, may not
prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval. If regulatory approval of a product is granted,
this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective. Failure to obtain regulatory approval would
delay or prevent us from commercializing products.

Outside
the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. This foreign regulatory
approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above and may also include additional risks.

Our reliance on other parties to manufacture our drug candidates could result in a short supply of the drugs, delays in clinical trials or drug development, increased costs and
withdrawal or denial of the regulatory authority's approval.

We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our drug candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties
for the manufacture of our drug candidates and any drug products that we may develop. The FDA requires that drug products be manufactured according to its current Good Manufacturing Practices, or
cGMP, regulations and a limited number of manufacturers comply with these requirements. If the other parties that we choose to manufacture our drug products are not compliant with cGMP, the FDA may
not approve our application to manufacture our drug products. We may not be able to arrange for our drug candidates or any drug products that we may develop to be manufactured by one of these parties
on reasonable


terms,
if at all. Failure to comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our products could result in the FDA withdrawing or denying regulatory approval of our drug product or other enforcement actions.

We
may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our drug candidates or any drug products we may develop if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or capability to
manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. Also, raw materials that may be required to manufacture any products we develop may only be available from a limited number of
suppliers. If we have promised delivery of a new product and are unable to meet the delivery requirement due to manufacturing difficulties, our development programs would be delayed, and we may have
to expend additional sums in order to ensure that manufacturing capacity is available when we need it even if we do not use all of the manufacturing capacity. This expense would adversely affect our
operating results.

Manufacturers
of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, especially in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production
costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We may not be able to
adequately manage and oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. Foreign manufacturing approval processes typically include all
of the risks associated with the FDA approval process for manufacturing and may also include additional risks.

We may incur additional expense in order to market our drug products.

We do not have experience marketing drug products. If the FDA grants regulatory approval to one or more of our drug candidates, we would have to employ additional
personnel or engage another party to market our drug products, which would be an additional expense to us.

We might not be able to commercialize our drug candidates successfully, and we may spend significant time and money attempting to do so.

We have a limited number of drug candidates in early stage Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. We have also licensed to Pfizer our portfolio of
CCR2 antagonist compounds. We, or our collaborators or licensees, may decide to discontinue development of any or all of our drug candidates at any time for commercial, scientific or other reasons. We
discontinued development of DFC in April 2006 for safety reasons. If a product is developed, but is not marketed, we may have spent significant amounts of time and money on it, which would adversely
affect our operating results and financial condition. Even if a drug candidate that we develop receives regulatory approval, we may decide not to commercialize it if we determine that
commercialization of that product would require more money and time than we are willing to invest. For example, drugs that receive approval are subject to post-regulatory surveillance and
may have to be withdrawn from the market if previously unknown side effects occur. At this point, the regulatory agencies may require additional clinical trials or testing. Once a drug is marketed, if
it causes side effects, the drug product may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling, warnings to the public and negative publicity. As a result, we may
not continue to commercialize a product even though it has obtained regulatory approval. Further, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if the market does not accept the product
because it is too expensive and third parties such as insurance companies or Medicare have not approved it for substantial reimbursement. In addition, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a
product if another product comes on the market that is as effective but has fewer side effects. There is also a risk that competitors may develop similar or superior products or have proprietary
rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our products.


Our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from payors of healthcare costs.

The continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce
costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative or license partners and the
availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States, given recent federal
and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of
prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or
adoption of these proposals could reduce the price that we or any of our collaborators or licensees receive for any products in the future.

Our
ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are
obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and
services. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health
care services and products, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products. The cost
containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.

As our drug discovery and development operations are conducted at our headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the loss of access to this facility would negatively impact our
business.

Our facility in Wilmington, Delaware is our headquarters and is also where we conduct all of our drug discovery operations and research and development
activities. Our lease contains provisions that provide for its early termination upon the occurrence of certain events of default or upon a change of control. Further, our headquarters facility is
located in a large research and development complex that may be temporarily or permanently shutdown if certain environmental or other hazardous conditions were to occur within the complex. In
addition, actions of activists opposed to aspects of pharmaceutical research may disrupt our experiments or our ability to access or use our facilities. The loss of access to or use of our Wilmington,
Delaware, facility, either on a temporary or permanent basis, or early termination of our lease would result in an interruption of our business and, consequently, would adversely affect the
advancement of our drug discovery and development programs and our overall business.

We depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel, and the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain
additional personnel would affect our ability to expand our drug discovery and development programs and achieve our objectives.

We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management, operations and scientific staff. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel.
Our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team, key scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit, train and retain essential
scientific personnel for our drug discovery and development programs, including those who will be responsible for overseeing our preclinical testing and clinical trials as well as for the
establishment of collaborations with other companies. If we lose the services of any of these people or if we are unable to recruit sufficient qualified personnel, our research and product development
goals, including the identification and establishment of key collaborations, operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed. We do not maintain "key person" insurance on any of our
employees.


If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our ability to develop and commercialize products could suffer.

We expect that if our clinical drug candidates continue to progress in development, we continue to build our development organization and our drug discovery
efforts continue to generate drug candidates, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management and resources. Our ability to commercialize our drug candidates and to achieve
our research and development objectives depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization, systems and controls to accommodate additional anticipated
growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business could be harmed and our ability to execute our business strategy could suffer.

We may encounter difficulties in integrating companies we acquire, which may harm our operations and financial results.

As part of our business strategy, we have in the past and may in the future acquire assets, technologies, compounds and businesses. Our past acquisitions, such as
the acquisition of Maxia have involved, and our future acquisitions may involve, risks such as the following:

•

we
may be exposed to unknown liabilities of acquired companies;

•

our
acquisition and integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate;

•

we
may experience difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disrupting our business and diverting our management's time
and attention;

•

we
may be unable to integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology, compounds or drug candidates;

•

we
may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;

•

our
relationships with key customers, suppliers, or collaborative or license partners of acquired businesses may be impaired, due to changes in management and ownership of
the acquired businesses;

•

we
may be unable to retain key employees of the acquired businesses;

•

we
may incur amortization or impairment expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets; or

•

our
stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities.

If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products and our results of
operations could be harmed.

The clinical trials and marketing of medical products that are intended for human use entails an inherent risk of product liability. If any product that we or any
of our collaborators or licensees develops causes or is alleged to cause injury or is found to be unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing or sale, we may be held liable. If we cannot
successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities, including substantial damages to be paid to the plaintiffs and legal costs, or we may be required
to limit commercialization of our products. Our product liability insurance policy that provides coverage for liabilities arising from our clinical trials may not fully cover our potential
liabilities. In addition, we may determine that we should increase our coverage upon the undertaking of new clinical trials, and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our
collaborators or licensees and may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to


obtain
sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we
develop, alone or with our collaborators. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation, recall of products, participants to withdraw from clinical trials, and
potential collaborators or licensees to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.

Because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials, we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials that could be
time consuming and costly.

We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, handling, storage and disposal of
regulated substances and the health and safety of our employees. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste resulting
in the production of hazardous waste products. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. If any injury or
contamination results from our use or the use by our collaborators or licensees of these materials, we may be sued and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Further, we
may be required to indemnify our collaborators or licensees against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these
collaborations or licenses. Compliance with the applicable environmental and workplace laws and regulations is expensive. Future changes to environmental, health, workplace and safety laws could cause
us to incur additional expense or may restrict our operations or impair our research, development and production efforts.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

We expect to incur losses in the future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

We had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through 2007. Because of those losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.0 billion as
of December 31, 2007. We will continue to spend significant amounts on our efforts to discover and develop drugs. As a result, we expect to continue to incur losses in 2008 and in future
periods as well.

We
anticipate that our drug discovery and development efforts will increase as we focus on the studies, including preclinical tests and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory
approval, that are required before we can sell a drug product. The development of drug products will require us to spend significant funds on research, development, testing, obtaining regulatory
approvals, manufacturing and marketing. To date, we do not have any drug products that have generated revenues and we cannot assure you that we will generate revenues from the drug candidates that we
license or develop for several years, if ever. We cannot be certain whether or when we will achieve profitability because of the significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate
commercially successful drug products. Even if we were successful in obtaining regulatory approvals for manufacturing and commercializing a drug candidate, we expect that we will continue to incur
losses if our drug products do not generate significant revenues. If we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.

We will need additional capital in the future. The capital markets may not permit us to raise additional capital at the time that we require it, which could result in
limitations on our research and development or commercialization efforts or the loss of certain of our rights in our technologies or drug candidates.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research
and development efforts going-forward. Additional factors that may affect our future funding requirements include:

•

any
changes in the breadth of our research and development programs;


•

the
results of research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trials conducted by us or our future collaborative partners or licensees, if any;

•

the
acquisition or licensing of businesses, technologies or compounds, if any;

•

our
ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations;

•

competing
technological and market developments;

•

the
amount of revenues generated from our business activities, if any;

•

the
time and costs involved in filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims;

•

the
receipt of contingent licensing or milestone fees or royalties on product sales from our current or future collaborative and license arrangements, if established; and

•

the
timing of regulatory approvals, if any.

If
we require additional capital at a time when investment in companies such as ours, or in the marketplace generally, is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions,
we may have to
scale back our operations, eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborative partner that would result in
terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates. If we are unable to raise funds at the time that we desire or at any time
thereafter on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to develop our potential drug products. The sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future would be dilutive to
our stockholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.

Our current revenues are derived from collaborations and from licensing our intellectual property. If we are unable to achieve milestones, develop products or renew or enter
into new collaborations, our revenues may decrease, and future milestone and royalty payments from our gene and genomics-related intellectual property may not contribute significantly to revenues for
several years, and may never result in revenues.

We derived substantially all of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 from our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer and
from licensing our intellectual property to others. We may be unable to enter into additional collaborative agreements. Revenues from research and development collaborations depend upon continuation
of the collaborations, the achievement of milestones and royalties we earn from any future products developed from our research. If we are unable to successfully achieve milestones or our
collaborators fail to develop successful products, we will not earn the revenues contemplated under our collaborative agreements. Part of our prior strategy was to license to our database customers
and to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies our know-how and patent rights associated with the information we have generated in the creation of our proprietary databases, for
use in the discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical, diagnostic or other products. Any potential product that is the subject of such a license will require several years of further
development, clinical trials and regulatory approval before commercialization, all of which is beyond our control, and possibly beyond the control of our licensee. These licensees may not develop the
potential product if they do not devote the necessary resources or decide that they do not want to expend the resources to do the clinical trials necessary to obtain the necessary regulatory
approvals. Therefore, milestone or royalty payments from these licenses may not contribute to our revenues for several years, if at all. We have decided to discontinue some of our gene and
genomics-related patent prosecution and maintenance, and may in the future decide to discontinue additional gene and


genomics-related
patent prosecution and maintenance, which could limit our ability to receive license-based revenues from our gene and genomics-related patent portfolio.

We have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.

As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of total consolidated debt was $421.8 million and our stockholders' deficit was
$159.5 million. The documents pursuant to which our outstanding convertible senior and subordinated notes were issued do not limit the issuance of additional indebtedness. Our substantial
leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations, including:

•

increasing
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limiting
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital and research and development expenditures, and general corporate purposes;

•

requiring
the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash
available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and research and development expenditures;

•

limiting
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; or

•

placing
us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.

In
the past five years, we have had negative cash flow from operations. We likely will not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to enable us to meet our
anticipated fixed charges, including our debt service requirements with respect to our outstanding convertible senior notes and convertible subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2007,
$151.8 million aggregate principal amount of our 3


/


% convertible senior notes due 2011 was outstanding. Our annual interest payments, beginning in 2007, for the


/


% convertible senior notes through 2010, assuming none of these notes are converted, redeemed, repurchased or exchanged, are $5.3 million, and an additional
$2.6 million in interest is payable in 2011. As of December 31, 2007, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2011
was outstanding. Our annual interest payments for the 3


/


%
convertible subordinated notes through 2010, assuming none of these notes are converted, redeemed, repurchased or exchanged, are $8.8 million, and an additional $4.4 million in interest
is payable in 2011. As of December 31, 2007, $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the non-interest bearing convertible subordinated notes held by Pfizer was
outstanding, of which $10.0 million is due in 2013 and $10.0 million is due in 2014. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or raise additional cash through financings
sufficient to meet these obligations, we will need to use existing cash or liquidate marketable securities in order to fund these obligations, which may delay or curtail our research, development and
commercialization programs.

RISKS RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LEGAL MATTERS

If we are subject to arbitration, litigation and infringement claims, they could be costly and disrupt our drug discovery and development efforts.

The technology that we use to make and develop our drug products, the technology that we incorporate in our products, and the products we are developing may be
subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others. The success of our drug discovery and development efforts will also depend on our ability to develop new compounds,
drugs and technologies without


infringing
or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. We are aware of patents and patent applications filed in certain countries claiming certain intellectual property relating to certain
of our drug discovery targets such as CCR5. While the validity of issued patents, patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain, if any of
these patents are asserted against us or if we choose to license any of these patents, our ability to commercialize our products could be harmed or the potential return to us from any product that may
be successfully commercialized could be diminished.

From
time to time we may receive notices from third parties offering licenses to technology or alleging patent, trademark, or copyright infringement, claims regarding trade secrets or
other contract claims. Receipt of these notices could result in significant costs as a result of the diversion of the attention of management from our drug discovery and development efforts. Parties
sending these notices may have brought and in the future may bring litigation against us or seek arbitration relating to contract claims.

We
may be involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights or contract violations. In addition, litigation or
other legal proceedings may be necessary to:

•

assert
claims of infringement;

•

enforce
our patents or trademarks;

•

protect
our trade secrets or know-how; or

•

determine
the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.

We
may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings. Regardless of the outcome, litigation or other legal proceedings can be very costly and
can divert management's efforts. For example, we recently settled patent litigation with Invitrogen Corporation. We incurred significant expenses related to this litigation and, as part of the
settlement, paid Invitrogen $3.4 million. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us or our collaborators or licensees to seek licenses to other parties'
patents or proprietary rights. We or our collaborators or licensees may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling a drug or other product that we or they develop. Further, we or
our future collaborators or licensees may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license
technology on a timely basis or on reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.

We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary information, which may result in its unauthorized use, a loss of revenue under a collaboration agreement or
loss of sales to generic versions of our products or otherwise reduce our ability to compete in developing and commercializing products.

Our business and competitive position depends in significant part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including any drug products that we
create. Despite our efforts to protect this information, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. For example, one of our collaborators may
disclose proprietary information pertaining to our drug discovery efforts. Our patent applications may fail to result in issued patents. In addition, because patent applications can take several years
to issue as patents, there may be pending patent applications of others that may later issue as patents that cover some aspect of our drug candidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we
may obtain may not be broad enough to protect our products or all of the potential uses of our products, or otherwise prevent others from developing competing products or technologies. In addition,
our patents may be challenged and invalidated or may


fail
to provide us with any competitive advantages if, for example, others were first to invent or first to file a patent application for the technologies and products covered by our patents.

Additionally,
when we do not control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain important intellectual property, such as a drug compound in-licensed to us or
subject to a collaboration with a third party, the protection of the intellectual property rights may not be in our hands. If we do not control the intellectual property rights in-licensed
to us with respect to a compound and the entity that controls the intellectual property rights does not adequately protect those rights, our rights may be impaired, which may impact our ability to
develop, market and commercialize the in-licensed compound.

Our
means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may:

•

independently
develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, products and techniques;

•

otherwise
gain access to our proprietary information; or

•

design
around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property.

We
pursue a policy of having our employees, consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us. However, these agreements
may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. If we fail to maintain trade secret and patent protection,
our potential, future revenues may be decreased.

If the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the United States patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications, the value of our
patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased.

The value of our patents depends in part on their duration. A shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights under any patents that we
obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents. The United States patent laws were amended in 1995 to change the term of patent protection from 17 years from patent issuance to
20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the application. Because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications may be more than three years depending on the subject
matter, a 20-year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection. Also, we may need to refile some of our applications filed before 1995 that claim
large numbers of genes or other additional subject matter and, in these situations, the patent term will be measured from the date of the earliest priority application. This would shorten our period
of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might derive from the patents.

International patent protection is particularly uncertain and costly, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries, we may have to expend substantial
sums and management resources.

Biotechnology and pharmaceutical patent law outside the United States is even more uncertain and costly than in the United States and is currently undergoing
review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. For example, certain
countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the treatment of humans. We may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors'
foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters is in Wilmington, Delaware, which is where our drug discovery and development operations are also located. These facilities are leased
to us until June 2010. We believe that these facilities are adequate to meet our business requirements for the near-term and that additional space will be available on commercially
reasonable terms, if required. In addition to this lease, we had lease agreements as of December 31, 2007 for facilities that were closed as a part of the restructurings of our genomic
information business in Palo Alto and San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2007, we had multiple sublease and lease agreements covering approximately 273,000 square feet that expire on
various dates ranging from June 2008 to March 2011. Of the approximately 273,000 square feet leased, approximately 174,000 square feet of this space is currently subleased to others.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial
Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Report.

Overview

Incyte is a drug discovery and development company focused on developing proprietary small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline
with programs in oncology, inflammation, diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Thus
far in our drug discovery and development activities, which began in early 2002, we have filed twelve Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) and have progressed eight
internally developed proprietary compounds into clinical development. Currently, four of these compounds have advanced into Phase II clinical trials. Our wholly-owned pipeline includes the
following compounds:

We
anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and development programs. We also expect that losses will fluctuate from
quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial. Conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates in development is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. We
do not expect to generate product sales from our drug discovery and development efforts for several years, if at all. If we are unable to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over
the next several years, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted.


Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer

Effective in January 2006, we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") for the pursuit of our CCR2 antagonist
program. We received an upfront nonrefundable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006. In addition, we received an aggregate of $20.0 million through the purchase of convertible
subordinated notes, $10.0 million in February 2006 and $10.0 million in October 2007 (the "Pfizer Notes"), and we are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone
payments of up to $740.0 million for the successful development and commercialization of CCR2 antagonists in multiple indications, as well as royalties on worldwide sales. We received a
$3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds, the most advanced of which
was in Phase IIa clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-resistant obese patients at the time the agreement became effective in January 2006. Pfizer's rights extend to the full
scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and lupus nephritis and other autoimmune nephritides, for which we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We
do not have obligations to Pfizer on preclinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications.

Restructuring Programs

In February 2004, we made the decision to discontinue further development of our information products line, close our Palo Alto headquarters and focus solely on
the discovery and development of novel drugs. We recorded $42.1 million in restructuring charges in 2004, including charges related to the closure of our facilities, prior tenant improvements
and equipment, a workforce reduction and other items. The restructuring charge originally included the present value of future lease obligations for two facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we
made a lease termination payment to satisfy our remaining lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities. The lease obligation for the second facility extends through March 2011. As a result
of the long term nature of the remaining lease obligation, we will be recording a charge each period through the March 2011 termination date of the lease related to increases in the fair value of the
lease obligations in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities

, which total approximately $0.9 million at December 31, 2007. The cash impact in 2007 from restructuring related charges was
$5.6 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

•

Revenue
recognition;

•

Research
and development costs;

•

Valuation
of long-lived assets;

•

Restructuring
charges; and

•

Stock
compensation.

Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.


We
have entered into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual property. Revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or
until no further obligations exist. We exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess
whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based
primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.

Revenues
from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period. Revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of
the related agreements. Royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We estimate royalty revenues based on
previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee. We exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for
us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon.

Under
agreements involving multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met,
including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When separate units of
accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from
historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. If such evidence of fair value for each undelivered
element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the
arrangement are delivered. When elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. When
revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.

In
connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006. The
$40.0 million upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, our estimated performance period under the agreement. In
February 2006 and October 2007, Pfizer purchased the Pfizer Notes. As the Pfizer Notes are non-interest bearing, they have been discounted to their net present value. The difference
between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes, plus the related beneficial conversion feature, totals $3.2 million for each note, which represents additional consideration
from Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and will recognize it over our estimated performance period under the agreement. We recognize
contract revenues in connection with research services provided to Pfizer as earned. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007 that is included in contract revenues. All
milestone payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

Research and Development Costs.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 2 ("SFAS 2"),

Accounting for Research and Development Costs

, it is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred.
We often contract with clinical research organizations ("CROs") to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that research and development costs
are expensed as incurred, we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.

These
CRO contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event
that we prepay


CRO
fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are
performed in accordance with EITF 07-3,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
Activities.

Most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract
period. These professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date.

Our
CRO contracts generally include pass through fees. Pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous
costs including shipping and printing fees. Because these fees are incurred at various times during the contract term and they are used throughout the contract term, we record a monthly expense
allocation to recognize the fees
during the contract period. Fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

We assess the impairment of long-lived
assets, which includes property and equipment as well as intangible and other assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we
consider important that could indicate the need for an impairment review include the following:

•

Significant
changes in the strategy of our overall business;

•

Significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

•

Significant
changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets;

•

Significant
negative industry or economic trends;

•

Significant
decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and

•

Our
market capitalization relative to net book value.

When
we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets

("SFAS 144"), we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists. If impairment exists, we measure the impairment based on the difference between the asset's
carrying amount and its fair value.

Restructuring Charges.

Costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after
December 31, 2002, are accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

("SFAS 146"). Costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to December 31, 2002 have been recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

("EITF 94-3") and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,

Restructuring and Impairment
Charges

("SAB 100"). Restructuring costs resulting from the acquisition of Maxia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Maxia") have been recorded in accordance with EITF Issue
No. 95-3

, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination

("EITF 95-3"). The
restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs to exit facilities, reduce our workforce, write-off fixed assets, and pay for outside services incurred in the restructuring. The
workforce reduction charge is determined based on the estimated severance and fringe benefit charge for identified employees. In calculating the cost to exit the facilities, we estimate for each
location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments, the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated, the amount, if any, of sublease receipts and real estate
broker fees. This requires us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated, the amount of operating costs, and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site. To
form our estimates for


these
costs, we perform an assessment of the affected facilities and consider the current market conditions for each site. We also estimate our credit adjusted risk free interest rate in order to
discount our projected lease payments in accordance with SFAS 146. Estimates are also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that is being held for sale. These
estimates are formed based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions. Our assumptions on either the lease termination payments, operating costs until terminated, the
offsetting sublease receipts and estimated realizable value of fixed assets held for sale may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates. Our estimates
of future liabilities may change, requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities recorded.

At
the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy, that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are
for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans. We periodically evaluate current available information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary. We also make adjustments
related to accrued professional fees to adjust estimated amounts to actual. For the year ended December 31, 2007, such adjustments were made for the 2002 restructuring program, 2004
restructuring program, and the acquisition of Maxia.

Stock Compensation.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS 123R"),

Share-Based Payment

, which revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123
("SFAS 123"),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payment transactions with employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values. SFAS 123R requires significant judgment and the
use of estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based
compensation. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation
expense related to employee stock options was not recognized in the statement of
operations. Prior to January 1, 2006, we had adopted the disclosure-only provisions under SFAS 123. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $10.1 million
and $8.9 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

We recorded net losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $86.9 million and $74.2 million, respectively. On a
basic and diluted per share basis, net loss from operations was $1.03 and $0.89 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Our
contract revenues were $29.8 million and $24.2 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contract revenues were derived from recognition of revenue
associated with the Pfizer $40.0 million


upfront
fee, recognition of revenue associated with the debt discount and beneficial conversion feature related to the Pfizer Notes, and research services provided to Pfizer. In addition, we received
a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer during 2007.

Our
license and royalty revenues were $4.6 million and $3.4 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. License and royalty revenues were derived from database subscriptions
and licensing of our gene- and genomic-related intellectual property. We expect that revenues generated from information products, including licensing of gene- and
genomic-related intellectual property, will decline as we focus on our drug discovery and development programs.

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, revenues from companies considered to be related parties, as defined by FASB Statement No. 57,

Related Party
Disclosures

("SFAS 57") was $0.3 million. There was no such revenue recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our related parties consist of companies
in which members of our Board of Directors have invested, either directly or indirectly, or in which a member of our Board of Directors is an officer or holds a seat on the Board of Directors (other
than an Incyte-held Board seat).

We
currently track research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project. Salary and benefits related expense increased from 2006 to 2007 due to
increased development headcount and incentive compensation expense. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of options granted, stock price volatility and
expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. The increase in collaboration and outside services from 2006 to 2007 is due
primarily from the growth and steady advancement of our clinical pipeline. The increase in occupancy and other costs from 2006 to 2007 was primarily the result of costs associated with intellectual
property protection.

Research
and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of preclinical and clinical trial-related activities.
Many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials, including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, the need to enroll additional patient
cohorts, adverse side effects among patients, the availability of supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical
trials. In addition, the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. These factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of
the further development and approval of our products.

Other expenses.

Other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $(0.4) million and
$2.9 million, respectively. The decrease from 2006 to 2007 is due primarily to the settlement agreement
with Invitrogen related to our discontinued genomic information business which resulted in a $3.4 million charge recorded in other expenses in 2006. This settlement resolved all outstanding
claims included in the litigation.

In
2007, we recorded $0.7 million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $0.9 million of benefit in connection with our 2002 restructuring program
and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia. In 2006, we recorded $1.0 million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $1.5 million of
benefit in connection with our 2002 restructuring program and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia.

Other income (expense)

Interest and other income (expense), net.

Interest and other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006 was $22.4 million and $20.7 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 from 2006 was primarily attributable to the $8.5 million realized gain recorded from the sale
of our investment in a privately-held company in December 2007 offset by a lower average cash balance during 2007. In 2006, we recorded a $6.2 million realized gain from the sale of
our investment in a publicly-held company offset by an impairment charge of $1.3 million recorded to reduce the carrying value of our investment in a privately-held
investee.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $24.0 million and
$17.9 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 from 2006 is primarily attributable to the increase in accretion of the discount related to the 3


/


% convertible senior notes
due 2011 (the "3


/


% Senior Notes") issued in September 2006 of $8.2 million in 2007 compared to $2.1 million in the corresponding period of 2006.

Gain (loss) on redemption/repurchase of convertible subordinated notes.

In 2006 we redeemed $91.6 million principal
amount of our 5.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2007 (the "5.5% Notes"). The redemption resulted in a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes.

Due to our net losses in 2007 and 2006, we did not have an annual income tax provision.


Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005

We recorded net losses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 of $74.2 million and $103.4 million,
respectively. On a basic and diluted per share basis, net loss from continuing operations was $0.89 and $1.24 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

information products. The increase in revenues from 2005 to 2006 was due to our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer.

For

$1.4 million, respectively, and represent charges recorded in connection with restructuring and long-lived asset impairments. The increase from 2005 to 2006 is due primarily to the
settlement agreement with Invitrogen related to our discontinued genomic information business which resulted in a $3.4 million charge recorded in other expenses. This settlement resolved all
outstanding claims included in the litigation.

In
2006, we recorded $1.0 million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $1.5 million of benefit in connection with our 2002 restructuring program
and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia.

In
2005, in conjunction with our 2004 restructuring program, we recorded $1.0 million in expense, including charges related to the closure of our Palo Alto facility, previously
capitalized tenant improvements and equipment, a workforce reduction and other items. During 2005, we also recorded charges of $0.4 million of expense in connection with our 2002 restructuring
program and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia.

Other income (expense)

Interest and other income (expense), net.

Interest and other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005 was $20.7 million and $12.5 million, respectively. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily attributable to the $6.2 million realized gain recorded from the sale
of our investment in a publicly-held company in March 2006 and due to higher interest rates in 2006 offset by an impairment charge of $1.3 million recorded in June 2006 to reduce
the carrying value of our investment in a privately-held investee. In 2005 we realized a $2.8 million gain from the sale of securities of a strategic investee.

Interest expense.

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17.9 million and
$16.1 million, respectively. The increase in 2006 from 2005 is primarily attributable to the accretion of $2.1 million of the discount related to the 3

Losses on certain derivative financial instruments.

Losses on certain derivative financial instruments for the year ended
December 31, 2005 of $0.1 million represents the change in fair value of certain long-term investments, specifically warrants held in other companies, in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

("SFAS 133"). Gain or loss on derivative
financial instruments may fluctuate in any given period based upon current market conditions and is recognized during the period of change.

Gain (loss) on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes.

In 2006 we redeemed $91.6 million principal amount and in
2005 we repurchased, on the open market, $36.5 million face value of our 5.5% Notes. The redemption and repurchase resulted in a gain (loss) of $(0.1) million and $0.5 million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes.

Due to our net losses in 2006 and 2005, we had a minimal effective annual income tax
rate. The benefit for income taxes for 2005 is primarily attributable to foreign withholding taxes.

Gain (loss) from discontinued operation.

The gain from discontinued operation of $0.3 million in 2005 represent the
results of our Proteome facility based in Beverly, Massachusetts. In December 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to our Proteome facility, which
subsequently closed in January 2005. The consolidated financial statements have been restated to present the operations of our Proteome facility as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Sources and Uses of Cash.

Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have not been profitable and have
generated operating losses since we were incorporated in 1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through 2007. As such, we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities,
the issuance of convertible subordinated notes, cash received from customers, and collaborative arrangements. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $0.9 million of marketable securities
were classified as long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as they had been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and we had the ability to hold
them until the carrying value recovers, which may be longer than one year. At December 31, 2007, we had available cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term
marketable


securities
of $257.3 million. Our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments including obligations of U.S. government agencies,
high-grade corporate bonds, asset backed and mortgage backed securities and money market accounts. Available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy's primary objectives
of liquidity, safety of principal and diversity of investments.

Cash used in Operating Activities.

The $42.3 million increase in cash used in operating activities from 2006 to 2007
was due primarily to the $40.0 million nonrefundable upfront fee received from Pfizer in January 2006. The $51.5 million decrease in cash used in operating activities from 2005 to 2006
was also due primarily to the $40.0 million upfront fee received from Pfizer in January 2006.

Cash provided by Investing Activities.

Our investing activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable
securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long-term investments. In the future, net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate
significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments, acquisitions, including possible earn-out payments to former Maxia stockholders, capital expenditures
and maturities/sales and purchases of marketable securities.

Cash provided by (used in) Financing Activities.

In connection with the collaborative research and license agreement, Pfizer
purchased a $10.0 million Pfizer Note in October 2007. In addition, we received $2.3 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase
plan. During 2006, we issued a total of $151.8 million of 3


/


% Senior Notes, which resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $111.9 million. In addition, we redeemed
$91.6 million of the 5.5% Notes during 2006. In connection with the collaborative research and license agreement, Pfizer purchased a $10.0 million Pfizer Note in February 2006. During
2005, we paid $35.8 million in connection with repurchases of $36.5 million in face value of the 5.5% Notes, offset partially by $1.5 million of proceeds from issuance of common
stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan.

The
amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations. We have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space
with scheduled payments to us of $3.1 million (less than 1 year), $4.2 million (years 1 - 3), and $0.3 million
(years 4 - 5); these scheduled payments are not reflected in the above table.

The
table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events. The most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations
are summarized below.


Commitments
related to our acquisition of Maxia are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable. We completed our
acquisition of Maxia in February 2003. Under the merger agreement, former Maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of
$14.0 million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement. Twenty percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will be paid in cash and
the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million in our common stock (based upon the then fair
value) could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn
out milestones. The milestones are set to occur as Maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the
merger. In any event, no more than 13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to former Maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement. None of these milestones has been
achieved as of December 31, 2007.

We
have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to compounds or technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under
these licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products.

We
believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our cash requirements depend on
numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with alliances, license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary products, technologies and businesses; expenditures
in connection with potential repayments of our 3


/


% Senior Notes, 3


/


% Subordinated Notes, the Pfizer Notes; expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and
development programs; expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; competing technological and market developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing
patent claims and other intellectual property rights; our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into, including the agreement with Pfizer; and
costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through any mergers and acquisitions. Changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses
may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources. We expect that future revenues generated from information products, including licensing of intellectual
property, will continue to decline as we focus on drug discovery and development programs, and in 2008, will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed under Contractual Obligations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our investments in marketable securities, which are composed primarily of investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. government agency debt securities, mortgage and
asset-backed securities and money market funds, are subject to default, changes in credit rating and changes in market value. These investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
in value if market rate interest rates increase. As of December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were
$257.3 million. Due to the nature of these investments, if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of December 31, 2007 the decline in fair
value would not be material.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements


Interim Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited)



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Incyte Corporation as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at item 15 (a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Incyte Corporation, at December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Incyte Corporation changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) on January 1, 2006.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Incyte Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Business.

Incyte Corporation ("Incyte," "we," "us," or "our") is a drug discovery and development company
focused on developing proprietary small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline with programs in oncology, inflammation, diabetes, and human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV).

We
were founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1991. Until 2001, we devoted substantially all of our resources to the development, marketing and sales of information and genomic
products. We began our drug discovery and development activities in early 2002.

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Incyte Corporation and our wholly
owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications.

Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 financial
statement presentation.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States are measured using the local
currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, as appropriate. The resulting translation
adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders'equity (deficit). Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of
exchange.

Concentrations of Credit Risk.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade receivables, and long-term
strategic investments are financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. The estimated fair value of financial instruments approximates the carrying value based
on available market information. We primarily invest our excess available funds in notes and bills issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and corporate debt securities and, by policy, limit
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and to any one type of investment, other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Our customers for our information products are
primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are typically located in the United States and Europe. We have not experienced any significant credit losses on cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities or trade receivables to date and do not require collateral on receivables.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. banks or in custodial accounts with U.S., and U.K.
banks. Cash equivalents are defined as all liquid investments and money market funds with maturity from date of purchase of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash and have
insignificant interest rate risk.

Marketable Securities—Available-for-Sale.

All marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity (deficit). We classify marketable securities available to fund current operations as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Marketable securities are classified as long-term assets on the consolidated


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

balance
sheets if (i) they have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and (ii) we have the ability to hold them until the carrying value is recovered and such
holding period may be longer than one year. The amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity. Such amortization
is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary for available-for-sale securities are included in "Interest
and other income (expense), net." The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Accounts Receivable.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an
allowance for doubtful accounts based on experience and specifically identified risks. Accounts receivable are carried at fair value and charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we
determine that recovery is unlikely and we cease collection efforts.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (generally three to five years). Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or lease term.

Certain
laboratory and computer equipment used by us could be subject to technological obsolescence in the event that significant advancement is made in competing or developing equipment
technologies. Management continually reviews the estimated useful lives of technologically sensitive equipment and believes that those estimates appropriately reflect the current useful life of our
assets. In the event that a currently unknown significantly advanced technology became commercially available, we would re-evaluate the value and estimated useful lives of our existing
equipment, possibly having a material impact on the financial statements.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

Long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangible assets,
to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable such as a significant industry
downturn or a significant decline in our market value. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition. Measurement of impairment charges for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of such
assets. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. There have been no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 or 2005.

Long-Term Investments.

We have made equity and debt investments in a number of companies whose businesses may be
complementary to our business. Most of these investments were made in connection with the establishment of a collaborative arrangement between us and the investee company. Our long-term
investments have historically consisted of investments in both privately and publicly-held companies in which we have owned less than 20% of the outstanding voting stock and have not had
the ability to exert significant influence over the investees. Accordingly, our long-term investments in privately-held companies have been accounted for under the cost method
and our investments in publicly-held companies have been accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

. Our investments in publicly-held companies are classified as
available-for-sale and are adjusted to their fair value each period based on their quoted market price with any adjustments


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

being
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity (deficit).

We
periodically evaluate the carrying value of our ownership interests in privately-held cost method investees by reviewing conditions that might indicate an
other-than temporary decline in fair value, including the following:

•

Financial
performance of the investee;

•

Achievement
of business plan objectives and milestones including the hiring of key employees, obtaining key business partnerships, and progress related to research and
development activities;

•

Available
cash; and

•

Completion
of debt and equity financings.

If
our review of these factors indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the investee has occurred, we estimate the fair value of the
investee. When the carrying value of our investments is materially greater than our pro-rata share of the estimated fair value of the investee, we record an impairment charge to reduce our
carrying value. Impairment charges are recorded in the period when the related triggering condition becomes known to management. We use the best information available in performing our periodic
evaluations; however, the information available may be limited. These evaluations involve significant management judgment, and the actual amounts realized for a specific investment may differ from the
carrying value. For our available-for-sale investments in publicly-held investees, we monitor all unrealized losses to determine whether a decline in fair value
below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Generally, when fair value is materially less than carrying value for six consecutive months, we consider the decline to be
other-than-temporary. When we conclude that a decline is other-than-temporary, we adjust the carrying value of our long-term investments in
publicly-held investees so that our carrying value per share is equal to the quoted market price per share. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
underlying investments could result in additional impairment charges.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

We hold warrants to purchase equity securities of a publicly-held company.
Warrants that can be exercised and settled by delivery of net shares such that we pay no cash upon exercise or that are held in public companies are deemed derivative financial instruments. Gains and
losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations in "Gain (loss) on certain derivative financial instruments" in the period of change. We
determine the fair value of our warrants through option pricing models using current market price and volatility assumptions.

Intangible and Other Assets.

Patent application costs relating to ongoing drug discovery and development are charged to
expense as incurred. In prior years, costs of patents, patent applications and patent defense for gene and genomic patents were capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives of approximately five years in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17,

Intangible
Assets

("APB 17").

Income Taxes.

Income taxes are accounted for using SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes.

Deferred income taxes are provided at the currently enacted income tax rates for the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and
liabilities and carry-forward items. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

ultimate
outcome of various tax audits and issues. In addition, valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets where the amount of expected future taxable income from operations does not
support the realization of the asset. We believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the current year effective and deferred tax positions are appropriate. However,
if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated
financial statements.

Financing Costs Related to Long-term Debt.

Costs associated with obtaining long-term debt are
deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share.

We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per
Share,

which requires us to present basic and diluted earnings per share. Our basic and diluted losses per share are calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during all periods presented. Options to purchase stock and convertible debt are included in diluted earnings per share calculations, unless the effects
are anti-dilutive.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the following:

Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We have entered into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and
use of our intellectual property. Revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist. We exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably
assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and
whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the customer's payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.

Revenues
from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period. Revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of
the related agreements. Royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We estimate royalty revenues based on
previous


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

period
royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee. We exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to
base our royalty revenue recognition thereon.

Under
agreements involving multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met,
including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When separate units of
accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values. The
determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers. If such evidence of fair value for each
undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all
elements of the arrangement are delivered. When elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is
completed. When revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.

In
connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer"), we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $40.0 million
in January 2006. The $40.0 million upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, our estimated performance period
under the agreement. Pfizer purchased a $10.0 million principal amount convertible subordinated note in February 2006 and an additional $10.0 million principal amount convertible
subordinated note (the "Pfizer Notes") in October 2007. As the Pfizer Notes are non-interest bearing, they have been discounted to their net present value. The difference between the cash
received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes, plus the related beneficial conversion feature, totals $3.2 million for each note, which represents additional consideration from Pfizer
under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and will recognize it over our estimated performance period under the agreement. We recognize contract
revenues in connection with research services provided to Pfizer as earned. We received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007 that is included in contract revenues. All milestone
payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

Research and Development.

Research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in
performing research and development activities: salaries and related benefits, collaboration and outside services, and occupancy and all other costs. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 2 ("FAS 2"),

Accounting for Research and Development Costs

, it is our policy to expense research and development
costs as incurred. We often contract with Clinical Research Organizations ("CROs") to facilitate, coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that research and
development costs are expensed as incurred, we record monthly accruals for clinical trial and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract.

These
CRO contracts typically call for payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event that
we prepay CRO fees for future milestones, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and
development services are performed in accordance with EITF 07-3,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities.

Most professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and medical
writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. These professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date.

Our
CRO contracts generally include pass through fees. Pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous
costs including shipping and printing fees. Because these fees are incurred at various times during the contract term and they are used throughout the contract term, we record a monthly expense
allocation to recognize the fees during the contract period. Fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period.

Other Expenses.

We recognize other expenses in connection with our plans to exit certain activities. In connection with our
exit activities, we record other expenses for employee termination benefit costs, long-lived asset impairments, costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased, and other
exit-related costs. These charges were incurred pursuant to formal plans developed by management and accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

, ("SFAS 146"), EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

("EITF 94-3") and EITF Issue No. 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Business Combination

("EITF 95-3"). Fixed assets that are written off or impaired as a result of restructuring plans are typically held for sale or scrapped.
The remaining carrying value of such assets was not material as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The recognition of other expenses requires our management to make judgments and estimates
regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity, including estimating sublease income and the fair value, less sales costs, of equipment to be disposed of.
Management's estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting
period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that they are adequate, that no excess accruals are retained, and that the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in
accordance with developed exit plans.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS 123R"),

Share-Based Payment

, which revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123
("SFAS 123"),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payment transactions with employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values. The application of SFAS 123R requires
significant judgment and the use of
estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options was not recognized in the statement of operations. Prior to January 1, 2006, we had
adopted the disclosure-only provisions under SFAS 123. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $10.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of stock
compensation expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2005 we recorded stock compensation
expense of $0.2 million in the consolidated statements of operations related to restricted shares issued to our Chief Executive Officer.

Net
realized gains (loss) of ($0.4) million, $6.1 million and $1.3 million from sales of marketable securities were included in "Interest and other income/ (expense), net"
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Note 3. Concentrations of Credit Risk

As of December 31, 2007, we previously had entered into agreements for information products and services, which include licensing a portion of our
intellectual property, with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and agricultural companies and academic institutions. Such agreements represented 100% of license and royalty revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005.
In general, customers agree to pay,
during the term of the agreement, fees to receive non-exclusive access to selected modules of our databases and/or licenses of certain of our intellectual property. In addition, if a
customer develops certain products utilizing our technology or proprietary information, we could potentially receive royalty and milestone payments. In November 2005, we entered into a collaborative
research and license agreement with Pfizer, which became effective in January 2006.

A
single customer contributed 87%, 88% and 21% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Three
customers comprised 68% and 78% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Note 4. Collaborative License Agreement

Effective in January 2006, we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the pursuit of our CCR2 antagonist program. Pfizer gained
worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple
sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides,


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 4. Collaborative License Agreement (Continued)

where
we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on pre-clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications.

We
received an upfront nonrefundable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006 and are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments of up to
$740.0 million for the successful development and commercialization of CCR2 antagonists in multiple indications, as well as royalties on worldwide sales. We received a $3.0 million
milestone payment from Pfizer in 2007. The $40.0 million upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, our estimated
performance period under the agreement. Contract revenues related thereto of approximately $20.7 million and $20.3 million, respectively, were recognized for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006. All milestone payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone.

We
also recognized contract revenues of approximately $1.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 in connection with
research services provided to Pfizer. We recognize contract revenues in connection with research services provided to Pfizer as earned. At December 31, 2007 approximately $0.4 million
was receivable from Pfizer for reimbursement of expenses incurred by us pursuant to the agreement.

In December 2007, we recorded a gain of approximately $8.5 million in interest and other income, net as a result of the sale of Velocity11, a
privately-held life sciences technology company in which we held an ownership position. We may receive additional consideration of approximately $0.9 million after a one year escrow
period.

In
June 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million in interest and other income, net to reduce the carrying value of our investment in a privately-held
investee because the investee had less

than
six months of cash and we believed that the likelihood of obtaining future debt or equity financing that would not result in an impairment was remote.

In
March 2006, we sold a portion of our investment in a publicly-held company accounted for under FASB Statement No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, for $11.5 million, and in October 2006, we sold the remaining portion of this investment for $5.8 million, which
resulted in a aggregate realized gain of $6.2 million in interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2006.

In
May 2005, we sold our investment in a publicly-held company accounted for under FASB Statement No. 115,

In
March 2002, in connection with his employment by Incyte as Executive Vice President and Chief Drug Discovery Scientist, Brian W. Metcalf received an interest-free loan
from us in the amount of $400,000 to be used for financing his residence in California. The loan was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by the residence. On February 6, 2003, 25% of the
outstanding principal balance was forgiven, and


/


of the principal amount was forgiven on the last day of each month thereafter, with the remaining outstanding principal balance of
the loan forgiven on February 6, 2006. We amortized this loan to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the forgiveness period.

In
2004, we sublet one of our existing facilities to a third party. Under the terms of the consent agreement with the facility's landlord, we were required to obtain a letter of credit
in favor of the landlord in the amount of $2.6 million. The deposit and the related amount required under the letter of credit declines monthly on a pro-rata basis through March
2011, the remaining term of the lease agreement assigned. The deposit is included in other assets at December 31, 2007.

were
issued at a discount to par of approximately $39.9 million. The carrying value of the 3

In
connection with the collaborative research and license agreement, Pfizer purchased a $10.0 million principal amount Pfizer Note in February 2006 and an additional
$10.0 million principal amount Pfizer Note in October 2007. The Pfizer Notes bear no interest, are due seven years from the date of issuance and are convertible into our common stock at initial
conversion prices of $6.8423 and $9.75 per share, respectively, subject to adjustments. The Pfizer Notes are subordinated to all senior indebtedness, including the 3


/


% Senior Notes,
and pari passu in right of payment with our 3


/


% Subordinated Notes. We may, at our option, repay the Pfizer Notes beginning February 3, 2009 and October 10, 2010,
respectively. Pfizer may require us to repay the Pfizer Notes upon a change of control, as defined. As the Pfizer Notes are non interest bearing, they have been discounted to their net present value
of $6.8 million each by imputing interest at a rate of 4.5% and 3.9%, respectively, which represented market conditions in place at the time the notes were issued. The carrying value of the
Pfizer Notes were $7.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. We will accrete the Pfizer Notes up to their face value over their term of seven years by
recording interest expense under the effective interest method. The difference between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Notes plus the related beneficial conversion feature totals
$3.2 million for each note, which represents additional consideration from Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and will recognize
it over our estimated performance period under the agreement. Contract revenues related thereto of approximately $4.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, were recognized for the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

In
February and March 2004, in a private placement, we issued a total of $250.0 million of the 3


/


% Subordinated Notes, which resulted in net proceeds of
approximately $242.5 million. The notes bear interest at the rate of 3.5% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. The notes are subordinated to
all senior indebtedness, including the 3


/


% Senior Notes, and pari passu in right of payment with the Pfizer Notes. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an
initial conversion price of approximately $11.22 per share, subject to adjustments. Holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change in control, as defined. We may redeem the notes
beginning February 20, 2007.

Note 9. Other Expenses

The estimates below have been made based upon management's best estimate of the amounts and timing of certain events included in the restructuring plan that will
occur in the future. It is possible that the actual outcome of certain events may differ from the estimates. Changes will be made to the restructuring accrual at the point that the differences become
determinable. The accrual balances for the restructuring plans are included in accrued restructuring and other liabilities (long-term) in the consolidated balance sheets.

In February 2004, we announced a restructuring plan to close our information products research facility and headquarters in Palo Alto, California
and move our headquarters to our Wilmington, Delaware pharmaceutical research and development facility. The closure of the Palo Alto facility corresponded with terminating further development
activities around our Palo Alto-based information products line. The restructuring plan included the elimination of 183 employees and charges related to the closure of our Palo Alto
facilities, previously capitalized tenant improvements and equipment and other items. The lease commitment and related costs originally included the present value of future lease obligations for two
facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we made a lease termination payment to satisfy our remaining lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities. The lease obligation for the second
facility extends through March 2011. As a result of the long term nature of the remaining lease obligation, we will be recording a charge each period through the March 2011 termination date of the
lease related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 146,

In November 2002, we announced plans to reduce our expenditures, primarily in research and development, through a combination of spending
reductions, workforce reductions, and office consolidations. The plan included elimination of approximately 37% of our approximately 700-person workforce from our offices in Palo Alto,
California; Beverly, Massachusetts; and Cambridge, England and the consolidation of our office and research facilities in Palo Alto, California. As a result, we recorded an expense of
$33.9 million related to restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2002.

We currently have one remaining lease related to an exited site that is due to expire in December 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, we recognized additional charges of $(0.3) million, $(1.5) million and $0.1 million, respectively, primarily relating to this facility for lease expenses in excess or less
than of amounts originally estimated. We estimated the costs based on the contractual terms of agreements and current real estate market conditions. We may incur additional costs associated with these

In accordance with EITF 95-3, we recorded a $2.9 million charge in 2003 related to restructuring costs for Maxia
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Maxia"), which consisted of workforce reductions and consolidation of facilities. We recorded employee termination costs of approximately $0.8 million for 28
employee positions. The job eliminations were completed in July 2003. We also recorded restructuring costs related to lease payments for property that has been vacated and other costs of
$2.0 million. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recorded additional charges of $(0.6) million, $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, relating to facilities lease expenses
in excess of amounts originally estimated. The operating lease related to the vacated facility expires in November 2008.

Note 10. Stockholders' Deficit

Preferred Stock.

We are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which was outstanding as of
December 31, 2007 or 2006. The Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences and privileges of any preferred stock issued in the future. We have reserved 250,000 shares of preferred
stock designated as Series A Participating Preferred Stock for issuance in connection with the Stockholders Rights plan described below.

Common Stock.

As of December 31, 2007, we had reserved a total of 17,300,458 shares of our common stock for future
issuance related to our stock plans as described below.

On
November 5, 2004, we completed a public offering of 9 million shares of our authorized but unissued common stock at $9.75 per share pursuant to an effective shelf
registration statement, resulting in net proceeds of $83.3 million after deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

Stock Compensation Plans.

Summaries of stock option activity for our stock option plans as of December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, and related information for the years ended December 31 are included in the plan descriptions below.

Note 10. Stockholders' Deficit (Continued)

1991 Stock Plan.

In November 1991, the Board of Directors adopted the 1991 Stock Plan (the "Stock Plan"), which was amended
and restated for issuance of common stock to employees, consultants, and scientific advisors. Options issued under the plan shall, at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors, be either incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options or restricted stock units. The exercise prices of incentive and non-statutory stock options granted under the plan
are not less than the fair market value on the date of the grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted after February 2007 generally vest over three years, pursuant to a formula
determined by our Board of Directors, and expire after seven years. Options granted prior to February 2007 generally vest over four years, pursuant to a formula determined by our Board of Directors,
and expire after ten years. Certain options granted in 2002 vest pro rata monthly over three years and expire after ten years. In May 2007, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan from 22,350,000 to 25,350,000.

During
2001, we granted 490,000 restricted stock units under the Stock Plan to certain management personnel. Stock compensation expense of $0.2 million was recorded in 2005. As of
December 31, 2005, all of the restricted stock units had vested or had been previously forfeited.

Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan.

In August 1993, the Board of Directors approved the 1993 Directors'
Stock Option Plan (the "Directors' Plan"), which was later amended. The Directors' Plan provides for the automatic grant of options to purchase shares of common stock to our non-employee
directors. In June 2005, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan from 1,100,000 to 1,500,000.

Under
the Directors' Plan, each new non-employee director joining the Board will receive an option to purchase 35,000 shares of common stock. Additionally, members who
continue to serve on the Board will receive annual option grants for 20,000 shares exercisable in full on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. All options are exercisable at the fair market
value of the stock on the date of grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

On May 21, 1997, our stockholders adopted the ESPP. In May 2006, our stockholders
approved an increase in the number of shares available for grant from 3,100,000 shares to 3,850,000 shares. Each regular full-time and part-time employee working
20 hours or more per week is eligible to participate after one month of employment. We issued 337,689, 313,715 and 389,801 shares under the ESPP in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For the
year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 we recorded stock compensation expense of $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, under SFAS 123R as the ESPP is considered
compensatory under SFAS 123R. As of December 31, 2007, 638,484 shares remain available for issuance under the ESPP.

Stockholders Rights Plan.

On September 25, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the "Rights
Plan"), pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right (a "Right") was distributed for each outstanding share of common stock held of record on October 13, 1998. One Right will also
attach to each share of common stock issued by the Company subsequent to such date and prior to the distribution date defined below. Each Right represents a right to purchase, under certain
circumstances, a fractional share of our Series A Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $100.00, subject to adjustment. In general, the Rights will become exercisable and trade
independently from the common stock on a distribution date that will occur on the earlier of (i) the public announcement of the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more of the common
stock or (ii) ten days after commencement of a tender or exchange offer for the common stock that would result in the acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock. Upon the occurrence of
certain other events related to changes in ownership of the common stock, each holder of a Right would be entitled to purchase shares of common stock, or an acquiring corporation's common stock,
having a market value of twice the exercise price. Under certain conditions, the Rights may be redeemed at $0.01 per Right by the Board of Directors. The Rights expire on September 25, 2008.

Note 11. Stock compensation

We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of
operations. We recognize the stock compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. Prior to January 1, 2006, we
followed APB Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock compensation.

We
elected the modified prospective method in adopting SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of
adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption using the same valuation method
(Black-Scholes) and assumptions determined under the original provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as disclosed in
our previous filings.

Under
the provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $10.1 and $8.9 million, respectively, of stock compensation expense on our audited condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. We utilized the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value of the stock compensation granted, with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Federal Reserve rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected life calculation is based on the observed and expected
time to the exercise of options by our employees based on historical exercise patterns for similar type options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the
period commensurate with the expected life of the options. A dividend yield of zero is assumed based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash
dividends.

Based
on our historical experience, we have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of 5% for our options. Under the true-up provisions of SFAS 123R, we will record
additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than we estimated, and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than we estimated.

SFAS 123R
requires us to present pro forma information for the comparative period prior to the adoption as if we had accounted for all our stock options under the fair value
method of the original SFAS 123. The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if we had applied the

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by approximately $36.0 million, $38.2 million and $48.8 million during the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately $61.7 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to benefits from stock option deductions which, when recognized, will
be allocated directly to contributed capital.

Management
believes the uncertainty regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets requires a full valuation allowance.

As
of December 31, 2007, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $804.0 million. We also had federal and state research and development
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $37.0 million. The net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will expire at various dates, beginning in 2008 through 2027, if not utilized.
Utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to an annual limitation, due to the "change in ownership" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state
provisions. We also had federal and state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $19.4 million that will expire beginning in 2009.

Note 13. Net Loss Per Share

For all periods presented, both basic and diluted net loss per common share are computed by dividing the net loss by the number of weighted average common shares
outstanding during the period.

Note 14. Segment Reporting

Our operations are treated as one operating segment, biotechnology drug discovery and development, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 131
("SFAS 131"). For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded revenue from customers throughout the United States and in Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Export
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

Note 15. Defined Contribution Plan

We have a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering all domestic employees. Employees may contribute a
portion of their compensation, which is then matched by us, subject to certain limitations. Defined contribution expense was $0.5 million, $0.0 million and $0.5 million in 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Note 16. Litigation

Invitrogen

In October 2001, Invitrogen Corporation ("Invitrogen") filed an action against us in the federal court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of
three patents. On June 15, 2006 we entered into a settlement agreement with Invitrogen pursuant to which we agreed to pay Invitrogen $3.4 million

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 16. Litigation (Continued)

as
a settlement fee. This amount is included in other expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.

In
addition to the matter described above, from time to time we have been involved in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management's opinion, the
outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Note 17. Related Party Transactions

The following summarizes our related party transactions as defined by FASB Statement No. 57,

Related Party
Disclosures

("SFAS 57"). In each of the transactions noted in which a director of Incyte was at the time of the transaction in some way affiliated with the other party
to the transaction, such director recused himself from voting on the related party transaction, other than the Senomyx, Inc. transaction.

During
1997, we purchased diaDexus Series B Preferred Stock at a cost of $1.3 million. We do not have the ability to exert significant influence over diaDexus. We have an
executive officer who sits on diaDexus' Board of Directors. In June 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million to reduce the carrying value of this investment because the investee
had less than six months of cash and the likelihood of future debt or equity financing that would not result in an impairment was remote.

During
2000 and 2001 we purchased shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock of Genomic Health, Inc. ("Genomic Health") for an aggregate
purchase price of $6.0 million. In connection with the completion of its initial public offering on October 4, 2005, these shares were converted into common shares. Additionally as part
of its initial public offering, Genomic Health exercised an election under which we were required to acquire an additional $5.0 million of Genomic Health common stock. In March 2006, we sold
our initial investment for $11.5 million, and in October 2006, we sold the remaining portion of this investment for $5.8 million, which resulted in a aggregate realized gain of
$6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Julian C. Baker, one of our directors, is also a director of Genomic Health and holds shares, directly or beneficially, of both
companies.

During
2000, we purchased shares of Series D Preferred Stock of Senomyx, Inc. ("Senomyx") for an aggregate purchase price of $6.5 million. In connection with the
completion of Senomyx's initial public offering in 2004, our ownership interest was converted into common shares. These shares were sold in 2005 for $5.7 million, resulting in a realized gain
of $2.8 million from their carrying value. Frederick B. Craves, one of our former directors, is a partner of Bay City Capital, which held shares of Senomyx stock.

During
2005, we repurchased on the open market, and retired, $36.5 million in face value of 5.5% Notes. One such transaction in 2005 involved the repurchase, at a purchase price
of 98.25% of face value, of $5.0 million in face value of such notes from a limited partnership of which Julian C. Baker, one of our directors, is a controlling member of the general partner of
the general partner and may have a pecuniary interest. Mr. Baker did not participate in our decision to engage in such a repurchase transaction. The price paid by us in such repurchase
transaction was equal to the price paid by us to an independent third party in a comparable transaction negotiated on an arms'-length basis a short time prior to such repurchase transaction.

Note 18. Commitments

As of December 31, 2007, we had noncancelable operating leases on multiple facilities and equipment, including facilities in Palo Alto, California; San
Diego, California; and Wilmington, Delaware. The leases expire on various dates ranging from June 2008 to March 2011. Certain leases have renewal options for periods ranging up to 5 years. Rent
expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, was approximately $4.6 million, $4.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2007, future noncancelable minimum payments under operating leases, including leases for sites included in the restructuring programs were as follows:

The
amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations. We have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space
with scheduled payments to us of $3.1 million (less than 1 year), $4.2 million (years 1-3), and $0.3 million (years 4-5).

In
addition to the non-cancelable commitments included in the table above, we have entered into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make payments to the contractual
counterparties upon the occurrence of future events. We consider these potential obligations contingent, and have summarized all significant arrangements below.

Commitments
related to Maxia are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable. In February 2003, we completed our
acquisition of Maxia. Under the merger agreement, former Maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of $14.0 million upon the
occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement. Twenty percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent
will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million in our common stock (based upon the then fair value) could potentially be paid
pursuant to the earn out milestones. The milestones occur as Maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the
consummation of the merger. In any event, no more than
13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to former Maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement. None of these milestones had been achieved as of December 31,
2007.

We
have entered into and intend to continue to seek to license additional rights relating to compounds or technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs.

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards.
Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte Corporation

We
have audited Incyte Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Incyte Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Incyte Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Incyte Corporation as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2007 of Incyte Corporation and our report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
