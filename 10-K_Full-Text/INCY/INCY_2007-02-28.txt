Overview

Incyte is a

drug
discovery and development company focused on developing proprietary small
molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline with
programs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diabetes, oncology and
inflammation.

Thus far in our drug discovery and development
activities, which began in early 2002, we have taken five internally developed
compounds into clinical development, and have progressed four of these
compounds into Phase II clinical trials. Of the four compounds progressed into
Phase II clinical trials, the first was from our CCR2 program for inflammatory
diseases, which is now the basis of a broad collaboration with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”)
established in January 2006, the second is our sheddase inhibitor from our
most advanced oncology program, the third is our lead CCR5 antagonist for HIV
and the fourth is our lead 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1,
more commonly called 11

β

HSD1, inhibitor for type 2 diabetes.

Incyte’s

In April 2006, we announced that we were
discontinuing the development of dexelvucitabine or DFC (formerly known as
Reverset), a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor that we
in-licensed from Pharmasset, Inc. At the time, this compound was in Phase
IIb development as a treatment for HIV.


During 2006, we
filed four Investigational New Drug applications (INDs):

·

one
for our lead CCR5 compound that is now in Phase IIa clinical trials;

·

a
second for our lead 11

β

HSD1 inhibitor for type 2 diabetes that
is also in Phase IIa clinical trials;

·

a
third for a follow-on CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I development; and

·

a
fourth for a CCR2 antagonist for multiple sclerosis.

We expect to file additional INDs in the first half of
2007 for a new program targeting Janus-associated kinases (JAK). We believe our
orally available JAK inhibitors have potential in chronic inflammatory
conditions, myeloproliferative disorders and certain cancers.

Our productivity in drug
discovery is primarily a result of our core competency in medicinal chemistry,
integrated with and supported by an experienced team of biologists with
expertise in multiple therapeutic areas. As a number of our compounds have
progressed into clinical development, we have also built a clinical development
and regulatory team. This team utilizes clinical research organizations (CROs),
expert scientific advisory boards and leading consultants in relevant
therapeutic areas with a view toward ensuring that we conduct our clinical
trials as efficiently and effectively as possible while maintaining strategic
control of the design and management of our programs.

Incyte’s Approach
to Drug Discovery and Development

To succeed in our objective to create a pipeline of
novel, orally available drugs that address serious unmet medical needs, we have
established a broad range of discovery capabilities in-house, including target
validation, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational
chemistry, and pharmacological and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and
excretion) assessment. We augment these capabilities through collaborations
with academic and contract laboratory resources with relevant expertise.

We select drug targets with strong preclinical or
clinical validation in areas where we have the potential to generate either
first-in-class molecules or compounds that are highly differentiated from
existing treatments.

Our chemistry and biology efforts are highly
integrated and are characterized by the rapid generation of relevant data on a
broad and diverse range of compounds for each therapeutic target we pursue. This
process allows our scientists to better understand, in real time, the potency
and selectivity of the compounds, how they are likely to be absorbed and
eliminated in the body, and to assess the potential safety of the compounds. We
believe that this approach, along with stringent criteria for the selection of
clinical candidates, will help us to select appropriate candidates for clinical
development.

Given our chemistry-driven discovery process, our
pipeline has grown to encompass multiple therapeutic areas: HIV, diabetes,
oncology and inflammation. While our productivity has created a diverse
pipeline, we conduct a limited number of discovery programs in parallel at any
one time. This focus allows us to allocate resources to our selected programs
at a level that we believe is competitive with much larger pharmaceutical
companies. We believe this level of resource allocation, applied to the
discovery process outlined above, has been critical to our success in our
current programs, and that it remains a meaningful competitive advantage.

In all of our programs we strive to generate a diverse
and broad range of proprietary compounds which we believe enhances the overall
probability of success for our programs and creates the potential for multiple
products.

Once our compounds reach
clinical development, our objective, whenever possible, is to rapidly progress
the lead candidate into a proof-of-concept clinical trial prior to initiating
larger definitive


Phase IIb
clinical trials to quickly assess the therapeutic potential of the clinical
candidate itself and its underlying mechanism

.

Incyte’s Clinical
Development and Regulatory Team

Our clinical development
and regulatory team is responsible for ensuring that our clinical candidates
are expeditiously progressed from preclinical development and IND-enabling
studies into Phase I and Phase II development. Our internal multi-disciplinary
project teams work with experienced external CROs with expertise in managing
clinical trials, process chemistry, product formulation and manufacturing to
support our development efforts. Thus far while at Incyte, this team has filed
six INDs and advanced five compounds into clinical development.

Commercial Strategy

We intend to develop and
commercialize some of our compounds on our own in selected markets where a
company of our size can compete effectively, such as HIV, oncology, and certain
inflammatory conditions. For programs that target large primary care
indications such as diabetes and/or require lengthy and expensive clinical
development plans, we may seek to form strategic alliances as we did with
Pfizer for our CCR2 antagonist program.

Collaborative
Research and License Agreement with Pfizer

Effective in January 2006,
we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the
pursuit of our CCR2 antagonist program. We received an upfront nonrefundable
payment of $40.0 million in January 2006, $10.0 million was received
through the purchase of a convertible subordinated note (the “Pfizer Note”) in February 2006
and we are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone
payments of up to $743.0 million for the successful development and
commercialization of CCR2 antagonists in multiple indications, as well as
royalties on worldwide sales. Pfizer gained worldwide development and
commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds, the
most advanced of which was in Phase IIa clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis
and insulin-resistant obese patients at the time the agreement became effective
in January 2006. Pfizer’s rights extend to the full scope of potential
indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and lupus nephritis and
other autoimmune nephritides, for which we retained worldwide rights, along
with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on preclinical
development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications.  At our option, prior to September 28,
2007, once we are able to initiate

Phase
I clinical trials of a CCR2 antagonist in a retained Incyte indication, Pfizer
may purchase from us an additional $10.0 million convertible subordinated note.

Clinical Pipeline

Our pipeline includes
compounds in various stages of development in the areas of HIV, diabetes,
oncology and inflammation. The following summarizes the status of and rationale
for our most advanced compounds.

CCR5 Antagonist
Program for HIV

CCR5 is a major chemokine receptor that the HIV virus
uses to enter CD4 cells, which are critical to the human immune system. CCR5
antagonists belong to a new, investigational class of antiretrovirals known as
HIV entry inhibitors. This new class includes various experimental compounds
designed to block cell surface receptors, such as CCR5 or CXCR4, as well as
other novel compounds that block HIV fusion with the cell surface. Entry
inhibitors work by blocking HIV before the virus enters the cell and begins its
replication process. In contrast, existing HIV drugs such as nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase


inhibitors (NRTIs),
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease
inhibitors work inside the cell and target the proteins, reverse transcriptases
and proteases that are involved in the replication of the virus.

Our CCR5 antagonist program has yielded potent,
selective, proprietary compounds with pharmacokinetic properties that have the
potential to allow once-daily dosing without use of ritonavir boosting, a key
distinction from other CCR5 antagonists in development. Ritonavir is a protease
inhibitor that is often used in combination with other drugs to improve or ‘boost’
the bioavailability and cellular penetration of other drugs but which is
associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This dosing profile is
particularly attractive in patients who are in the earlier stages of disease,
where CCR5 is most prevalent, where the majority of regimens are once-daily
(which improves patient compliance), and where ritonavir, which increases the
risk of cardiovascular disease, is less frequently used. Once-a-day dosing also
offers the potential for the development of once-daily fixed dose combination
formulations with other anti-HIV medications.

We have two CCR5 antagonists in development, INCB9471
and INCB15050. INCB9471 is the most advanced compound in this program and is
currently being studied in a 14-day double-blind placebo-controlled Phase
IIa proof-of-concept trial in HIV patients. We have seen preliminary positive
results that suggest that INCB9471 may offer sustained inhibition of viral
replication in patients who are intermittently non-compliant as compared to
other CCR5 antagonists and other antiretroviral drugs that have shorter
half-lives. Lack of adherence with drugs that have short half lives, less than
24 hours, can lead to insufficient drug levels, which reduces the effectiveness
of the drug regimen and allows the virus to replicate.

Our follow-on CCR5
antagonist, INCB15050, is currently in Phase I development. While the initial
results from the Phase I clinical trials suggest that INCB15050 also has the
potential to be a potent once-a-day treatment, based on the positive
preliminary Phase IIa clinical trial data that we have seen with the lead
compound, INCB9471, we do not plan to advance INCB15050 beyond Phase I clinical
trials at this time.


β

HSD1
Program for Type 2 Diabetes and Related Disorders

We have developed a broad chemically diverse series of
novel proprietary oral inhibitors of 11ßHSD1, an enzyme that converts the
biologically-inactive steroid cortisone into the potent biologically-active
hormone cortisol. Cortisol acts as a functional antagonist of insulin action in
multiple tissue types, including the liver, adipose, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas. Inhibition of 11

β

HSD1 offers the potential to
reduce insulin resistance and restore glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, and
may also offer potential benefits in allied conditions such as dyslipidemia,
atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease.

We have completed single-
and multiple-dose Phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers with our lead
11ßHSD1 inhibitor compound, INCB13739. We have also obtained preliminary data
from our first Phase IIa trial, in which a single dose of INCB13739 completely
inhibited 11

β

HSD1
activity over a 24-hour period in both adipose tissue and liver of
obese insulin-resistant subjects. The ability to fully inhibit 11

β

HSD1 in these tissues, which are
major contributors to the body’s control of glucose metabolism, suggests
that INCB13739 has the necessary properties to demonstrate the potential
therapeutic effect of 11

β

HSD1
inhibition and support its continued development. A 28-day Phase
IIa clinical trial of INCB13739 in type 2 diabetic patients is expected to
begin in the first quarter of 2007.

CCR2 Receptor
Antagonist Program for Inflammatory Diseases

Chemokines are proteins secreted at sites of injury or
inflammation that attract and activate leukocytes, or white blood cells, such
as monocytes. CCR2 is a key chemokine receptor found on monocytes that controls
their migration into sites of inflammation. Once inside the monocytes
differentiate


into tissue scavenger
cells known as macrophages. In their normal role, macrophages scavenge foreign
organisms or injured tissues; however, excessive or inappropriately triggered
macrophage activity results in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators
that can cause damage to tissues and can lead to a chronic inflammatory
response. There is substantial preclinical data from multiple academic centers
suggesting that CCR2 antagonism could be of therapeutic benefit in multiple
sclerosis (MS). Activated macrophages accumulate in MS lesions, where they are
associated with and presumed to be required for the destruction of the myelin
sheath, the protective coating around the nerves which disrupts nerve signaling
and leads to loss of  muscle control, vision, balance and sensation. Blocking
macrophage accumulation at these sites could thus lead to significant
amelioration of this chronic and debilitating disease.

We established a collaborative research and license
agreement with Pfizer in January 2006 in which Pfizer gained worldwide
development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist
compounds. We retained rights to certain CCR2 antagonists for MS and lupus nephritis
and other autoimmune nephritides.

We are pursuing MS first
given the preclinical evidence suggesting that selective CCR2 antagonism has
therapeutic potential in this disease. We have selected a lead clinical candidate,
INCB8696, and filed the IND for this compound in December of 2006. We plan
to initiate a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers in the first half of
2007.

JAK 2 Program for
Inflammatory Diseases, Myeloproliferative Disorders and Cancer

Our second inflammation program is directed toward
inhibitors of a different target, JAK2. There are four JAK enzymes—JAK1, JAK2,
JAK3 and TYK2. JAKs are required for the signaling triggered by a number of
growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and excessive signaling through
JAK-driven pathways is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of
multiple inflammatory diseases, myeloproliferative disorders, and certain
cancers.

Recently presented clinical data from another company
has demonstrated the efficacy of an oral JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis
and psoriasis. While this compound was described as a moderately selective JAK3
inhibitor, we believe the efficacious doses of this JAK3 inhibitor also
inhibited JAK2.

We have focused our
efforts on JAK2 inhibitors because of the following observations:

·

Monoclonal
antibodies that block the function of cytokines which signal through JAK2, but
not JAK3, appear to be as efficacious as the aforementioned oral JAK3 inhibitor
in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

·

To
date, JAK3 inhibition has been demonstrated to suppress T-lymphocyte function.
Beyond the risks inherent in immunosuppression, immunosuppressive drugs that
impair T-lymphocyte function have only been modestly effective in rheumatoid
arthritis.

·

A
mutation in JAK2, V617F, is highly prevalent in myeloproliferative disorders, a
cluster of diseases characterized by abnormal production of formed elements in
the blood, which are associated with a significant risk of thrombosis and progress
to life threatening conditions such as myelofibrosis and leukemia. The presence
of this mutation in virtually all patients with polycythemia vera (>90%) as
well as a significant proportion of patients with essential thrombocythemia
(50%), and myeloid metaplasia (50%) suggests that blocking JAK2-driven
proliferation may provide therapeutic benefit in myeloproliferative disorders.


For these reasons, we believe that JAK inhibitors that
are more effective against JAK2 than JAK3 may achieve equivalent or possibly
superior clinical efficacy to JAK3-focused agents in inflammatory
diseases, with less potential for immunosuppression, and that JAK2 inhibitors
may also be of value in the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders and
certain cancers.

Our JAK2 program includes
multiple potent and orally bioavailable JAK2 inhibitors from multiple
distinct chemical scaffolds which may have therapeutic potential as treatments
for chronic inflammatory conditions, myeloproliferative disorders, and certain
cancers. A number of these compounds are expected to enter clinical trials
beginning in the first half of 2007.

Sheddase Inhibitor
Program

for Solid
Tumors

As the fundamental biology of cancer has been explored
at the molecular level, new therapeutics are emerging that distinguish
themselves from the classic, relatively non-selective, cytotoxic agents. These
new therapeutics are targeted specifically to pathways or proteins that are
more critical for the growth of tumor cells than for the growth of normal
cells, thereby having the potential to provide a greater therapeutic benefit,
both when used alone and in combination with cytotoxic agents. Currently
available therapeutics of this type have been shown to be effective in the
treatment of certain important tumor types.

The signaling pathways that utilize the receptors and
ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family play a key role
in the growth and survival of multiple tumor types, including breast,
colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers. The EGFR, or HER, signaling
pathways consist of four known cellular receptors: HER1 (also known as EGFR),
HER2, HER3, and HER4. Under normal conditions, these pathways are tightly
regulated. However, in cancer, the pathways can become dysregulated and changes
in the amount or the activity of HER family members, primarily HER1, HER2 and
HER3, have been shown to impact the growth, proliferation, migration, and
survival of cancer cells. Sheddase is an enzyme that is believed to activate
all four EGFR pathways.

Currently approved therapies target one or more of the
EGFR pathways. However these currently available therapeutics may not block all
EGFR family-mediated signaling, even in the tumor types in which they are
approved. In contrast, we believe our sheddase inhibitor targets all four EGFR
signaling pathways and may provide meaningful advantages over therapies that
target one or two.

We have identified novel,
potent, and orally available small-molecule inhibitors of sheddase that, in
preclinical models, show efficacy as single agents and show synergy with other
targeted therapeutic agents and with cytotoxics. We have completed single and
multiple dose Phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers with the lead
compound from this program, INCB7839, and we have initiated a Phase Ib/IIa
dose-ranging trial in refractory cancer patients with solid tumors such as
breast, non-small cell lung, prostate, colorectal and head and neck cancer. In
this trial, we are seeking to establish the maximum tolerated dose of the
compound and select a dose for advancing INCB7839 into Phase II trials in
breast cancer and possibly one other solid tumor type.

Preclinical Programs

We have a number of early
discovery programs at various stages of preclinical testing. We do not
typically disclose these programs and/or targets until we have successfully
completed preclinical toxicology tests with the lead clinical candidate.

Patents and Other
Intellectual Property

We regard the protection of patents and other
enforceable intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to
our business and competitive position. Accordingly, we rely on patent, trade
secret and copyright law, as well as nondisclosure and other contractual
arrangements, to protect our intellectual


property. We have
established a patent portfolio of owned or in-licensed patents and patent
applications that cover aspects of all our drug candidates, as well as other
patents and patent applications that relate to full-length genes and
genomics-related technologies obtained as a result of our past high-throughput
gene sequencing efforts. The patents and patent applications relating to our
drug candidates generally include claims directed to the drug candidates,
methods of using the drug candidates, formulations of the drug candidates, and
methods of manufacturing the drug candidates. Our policy is to pursue patent
applications on inventions and discoveries we believe that are commercially
important to the development and growth of our business.

Patents extend for varying periods according to the
date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded
by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the
country.

We have a number of established patent license
agreements relating to our gene patent portfolio and our genomics-related
technology patent portfolio. We are presently receiving royalties and other
payments under certain of our gene and genomics-related patent license
agreements. Under our gene patent license agreements, we may in the future
receive royalties and other payments if our partners are successful in their
efforts to discover drugs and diagnostics under these license agreements.

We may seek to license rights relating to compounds or
technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs.
Under these licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, license fees,
milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products.

Although we believe our rights under patents and
patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve
complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable
products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents in the United
States or elsewhere from pending applications. Even if patent claims are
allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be
valid or enforceable or may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned
by or licensed to us or provide us with a competitive advantage. Any patent or
other intellectual property rights that we own or obtain may be circumvented,
challenged or invalidated by our competitors. Others may have patents that
relate to our business or technology and that may prevent us from marketing our
product candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. In
addition, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against
claims of infringement, to enforce patents, to protect our other intellectual
property rights, to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights
of third parties or to defend ourselves in patent or other intellectual
property right suits brought by third parties. We could incur substantial costs
in such litigation or other proceedings. An adverse outcome in any such
litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liability.

With respect to
proprietary information that is not patentable, and for inventions for which
patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and
confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. While we require all
employees, consultants and potential business partners to enter into
confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade
secrets or other proprietary information. Others may independently develop
substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise
gain access to our trade secrets.

Competition

Our drug discovery and development activities face,
and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research
institutions and government agencies. Our major competitors include fully integrated
pharmaceutical companies that have extensive drug discovery efforts and are
developing novel small molecule


pharmaceuticals. We face
significant competition from organizations that are pursuing pharmaceuticals
that are competitive with our potential products.

Many companies and
institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have
substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development
staffs than we do. In addition, many competitors, either alone or together with
their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do
in:

·

drug
discovery;

·

developing
products;

·

undertaking
preclinical testing and clinical trials;

·

obtaining
FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and

·

manufacturing,
marketing, distributing and selling products.

Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining
patent protection, receiving FDA approval or commercializing products before we
do. If we commence commercial product sales, we will be competing against
companies with greater manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling
capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience.

In addition, any
drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies
that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise
from:

·

other
drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the
incidence of disease;

·

new
small molecules; or

·

other
classes of therapeutic agents.

Developments by others may render our drug candidates
obsolete or noncompetitive. We face and will continue to face intense
competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with
academic and research institutions and for licenses to proprietary technology. These
competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in
developing products that are more effective than ours.

Our ability to
compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

·

develop
proprietary products;

·

develop
and maintain products that reach the market first, are technologically superior
to and/or are of lower cost than other products in the market;

·

attract
and retain scientific and product development personnel;

·

obtain
patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;

·

obtain
required regulatory approvals; and

·

manufacture,
market, distribute and sell any products that we develop.

In a number of countries,
including in particular, developing countries, government officials and other
groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs available
at a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that
where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be
enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical companies
have greatly reduced prices for HIV drugs in certain developing countries. If
certain countries do not


permit
enforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in those countries,
and in other countries by importation from low-price countries, could be
reduced by generic competition or by parallel importation of our product. Alternatively,
governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses
to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products
in those countries, thereby reducing our product sales, or we could respond to
governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products. In all of these
situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Government
Regulation

Our related ongoing
research and development activities and any manufacturing and marketing of our
potential small molecule products to treat major medical conditions are subject
to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United
States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any drug
developed by us must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials
and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the
United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates, among other
things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy,
record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and
distribution of these products. None of our drug candidates has, to date, been
submitted for approval for sale in the United States or any foreign market. The
regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and
clinical trials of each drug candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Securing
FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data
and supporting information to the FDA for each indication to establish a drug
candidate’s safety and efficacy. The approval process takes many years,
requires the expenditure of substantial resources, involves post-marketing
surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. Before
commencing clinical investigations in humans, we must submit to, and receive
approval from, the FDA of an IND application. The steps required before a drug
may be marketed in the United States include:

·

preclinical
laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;

·

submission
to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective
before human clinical trials may commence;

·

adequate
and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to
establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;

·

submission
to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, which must become effective
before marketing can commence;

·

satisfactory
completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at
which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing
practices; and

·

FDA
review and approval of the NDA.

Similar requirements exist within many foreign
agencies as well. The time required to satisfy FDA requirements or similar
requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based on the
type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.

Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of
product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The
results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and
analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND will
automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before
that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the
conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND. In the latter case, the
IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions
before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND
will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.


Clinical trials involve the administration of the
investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified
investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the
objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the
effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the
FDA as part of the IND and each trial must be reviewed and approved by an
independent ethics committee or institutional review board (IRB) before it can
begin.

Clinical trials
typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap
or be combined. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the
investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage
tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, and, if
possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase II usually
involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to:

·

evaluate
dosage tolerance and optimal dosage;

·

identify
possible adverse effects and safety risks; and

·

evaluate
and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific
indications.

Phase III clinical trials usually further evaluate
clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an
expanded patient population, providing statistical evidence of efficacy and
safety and providing an adequate basis for physician labeling. We cannot
guarantee that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed
successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we or
the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a
finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable
health risk.

Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained,
further studies, including post-approval trials, may be required to provide
additional data on safety and will be required to gain approval for the sale of
a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which
the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA will require
post-approval reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of
post-approval programs may limit or expand the indications for which the drug
product may be marketed. Further, if there are any requests for modifications
to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in indication,
manufacturing process, labeling or manufacturing facilities, a supplemental NDA
may be required to be submitted to the FDA.

Clinical trials must meet requirements for IRB
oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices. Clinical trials must
be conducted under FDA oversight. Before receiving FDA clearance to market a
product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the
patient population that will be treated. If regulatory clearance of a product
is granted, this clearance will be limited to those disease states and
conditions for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through
clinical trials. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is
prohibited. Furthermore, clearance may entail ongoing requirements for
post-marketing studies. Even if this regulatory clearance is obtained, a
marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject
to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. Discovery of
previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result
in restrictions on this product, manufacturer or facility, including costly
recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market.

The length of time
and related costs necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly
and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to
varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional
factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or cause
the costs of these clinical trials to increase, include:

·

slow
patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients
to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study, competition with
clinical trials for other drug candidates or other factors;


·

inadequately
trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and
monitoring clinical trials;

·

delays
in approvals from a study site’s IRB;

·

longer
than anticipated treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or
determine the appropriate product dose;

·

lack
of sufficient supplies of the drug candidate for use in clinical trials;

·

adverse
medical events or side effects in treated patients; and

·

lack
of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested.

Any drug is likely to produce some toxicities or
undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at
sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of time. Unacceptable
toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level, and at any time in the
course of animal studies designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug
candidate, known as toxicological studies, or in clinical trials of our
potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect
could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort
the development of any of our drug candidates, and could ultimately prevent
their marketing clearance by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any
or all targeted indications.

The FDA’s fast track program is intended to facilitate
the development and expedite the review of drug candidates intended for the
treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases and that demonstrate the
potential to address unmet medical needs for these conditions. Under this
program, the FDA can, for example, review portions of an NDA for a fast track
product before the entire application is complete, thus potentially beginning
the review process at an earlier time.

We cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant any of our
requests for fast track designation, that any fast track designation would
affect the time of review or that the FDA will approve the NDA submitted for
any of our drug candidates, whether or not fast track designation is granted. Additionally,
FDA approval of a fast track product can include restrictions on the product’s
use or distribution (such as permitting use only for specified medical
procedures or limiting distribution to physicians or facilities with special
training or experience). Approval of fast track products can be conditioned on
additional clinical trials after approval.

FDA procedures also provide for priority review of
NDAs submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, offer a
significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease.
The FDA seeks to review NDAs that are granted priority status more quickly than
NDAs given standard status. The FDA’s stated policy is to act on 90% of
priority NDAs within six months of receipt. Although the FDA historically has
not met these goals, the agency has made significant improvements in the
timeliness of the review process.

We and any of our contract manufacturers are also
required to comply with applicable FDA current good manufacturing practice
regulations. Good manufacturing practices include requirements relating to
quality control and quality assurance as well as to corresponding maintenance
of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection
by the applicable regulatory authorities. These facilities, whether our own or
our contract manufacturers, must be approved before we can use them in
commercial manufacturing of our related products. We or our contract
manufacturers may not be able to comply with applicable good manufacturing
practices and FDA or other regulatory requirements. If we or our contract
manufacturers fail to comply, we or our contract manufacturers may be subject
to legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of
product, or voluntary recall of product. Furthermore, continued compliance with
applicable good manufacturing practices will require continual


expenditure of time, money
and effort on the part of us or our contract manufacturers in the areas of
production and quality control and record keeping and reporting, in order to
ensure full compliance.

Outside the United States,
our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing
authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements
governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and
reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign
marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within
the European Union, or EU, regional registration procedures are available to
companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. If the
regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and
efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This
foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with
FDA approval discussed above and may also include additional risks.

Incyte’s Transition
into Small-Molecule Drug Discovery and Development

Before the completion of our transition into a drug
discovery and development company, we marketed and sold access to our genomic
information databases. However, in recent years, consolidation within the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and a challenging economic environment
led to reduced demand for research tools and services. This trend, together
with the public availability of genomic information, significantly reduced the
market for and revenues from, our information products.

On February 2, 2004,
we announced substantial changes in our information products operations,
including the closure of our Palo Alto, California facility and the cessation
of development of the information products developed at this facility. In January 2005,
we sold certain assets and liabilities related to our Proteome facility based
in Beverly, Massachusetts. We no longer have any activities in the information
products area. However, we retain certain existing licenses and licensing
activities related to the intellectual property portfolio generated prior to
the transition.

Research and
Development

Since our inception, we
have made substantial investments in research and technology development.
During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred research and development expenses of
$87.6 million, $95.6 million and $88.3 million, respectively.

Human Resources

As of December 31,
2006, we had 186 employees, including 152 in research and development and 34 in
finance, operations support and administrative positions. Of these employees,
116 employees have advanced technical degrees including 7 MD’s and 65 Ph.D’s. None
of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and
management considers relations with our employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

RISKS RELATING TO
OUR BUSINESS

We are at the early stage of our drug discovery and
development efforts and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts.

We are in the early
stage of building our drug discovery and development operations. Our ability to
discover, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products will depend on our
ability to:

·

hire and retain key
scientific employees;

·

identify high quality
therapeutic targets;

·

identify potential drug
candidates;

·

develop products internally
or license drug candidates from others;

·

identify and enroll
suitable human subjects, either in the United States or abroad, for our
clinical trials;

·

complete laboratory testing
and clinical trials on humans;

·

obtain and maintain
necessary intellectual property rights to our products;

·

obtain and maintain
necessary regulatory approvals for our products, both in the United States and
abroad;

·

enter into arrangements
with third parties to provide services or to manufacture our products on our
behalf, or develop efficient production facilities meeting all regulatory
requirements;

·

deploy sales and marketing
resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide
these functions;

·

lease facilities at
reasonable rates to support our growth; and

·

enter into arrangements
with third parties to license and commercialize our products.

Of the compounds that we
identify as potential drug products or that we in-license from other companies,
only a few, if any, are likely to lead to successful drug development programs.
Significant research and development efforts will be necessary. For example, in
April 2006, we announced the discontinuation of development of DFC, which
was at the time our most advanced drug candidate and was in Phase IIb clinical
trials. Prior to discontinuation of the DFC program, we expended a significant
amount of effort and money on that program. We have limited experience with the
activities listed above and may not be successful in discovering, developing,
or commercializing drug products. If we choose to outsource some of these
activities, we may be unable to enter into outsourcing or licensing agreements
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if we elect to
manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities, we will require
substantial additional capital resources to lease or build and maintain those
facilities, including attracting and retaining qualified personnel to lease or
build and operate our facilities.

Our efforts to discover and develop potential drug
candidates may not lead to the discovery, development, commercialization or
marketing of drug products.

We are currently engaged
in a number of different approaches to discover and develop novel drug
candidates. Our drug candidates in clinical trials are in early Phase I and
Phase IIa trials for indications in HIV, diabetes and oncology. Our other
earlier stage internal drug discovery programs are focused on compounds with
potential applications in myeloproliferative disorders, oncology and
inflammation. We


have
also licensed to Pfizer our lead CCR2 antagonist, which was in Phase IIa
clinical trials at the time of licensing to Pfizer. We have no control over the
further clinical development of any compounds we licensed to Pfizer. Discovery
and development of potential drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming,
and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates
that can be successfully developed and marketed. If our efforts do not lead to
the discovery of a suitable drug candidate, we may be unable to grow our
clinical pipeline or we may be unable to enter into agreements with
collaborators who are willing to develop our drug candidates.

The success of our drug discovery and development
efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully
exploit our capabilities. If we are unable to establish collaborations or if
these future collaborations are unsuccessful, our research and development
efforts may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

An important element of our business strategy will be
to enter into collaborative or license arrangements with other parties, such as
our collaboration with Pfizer, under which we license our drug candidates to
those parties for development and commercialization. We expect that while we
plan to conduct initial clinical trials on our drug candidates, we may need to
seek collaborators for our drug candidates such as our chemokine receptor antagonists
because of the expense, effort and expertise required to continue additional
clinical trials and further develop those drug candidates. We may also seek
collaborators for our drug candidates that target large primary care
indications such as diabetes because of the expense involved in further
clinical development of these indications and in establishing a sales and
marketing organization to address these indications. Because collaboration
arrangements are complex to negotiate, we may not be successful in our attempts
to establish these arrangements. Also, we may not have drug compounds that are
desirable to other parties, or we may be unwilling to license a drug compound
because the party interested in it is a competitor. The terms of any such arrangements
that we establish may not be favorable to us. Alternatively, potential
collaborators may decide against entering into an agreement with us because of
our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or for scientific,
commercial or other reasons. If we are not able to establish collaborative
agreements, we may not be able to develop and commercialize a drug product,
which would adversely affect our business and our revenues.

In order for any of these
collaboration or license arrangements to be successful, we must first identify
potential collaborators or licensees whose capabilities complement and
integrate well with ours. We may rely on these arrangements for not only
financial resources, but also for expertise or economies of scale that we
expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials, manufacturing, sales
and marketing, and for licenses to technology rights. However, it is likely
that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our
collaborators or licensees devote to our programs or potential products. If our
collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are less skilled than
we originally expected or do not devote adequate resources to the program, the
relationship will not be successful. If a business combination involving a
collaborator or licensees and a third party were to occur, the effect could be
to diminish, terminate or cause delays in development of a potential product.

We face significant competition for our drug discovery
and development efforts, and if we do not compete effectively, our commercial
opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.

The biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and
significant technological change. Our drug discovery and development efforts
may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing
therapies or that are being developed by our competitors, many of which have
substantially greater resources, larger research and development staffs and
facilities, more experience in completing preclinical testing and clinical
trials, and formulation, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. As a result
of these resources, our competitors may develop drug products that render our
products obsolete or noncompetitive by developing more effective drugs or by
developing their


products
more efficiently. Our ability to develop competitive products would be limited
if our competitors succeeded in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug
candidates more rapidly than we were able to or in obtaining patent protection
or other intellectual property rights that limited our drug development
efforts. Any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts, or from
our joint efforts with collaborators or licensees, might not be able to compete
successfully with our competitors’ existing and future products, or obtain
regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere.

We depend on our collaboration with Pfizer for the
development and commercialization of CCR2 antagonist compounds.

Under our collaborative research and license agreement
with Pfizer, Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights
to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer’s rights extend to the
full scope of potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis
and autoimmune nephritides.

Although Pfizer is required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize CCR2 antagonists for the
indications for which they are responsible, we cannot control the amount and
timing of resources Pfizer may devote to the development of CCR2 antagonists.
Any failure of Pfizer to perform its obligations under our agreement could
negatively impact the development of CCR2 antagonists, lead to our loss of potential
revenues from product sales and milestones and delay our achievement, if any,
of profitability.

Pfizer has certain rights
to terminate the license agreement, including the right to terminate upon 90
days’ notice for any reason. Pfizer also has the right to terminate its rights
and obligations with respect to certain indications. If Pfizer terminates the
license agreement or its rights with respect to certain indications, we may not
be able to find a new collaborator to replace Pfizer, and our business could be
adversely affected.

If conflicts arise between our collaborators,
including Pfizer, licensees, or advisors and us, our collaborators, licensees,
or advisors may act in their self-interest, which may adversely affect our
business.

If conflicts arise between us and our collaborators or
licensees, including Pfizer, or our scientific advisors, the other party may
act in its self-interest and not in the interest of our stockholders. Conflicts
may arise with our collaborators or licensees if they pursue alternative
technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in
collaboration with others as a means for developing treatments for the diseases
that we have targeted. Competing products, either developed by these future
collaborators or licensees or to which these future collaborators or licensees
have rights, may result in their withdrawal of support for our product
candidates.

Additionally, conflicts
may arise if there is a dispute about the achievement and payment of a
milestone amount or the ownership of intellectual property that is developed
during the course of the relationship. Similarly, the parties to a
collaboration or license agreement may disagree as to which party owns newly
developed products. Should an agreement be terminated as a result of a dispute
and before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration or license, our
reputation could be harmed and we may not obtain revenues that we anticipated
receiving.

If we fail to enter into additional licensing
agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our business and
operations might be adversely affected.

In addition to
establishing collaborative or license arrangements under which other parties
license our drug candidates for development and commercialization, we intend to
continue to explore opportunities to develop our clinical pipeline by
in-licensing drug compounds that fit within our expertise and research and
development capabilities. We may be unable to enter into any additional
in-licensing agreements because


suitable
product candidates that are within our expertise may not be available to us on
terms that are acceptable to us or because competitors with greater resources
seek to in-license the same product candidates. Product candidates that we
would like to develop may not be available to us because they are controlled by
competitors who are unwilling to license the rights to the drug compound or
candidate to us. In addition, we may enter into license agreements that are
unsuccessful and our business and operations might be adversely affected by the
termination of a drug candidate and termination and winding down of the related
license agreement. For example, in April 2006, we announced the
discontinuation of development of DFC and we gave notice of termination of our
collaborative license agreement with Pharmasset, Inc., which licensed DFC
to us. DFC was at the time our most advanced drug candidate. We may also need
to license drug delivery or other technology in order to continue to develop
our drug candidate pipeline. If we are unable to enter into additional
agreements to license drug candidates, drug delivery technology or other
technology or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our research and
development efforts could be adversely affected.

We have limited expertise with and capacity to conduct
preclinical testing and clinical trials, and our resulting dependence on other
parties could result in delays in and additional costs for our drug development
efforts.

We have only limited experience with clinical trials,
formulation, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. We also have
limited internal resources and capacity to perform preclinical testing and
clinical trials. As a result, we intend to hire Clinical Research
Organizations, or CROs, to perform preclinical testing and clinical trials for
drug candidates. If the CROs that we hire to perform our preclinical testing
and clinical trials or our collaborators or licensees do not meet deadlines, do
not follow proper procedures, or a conflict arises between us and our CROs, our
preclinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may be
delayed or may be terminated. If we were forced to find a replacement entity to
perform any of our preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not be able
to find a suitable entity on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we were able
to find another company to perform a preclinical test or clinical trial, the
delay in the test or trial may result in significant expenditures. Events such
as these may result in delays in our obtaining regulatory approval for our drug
candidates or our ability to commercialize our products and could result in
increased expenditures that would adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, for some of our
drug candidates, we plan to contract with collaborators or licensees to advance
those candidates through later-stage, more expensive clinical trials, rather
than invest our own resources to perform these clinical trials. Depending on
the terms of our agreements with these collaborators or licensees, we may not
have any control over the conduct of these clinical trials, and in any event we
would be subject to the risks associated with depending on collaborators or
licensees to develop these drug candidates.

If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to
develop and market products in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we
will not be permitted to manufacture or commercialize products resulting from
our research.

In order to manufacture and commercialize drug
products in the United States, our drug candidates will have to obtain
regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA.
Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years. To obtain
regulatory approval, we must first show that our drug products are safe and
effective for target indications through preclinical testing (animal testing)
and clinical trials (human testing). Preclinical testing and clinical
development are long, expensive and uncertain processes, and we do not know
whether the FDA will allow us to undertake clinical trials of any potential
drug products in addition to our compounds currently in clinical trials.


Completion of
clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of
testing. The length of time required varies substantially according to the
type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate. Interim
results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict
final results, and acceptable results in early clinical trials may not be
repeated in later clinical trials. For example, a drug candidate that is
successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or dangerous side effects
when tested at the clinical level. Our rate of commencement and completion of
clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:

·

the high degree of risk
associated with drug development;

·

our inability to formulate
or manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;

·

variability in the number
and types of patients available for each study;

·

difficulty in maintaining
contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;

·

unforeseen safety issues or
side effects;

·

poor or unanticipated
effectiveness of drug candidates during the clinical trials; or

·

government or regulatory
delays.

Data obtained from the clinical trials are susceptible
to varying interpretation, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory
approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including
biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced
clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier clinical
trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result
of other factors, such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of
product development and regulatory agency review. For example, the FDA has in
the past required and could in the future require that we conduct additional
trials of any of our product candidates, which would result in delays.

Due, in part, to the early stage of our drug candidate
research and development process, we cannot predict whether regulatory approval
will be obtained for any product we develop. Our drug candidates in clinical
trials are in early stage Phase I and Phase IIa trials. Our other drug
candidates are still undergoing preclinical testing. We have also licensed to
Pfizer our lead CCR2 antagonist; further clinical development of this compound,
which was in Phase IIa clinical trials at the time of licensing, is under
Pfizer’s control. Compounds developed by us, alone or with other parties, may
not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of
the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval. If
regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval will be limited to
those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated
through clinical trials to be safe and effective. Failure to obtain regulatory
approval would delay or prevent us from commercializing products.

Outside the United States,
our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing
authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. This foreign
regulatory approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with
the FDA approval process described above and may also include additional risks.

Our reliance on other parties to manufacture our drug
candidates could result in a short supply of the drugs, delays in development,
increased costs and withdrawal or denial of the regulatory authority’s
approval.

The FDA requires that drug products be manufactured
according to its current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations and
a limited number of manufacturers comply with these requirements. If the other
parties that we choose to manufacture our drug products are not compliant with
cGMP, the FDA may not approve our application to manufacture our drug products.
We may not be able to arrange for our products to be manufactured by one of
these parties on reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to comply with


cGMP in the manufacture of
our products could result in the FDA withdrawing or denying regulatory approval
of our drug product or other enforcement actions.

We may not be able to
obtain sufficient quantities of our new drug products if our designated
manufacturers do not have the capacity or capability to manufacture our
products according to our schedule and specifications. Also, raw materials that
may be required to manufacture any products we develop may only be available
from a limited number of suppliers. If we have promised delivery of a new
product and are unable to meet the delivery requirement due to manufacturing
difficulties, our development programs would be delayed, and we may have to
expend additional sums in order to ensure that manufacturing capacity is
available when we need it even if we do not use all of the manufacturing
capacity. This expense would adversely affect our operating results.
Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in
production, especially in scaling up initial production. These problems include
difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control and assurance
and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly
enforced federal, state and foreign regulations.  We may not be able to adequately manage and
oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may
terminate their agreements with us. Foreign manufacturing approval processes
typically include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process for
manufacturing and may also include additional risks.

We may incur
additional expense in order to market our drug products.

We do not have experience
marketing drug products. If the FDA grants regulatory approval to one or more
of our drug candidates, we would have to employ additional personnel or engage
another party to market our drug products, which would be an additional expense
to us.

We might not be able to commercialize our drug
candidates successfully, and we may spend significant time and money attempting
to do so.

We have a limited number
of drug candidates in early stage Phase I and Phase IIa clinical trials. We
have also licensed to Pfizer our lead CCR2 antagonist, which was in Phase IIa
clinical trials at the time of licensing. We, or our collaborators or
licensees, may decide to discontinue development of any or all of our drug
candidates at any time for commercial, scientific or other reasons. We
discontinued development of DFC in April 2006 for safety reasons. If a
product is developed, but is not marketed, we may have spent significant
amounts of time and money on it, which would adversely affect our operating results
and financial condition. Even if a drug candidate that we develop receives
regulatory approval, we may decide not to commercialize it if we determine that
commercialization of that product would require more money and time than we are
willing to invest. For example, drugs that receive approval are subject to
post-regulatory surveillance and may have to be withdrawn from the market if
previously unknown side effects occur. At this point, the regulatory agencies
may require additional clinical trials or testing. Once a drug is marketed, if
it causes side effects, the drug product may be recalled or may be subject to
reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling, warnings to the public
and negative publicity. As a result, we may not continue to commercialize a
product even though it has obtained regulatory approval. Further, we may decide
not to continue to commercialize a product if the market does not accept the
product because it is too expensive and third parties such as insurance
companies or Medicare have not approved it for substantial reimbursement. In
addition, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if another
product comes on the market that is as effective but has fewer side effects.
There is also a risk that competitors may develop similar or superior products
or have proprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our
products.


Our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if
we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement
from payors of healthcare costs.

The continuing efforts of government and insurance
companies, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and other payors of
healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our
future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of
our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative or license partners and
the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing
or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government
control. In the United States, given recent federal and state government
initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S.
Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care
reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the
Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such
legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or
adoption of these proposals could reduce the price that we or any of our
collaborators or licensees receive for any products in the future.

Our ability to
commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to
which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related
treatment are obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and
other organizations, such as HMOs. Third-party payors are increasingly
challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Also, the
trend toward managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth
of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence
the purchase of health care services and products, as well as legislative
proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs, may
all result in lower prices for or rejection of our products. The cost
containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and
the effect of any health care reform could materially and adversely affect our
ability to generate revenues.

As our drug discovery and development operations are
conducted at our headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the loss of access to
this facility would negatively impact our business.

Our facility in
Wilmington, Delaware is our headquarters and is also where we conduct all of
our drug discovery operations and research and development activities. Our
lease contains provisions that provide for its early termination upon the
occurrence of certain events of default or upon a change of control. Further,
our headquarters facility is located in a large research and development
complex that may be temporarily or permanently shutdown if certain
environmental or other hazardous conditions were to occur within the complex. In
addition, actions of activists opposed to aspects of pharmaceutical research
may disrupt our experiments or our ability to access or use our facilities. The
loss of access to or use of our Wilmington, Delaware, facility, either on a
temporary or permanent basis, or early termination of our lease would result in
an interruption of our business and, consequently, would adversely affect the
advancement of our drug discovery and development programs and our overall
business.

We depend on key employees in a competitive market for
skilled personnel, and the loss of the services of any of our key employees
would affect our ability to expand our drug discovery and development programs
and achieve our objectives.

We are highly dependent on
the principal members of our management, operations and scientific staff. We
experience intense competition for qualified personnel. Our future success also
depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team, key
scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit, train and
retain essential scientific personnel for our drug discovery and development
programs, including those who will be responsible for overseeing our
preclinical testing and clinical trials as well as for the establishment of
collaborations with other companies. If we lose the services of any of these
people, our research and product development goals, including the
identification and establishment of key


collaborations,
operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed. We do not
maintain “key person” insurance on any of our employees.

We may encounter difficulties in integrating companies
we acquire, which may harm our operations and financial results.

As part of our
business strategy, we have in the past and may in the future acquire assets,
technologies, compounds and businesses. Our past acquisitions, such as the
acquisition of Maxia have involved, and our future acquisitions may involve,
risks such as the following:

·

we may be exposed to
unknown liabilities of acquired companies;

·

our acquisition and
integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly
and annual operating results to fluctuate;

·

we may experience
difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired
businesses, disrupting our business and diverting our management’s time and
attention;

·

we may be unable to
integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology,
compounds or drug candidates;

·

we may experience
difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls,
procedures and policies;

·

our relationships with key
customers, suppliers, or collaborative or license partners of acquired
businesses may be impaired, due to changes in management and ownership of the
acquired businesses;

·

we may be unable to retain
key employees of the acquired businesses;

·

we may incur amortization
or impairment expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or
other intangible assets; or

·

our stockholders may be
diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities.

In addition, if we acquire
additional businesses that are not located near our new headquarters, we may
experience more difficulty integrating and managing the acquired businesses’
operations.

If product liability lawsuits are brought against us,
we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit
commercialization of our products and our results of operations could be
harmed.

The clinical trials and
marketing of medical products that are intended for human use entails an
inherent risk of product liability. If any product that we or any of our
collaborators or licensees develops causes or is alleged to cause injury or is
found to be unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing or sale, we may be
held liable. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product
liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities, including substantial
damages to be paid to the plaintiffs and legal costs, or we may be required to
limit commercialization of our products. Our product liability insurance
policy that provides coverage for liabilities arising from our clinical trials
may not fully cover our potential liabilities. In addition, we may determine
that we should increase our coverage upon the undertaking of new clinical
trials, and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our
collaborators or licensees and may not fully cover our potential liabilities.
Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable
cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or
inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or
with our collaborators. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause
injury to our reputation, recall of products, participants to withdraw from
clinical trials, and potential collaborators or licensees to seek other
partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.


Because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials,
we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal
of these materials that could be time consuming and costly.

We are subject to various
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other
things, the use, handling, storage and disposal of regulated substances and the
health and safety of our employees. Our research and development processes
involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and
biological waste resulting in the production of hazardous waste products. We
cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge
and any resultant injury from these materials. If any injury or contamination
results from our use or the use by our collaborators or licensees of these
materials, we may be sued and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage
and our total assets. Further, we may be required to indemnify our
collaborators or licensees against all damages and other liabilities arising
out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these
collaborations or licenses. Compliance with the applicable environmental and
workplace laws and regulations is expensive. Future changes to environmental,
health, workplace and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or
may restrict our operations or impair our research, development and production
efforts.

RISKS RELATING TO
OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

We expect to incur
losses in the future and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the
future.

We had net losses from inception in 1991 through 1996
and in 1999 through 2006. Because of those losses, we had an accumulated
deficit of $913.5 million as of December 31, 2006. We will continue to
spend significant amounts on our efforts to discover and develop drugs. As a
result, we expect to continue to incur losses in 2007 and in future periods as
well.

We anticipate that our
drug discovery and development efforts will increase as we focus on the
studies, including preclinical tests and clinical trials prior to seeking
regulatory approval, that are required before we can sell a drug product. The
development of drug products will require us to spend significant funds on
research, development, testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing
and marketing. To date, we do not have any drug products that have generated
revenues and we cannot assure you that we will generate revenues from the drug
candidates that we license or develop for several years, if ever. We cannot be
certain whether or when we will achieve profitability because of the
significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate commercially
successful drug products. Even if we were successful in obtaining regulatory
approvals for manufacturing and commercializing a drug candidate, we expect
that we will continue to incur losses if our drug products do not generate
significant revenues. If we achieve profitability we may not be able to sustain
or increase profitability.

We will need
additional capital in the future. The capital markets may not permit us to
raise additional capital at the time that we require it, which could result in
limitations on our research and development or commercialization efforts or the
loss of certain of our rights in our technologies or drug candidates.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many
factors and we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund
our business plan and research and development efforts on a going-forward
basis.

Additional factors
that may affect our future funding requirements include:

·

any changes in the breadth
of our research and development programs;

·

the results of research and
development, preclinical testing and clinical trials conducted by us or our
future collaborative partners or licensees, if any;

·

the acquisition or
licensing of businesses, technologies or compounds, if any;


·

our ability to maintain and
establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations;

·

competing technological and
market developments;

·

the amount of revenues
generated from our business activities, if any;

·

the time and costs involved
in filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent and intellectual
property claims;

·

the receipt of contingent
licensing or milestone fees or royalties on product sales from our current or
future collaborative and license arrangements, if established; and

·

the timing of regulatory
approvals, if any.

If we require additional
capital at a time when investment in companies such as ours, or in the
marketplace generally, is limited due to the then prevailing market or other
conditions, we may have to scale back our operations, eliminate one or more of
our research or development programs, or attempt to obtain funds by entering
into an agreement with a collaborative partner that would result in terms that
are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our
proprietary technologies or drug candidates. If we are unable to raise funds at
the time that we desire or at any time thereafter on acceptable terms, we may
not be able to continue to develop our potential drug products. The sale of
equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future would be
dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to
pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our
operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness.

Our current revenues are derived from collaborations
and from licensing our intellectual property. If we are unable to achieve
milestones, develop products or renew or enter into new collaborations, our
revenues may decrease, and future milestone and royalty payments from our gene
and genomics-related intellectual property may not contribute significantly to
revenues for several years, and may never result in revenues.

We derived substantially
all of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 from our
collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer and from licensing our
intellectual property to others. We may be unable to enter into additional
collaborative agreements. Revenues from research and development collaborations
depend upon continuation of the collaborations, the achievement of milestones
and royalties we earn from any future products developed from our research. If
we are unable to successfully achieve milestones or our collaborators fail to
develop successful products, we will not earn the revenues contemplated under
our collaborative agreements. Part of our prior strategy was to license to
our database customers and to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
our know-how and patent rights associated with the information we have
generated in the creation of our proprietary databases, for use in the
discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical, diagnostic or other
products. Any potential product that is the subject of such a license will
require several years of further development, clinical trials and regulatory
approval before commercialization, all of which is beyond our control, and
possibly beyond the control of our licensee. These licensees may not develop
the potential product if they do not devote the necessary resources or decide
that they do not want to expend the resources to do the clinical trials
necessary to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Therefore, milestone or
royalty payments from these licenses may not contribute to our revenues for
several years, if at all. We have decided to discontinue some of our gene and
genomics-related patent prosecution and maintenance, and may in the future
decide to discontinue additional gene and genomics-related patent prosecution
and maintenance, which could limit our ability to receive license-based
revenues from our gene and genomics-related patent portfolio.


Our investments may
decline in value and our losses may increase.

We have made and
may in the future make investments in entities that complement our business.
These investments may:

·

often be made in securities
lacking a public trading market or subject to trading restrictions, either of
which increases our risk and reduces the liquidity of our investment;

·

require us to record losses
and expenses related to our ownership interest;

·

require us to record
acquisition-related charges, such as in-process research and development;

·

require us to record
charges related to the impairment in the value of the securities underlying our
investment; and

·

require us to invest
greater amounts than anticipated or to devote substantial management time to
the management of research and development relationships or other
relationships.

The market values of many
of these investments can fluctuate significantly. We evaluate our long-term
investments for impairment of their value on a quarterly basis. The value of
our investments in private companies can fluctuate significantly. In past
periods, market conditions have caused us to write-down the value of our private
company investments, sometimes substantially, and market conditions may cause
us to write down additional amounts. In addition, we have in the past written
down the value of our debt investments in companies experiencing financial
difficulties.

We have a large amount of debt and our debt service
obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider
to be in our best interests.

As of December 31,
2006, the aggregate principal amount of total consolidated debt was
$411.8 million and our stockholders’ deficit was $84.9 million. The
indentures pursuant to which our outstanding convertible senior and
subordinated notes were issued do not limit the issuance of additional
indebtedness. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative
consequences for our future operations, including:

·

increasing our
vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

·

limiting our ability to
obtain additional financing for working capital, capital and research and
development expenditures, and general corporate purposes;

·

requiring the dedication of
a substantial portion of our expected cash flow or our existing cash to service
our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash available for other
purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and research and
development expenditures;

·

limiting our flexibility in
planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which
we compete; or

·

placing us at a possible
competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors
that have better access to capital resources.

In the past five years, we
have had negative cash flow from operations. We likely will not generate
sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to enable us to meet our
anticipated fixed charges, including our debt service requirements with respect
to our outstanding convertible senior notes and convertible subordinated notes.
As of December 31, 2006, $151.8 million aggregate principal amount of our
3½% convertible senior notes due 2011 was outstanding. Our annual interest
payments, beginning in 2007, for the 3½% 
convertible senior notes through 2010, assuming none of these notes are
converted, redeemed, repurchased or exchanged, are $5.3 million, and an
additional $2.7 million in interest is payable in 2011. As of December 31,
2006, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3½% convertible


subordinated
notes due 2011 was outstanding. Our annual interest payments for the 3½%
convertible subordinated notes through 2010, assuming none of these notes are
converted, redeemed, repurchased or exchanged, are $8.8 million, and an
additional $4.4 million in interest is payable in 2011. As of December 31,
2006, we also had outstanding the $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of
the convertible subordinated note held by Pfizer, which is due in 2013 but does
not bear interest. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or
raise additional cash through financings sufficient to meet these obligations,
we will need to use existing cash or liquidate marketable securities in order
to fund these obligations, which may delay or curtail our research, development
and commercialization programs.

RISKS RELATING TO
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LEGAL MATTERS

If we are subject to arbitration, litigation and
infringement claims, they could be costly and disrupt our drug discovery and
development efforts.

The technology that we use to make and develop our
drug products, the technology that we incorporate in our products, and the
products we are developing may be subject to claims that they infringe the
patents or proprietary rights of others. The success of our drug discovery and
development efforts will also depend on our ability to develop new compounds, drugs
and technologies without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights
of others. We are aware of patents and patent applications filed in certain
countries claiming certain intellectual property relating to certain drug
discovery targets such as CCR5. While the validity of issued patents,
patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them
to our programs are uncertain, if any of these patents are asserted against us,
our ability to commercialize our products could be harmed.

From time to time we may receive notices from third
parties offering licenses to technology or alleging patent, trademark, or
copyright infringement, claims regarding trade secrets or other contract
claims. Receipt of these notices could result in significant costs as a result
of the diversion of the attention of management from our drug discovery and
development efforts. No third party has a current filed patent lawsuit or
arbitration against us. If a successful claim were brought against us, we would
have to attempt to license the technology from the claimant or to spend time
and money to design around the technology. Any such license of the technology
may not be available at reasonable terms, or at all.

We may, however, be
involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent
infringement or other intellectual property rights or contract violations. In
addition, litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to:

·

assert claims of
infringement;

·

enforce our patents or
trademarks;

·

protect our trade secrets
or know-how; or

·

determine the
enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.

We may be unsuccessful in
defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims. Regardless of the outcome,
litigation can be very costly and can divert management’s efforts. For example,
we recently settled patent litigation with Invitrogen Corporation. We incurred
significant expenses related to this litigation and, as part of the settlement,
paid Invitrogen $3.4 million. An adverse determination may subject us to
significant liabilities or require us or our collaborators or licensees to seek
licenses to other parties’ patents or proprietary rights. We or our
collaborators or licensees may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing
or selling a drug product that we develop. Further, we or our future
collaborators or licensees may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on
acceptable terms, if at all.


We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our
proprietary information, which may result in its unauthorized use, a loss of
revenue under a collaboration agreement or loss of sales to generic versions of
our products or otherwise reduce our ability to compete.

Our business and competitive position depend in part upon
our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including any drug products
that we create. Despite our efforts to protect this information, unauthorized
parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as
proprietary. For example, one of our collaborators may disclose proprietary
information pertaining to our drug discovery efforts. Any patents issued in
connection with our drug discovery efforts may not be broad enough to protect
all of the potential uses of the product.

Additionally, when we do not control the prosecution,
maintenance and enforcement of certain important intellectual property, such as
a drug compound in-licensed to us or subject to a collaboration with a third
party, the protection of the intellectual property rights may not be in our
hands. If we do not control the intellectual property rights in-licensed to us
with respect to a compound and the entity that controls the intellectual
property rights does not adequately protect those rights, our rights may be
impaired, which may impact our ability to develop, market and commercialize the
in-licensed compound.

Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not
be adequate, and our competitors may:

·

independently develop
substantially equivalent proprietary information, products and techniques;

·

otherwise gain access to
our proprietary information; or

·

design around patents
issued to us or our other intellectual property.

We pursue a policy of
having our employees, consultants and advisors execute proprietary information
and invention agreements when they begin working for us. However, these
agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other
proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. If we
fail to maintain trade secret and patent protection, our potential, future
revenues may be decreased.

If the effective term of our patents is decreased due
to changes in the United States patent laws or if we need to refile some of our
patent applications, the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we
derive from it may be decreased.

The value of our patents
depends in part on their duration. A shorter period of patent protection could
lessen the value of our rights under any patents that we obtain and may
decrease the revenues we derive from our patents. The United States patent laws
were amended in 1995 to change the term of patent protection from 17 years
from patent issuance to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the
application. Because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology
applications may be more than three years depending on the subject matter, a 20-year
patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent
protection. Also, we may need to refile some of our applications filed before
1995 that claim large numbers of genes or other additional subject matter and,
in these situations, the patent term will be measured from the date of the
earliest priority application. This would shorten our period of patent exclusivity
and may decrease the revenues that we might derive from the patents.

International patent protection is particularly
uncertain and costly, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in
foreign countries, we may have to expend substantial sums and management
resources.

Biotechnology and
pharmaceutical patent law outside the United States is even more uncertain and
costly than in the United States and is currently undergoing review and
revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not
protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States
laws. For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are
directed to


the
treatment of humans. We may participate in opposition proceedings to determine
the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors’ foreign patents, which
could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters
is in Wilmington, Delaware, which is where our drug discovery and development
operations are also located. These facilities are leased to us until September 2008,
and we have options to renew our lease until September 2010. We believe
that these facilities are adequate to meet our business requirements for the
near-term and that additional space will be available on commercially
reasonable terms, if required. In addition to this lease, we had lease
agreements as of December 31, 2006 for facilities that were closed as a
part of the restructurings of our genomic information business in Palo Alto and
San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2006, we had multiple sublease
and lease agreements covering approximately 271,000 square feet that expire on
various dates ranging from June 2007 to March 2011. Of the
approximately 271,000 square feet leased, approximately 174,000 square feet of
this space has been vacated by us and is currently subleased to others.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be
read in conjunction with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this
Report.

Overview

Incyte is a

drug
discovery and development company focused on developing proprietary small
molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline with
programs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diabetes, oncology and
inflammation.

Thus far in our drug discovery and development
activities, which began in early 2002, we have taken five internally developed
compounds into clinical development, and have progressed four of these
compounds into Phase II clinical trials. Of the four compounds progressed into
Phase II clinical trials, the first was from our CCR2 program for inflammatory
diseases, which is now the basis of a broad collaboration with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”)
established in January 2006, the second is our sheddase inhibitor from our
most advanced oncology program, the third is our lead CCR5 antagonist for HIV
and the fourth is our lead 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1,
more commonly called 11

β

HSD1, inhibitor for type 2
diabetes.

Incyte’s
wholly-owned pipeline includes the following compounds:

Inflammation

Preclinical

In April 2006, we announced that we were
discontinuing the development of dexelvucitabine or DFC (formerly known as
Reverset), a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor that we
in-licensed from Pharmasset, Inc. At the time, this compound was in Phase
IIb development as a treatment for HIV.

During 2006, we
filed four Investigational New Drug applications (INDs):

·

one
for our lead CCR5 compound that is now in Phase IIa clinical trials;

·

a
second for our lead 11

β

HSD1 inhibitor for type 2 diabetes that
is also in Phase IIa clinical trials;


·

a
third for a follow-on CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I development; and

·

a
fourth for a CCR2 antagonist for multiple sclerosis.

We expect to file additional INDs in the first half of
2007 for a new program targeting Janus-associated kinases (JAK). We believe our
orally available JAK inhibitors have potential in chronic inflammatory
conditions, myeloproliferative disorders and certain cancers.

We anticipate incurring
additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and
development programs. We also expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to
quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial.

Conducting clinical trials for our drug
candidates in development is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. We
do not expect to generate product sales from our drug discovery and development
efforts for several years, if at all. If we are unable to successfully develop
and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years, our business,
financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted.

Collaborative Research and License Agreement with
Pfizer

Effective in January 2006,
we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the
pursuit of our CCR2 antagonist program. We received an upfront nonrefundable
payment of $40.0 million in January 2006, $10.0 million was received
through the purchase of a convertible subordinated note (the “Pfizer Note”) in February 2006
and we are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone
payments of up to $743.0 million for the successful development and
commercialization of CCR2 antagonists in multiple indications, as well as
royalties on worldwide sales. Pfizer gained worldwide development and
commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds, the
most advanced of which was in Phase IIa clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis
and insulin-resistant obese patients at the time the agreement became effective
in January 2006. Pfizer’s rights extend to the full scope of potential
indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and lupus nephritis and
other autoimmune nephritides, for which we retained worldwide rights, along
with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on preclinical
development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. At our
option, prior to September 28, 2007, once we are able to initiate

Phase I clinical trials of a CCR2
antagonist in a retained Incyte indication, Pfizer may purchase from us an
additional $10.0 million convertible subordinated note.

Restructuring Programs

In February 2004, we made the decision to
discontinue further development of the information products, close our Palo
Alto headquarters and focus solely on the discovery and development of novel
drugs. We recorded $42.1 million in restructuring charges in 2004, including
charges related to the closure of our facilities, prior tenant improvements and
equipment, a workforce reduction and other items. The restructuring charge
originally included the present value of future lease obligations for two
facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we made a lease termination payment
to satisfy our remaining lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities.
The lease obligation for the second facility extends through March 2011. As
a result of the long term nature of the remaining lease obligation, we will be
recording a charge each period through the March 2011 termination date of
the lease related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations in
accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities, which total approximately $1.4 million at December 31, 2006. The
cash impact in 2006 from restructuring related charges was $6.1 million.

In December 2004,
based on declining estimated future cash flows associated with our gene and
genomics-related intellectual property, we recorded a charge of $12.1 million
to adjust the carrying value of previously capitalized costs associated with
the preparation, prosecution and maintenance of our gene


patent
portfolio to its estimated fair market value. In January 2005 we sold certain
assets and liabilities related to our Proteome facility in Beverly,
Massachusetts. Our consolidated financial statements have been restated to
present the operations of our Proteome facility as a discontinued operation.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Significant Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires us to
make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

We believe the
following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

·

Revenue recognition;

·

Research and development
costs;

·

Valuation of long-lived
assets;

·

Accounting for long-term
investments;

·

Restructuring charges; and

·

Stock compensation.

Revenue Recognition.

Revenues are recognized
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. We have entered into various types of
agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual
property. Revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no
further obligations exist. We exercise judgment in determining that
collectibility is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in
accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and
whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility
based primarily on the customer’s payment history and on the creditworthiness
of the customer.

Revenues from ongoing database agreements are
recognized evenly over the access period. Revenues from licenses to our
intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related
agreements. Royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or
services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We
estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received and
information provided by the third party licensee. We exercise judgment in
determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently
reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon.

Under agreements involving multiple products, services
and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate
units of accounting when certain criteria are met, including whether the
delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When
separate units of accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the
separate elements based on their respective fair values. The determination of
fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales
of the individual elements by us to other customers. If such evidence of fair
value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all
revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair
value for each


undelivered element does
exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. When elements are
specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when
the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed. When
revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings
process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.

In connection with our collaborative research and
license agreement with Pfizer, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of
$40.0 million in January 2006. The $40.0 million upfront fee was recorded
as deferred revenue and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over two
years, our estimated performance period under the agreement. Pfizer also
purchased the Pfizer Note for $10.0 million from us in February 2006. As
the Pfizer Note is non-interest bearing, it has been discounted to its net
present value. The difference between the cash received and the present value
of the Pfizer Note in the amount of $3.2 million represents additional
consideration from Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this
additional consideration as deferred revenue and will recognize it over two
years, our estimated performance period under the agreement. We recognize
contract revenues in connection with research services provided to Pfizer as
earned.  Future development and milestone
payments will be recognized as earned.

Research and
Development Costs.

In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 (“SFAS 2”),

Accounting for Research and Development Costs

, it is our
policy to expense research and development costs as incurred. We often contract
with clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to facilitate, coordinate and
perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that
research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we record monthly
accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work
performed under the contract.

These CRO contracts typically call for the payment of
fees for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement
of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event that we prepay CRO fees for
future milestones, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the
asset into research and development expense over the period of time the
contracted research and development services are performed. Most professional
fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring,
and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. These
professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a
particular date.

Our CRO contracts generally include pass through fees.
Pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses,
investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous costs including
shipping and printing fees. Because these fees are incurred at various times
during the contract term and they are used throughout the contract term, we
record a monthly expense allocation to recognize the fees during the contract
period. Fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the
setup period.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.

We assess the
impairment of long-lived assets, which includes property and equipment as well
as intangible and other assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider
important that could indicate the need for an impairment review include the
following:

·

Significant changes in the
strategy of our overall business;

·

Significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating
results;

·

Significant changes in the
manner of use of the acquired assets;

·

Significant negative
industry or economic trends;

·

Significant decline in our
stock price for a sustained period; and

·

Our market capitalization
relative to net book value.


When we determine that the carrying value of
long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or
more of the above indicators of impairment, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long
Lived Assets

(“SFAS 144”), we
perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists. If
impairment exists, we measure the impairment based on the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and its fair value.

Accounting for
Long-Term Investments.

Our long-term
investments have historically consisted of investments in both privately and
publicly-held companies in which we have owned less than 20% of the outstanding
voting stock and have not had the ability to exert significant influence over
the investees. Accordingly, our long-term investments in privately-held
companies have been accounted for under the cost method and our investments in
publicly-held companies have been accounted for in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities

. Our investments in publicly-held companies
are classified as available-for-sale and are adjusted to their fair value each
period based on their quoted market price with any adjustments being recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity (deficit).

We periodically
evaluate the carrying value of our ownership interests in privately-held cost
method investees by reviewing conditions that might indicate an other-than
temporary decline in fair value, including the following:

·

Financial performance of
the investee;

·

Achievement of business
plan objectives and milestones including the hiring of key employees, obtaining
key business partnerships, and progress related to research and development
activities;

·

Available cash; and

·

Completion of debt and
equity financings.

If our review of these factors indicates that an
other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the investee has occurred, we
estimate the fair value of the investee. When the carrying value of our
investments is materially greater than our pro-rata share of the estimated fair
value of the investee, we record an impairment charge to reduce our carrying
value. Impairment charges are recorded in the period when the related
triggering condition becomes known to management. We use the best information
available in performing our periodic evaluations; however, the information
available may be limited. These evaluations involve significant management
judgment, and the actual amounts realized for a specific investment may differ
from the carrying value. For our available-for-sale investments in
publicly-held investees, we monitor all unrealized losses to determine whether
a decline in fair value below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Generally,
when fair value is materially less than carrying value for six consecutive
months, we consider the decline to be other-than-temporary. When we conclude
that a decline is other-than-temporary, we adjust the carrying value of our
long-term investments in publicly-held investees so that our carrying value per
share is equal to the quoted market price per share. Future adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could
result in additional impairment charges.

Restructuring
Charges.

Costs associated with restructuring
activities initiated after December 31, 2002, are accounted for in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities

(“SFAS
146”). Costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to December 31,
2002 have been recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring)

(“EITF 94-3”)
and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

(“SAB 100”). Restructuring costs resulting from the acquisition of Maxia
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Maxia”) have been recorded in accordance with EITF
Issue No. 95-3

, Recognition of
Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination

(“EITF 95-3”). The


restructuring charges are
comprised primarily of costs to exit facilities, reduce our workforce,
write-off fixed assets, and pay for outside services incurred in the
restructuring. The workforce reduction charge is determined based on the
estimated severance and fringe benefit charge for identified employees. In
calculating the cost to exit the facilities, we estimate for each location the
amount to be paid in lease termination payments, the future lease and operating
costs to be paid until the lease is terminated, the amount, if any, of sublease
receipts and real estate broker fees. This requires us to estimate the timing
and costs of each lease to be terminated, the amount of operating costs, and
the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site. To form our
estimates for these costs, we perform an assessment of the affected facilities
and consider the current market conditions for each site. We also estimate our
credit adjusted risk free interest rate in order to discount our projected
lease payments in accordance with SFAS 146. Estimates are also used in our
calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that is being held
for sale. These estimates are formed based on recent history of sales of
similar equipment and market conditions. Our assumptions on either the lease
termination payments, operating costs until terminated, the offsetting sublease
receipts and estimated realizable value of fixed assets held for sale may turn
out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our
estimates. Our estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring us to
record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities
recorded.

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the
remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy, that no excess accruals
are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended
purposes in accordance with developed exit plans. We periodically evaluate
current available information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary.
We also make adjustments related to accrued professional fees to adjust
estimated amounts to actual. For the year ended December 31, 2006, such
adjustments were made for the 2002 restructuring program, 2004 restructuring
program, and the acquisition of Maxia.

Stock Compensation.

Effective January 1,
2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004) (“SFAS 123R”),

Share-Based Payment

, which revised
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (“SFAS 123”),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

.
SFAS 123R requires all share-based payment transactions with employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation
expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values. SFAS
123R is a new and complex accounting standard, the application of which
requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly
surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and
expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture rates, to value
equity-based compensation. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair value
of stock compensation in the statement of operations. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options
was not recognized in the statement of operations. Prior to January 1,
2006, we had adopted the disclosure-only provisions under SFAS 123. Under the
provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $8.9 million of stock compensation expense
on our audited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2006. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, our net loss
for the year ended December 31, 2006, 
is $8.9 million higher than if we had continued to account for
share-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

Basic and diluted net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2006
are $0.11 higher than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation
under APB Opinion No. 25

.

For
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 we recorded stock compensation
expense of $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively on our audited condensed
consolidated statement of operations related to restricted shares issued to our
Chief Executive Officer.


Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31,
2006 and 2005

We recorded net losses
from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
of $74.2 million and $103.4 million, respectively. On a basic and diluted per
share basis, net loss from continuing operations was $0.89 and $1.24 for the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

$24.2 million and $0.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Contract
revenues were derived from recognition of revenue associated with the Pfizer
$40.0 million upfront fee, recognition of revenue associated with the debt
discount and beneficial conversion feature related to the Pfizer Note, and
research services provided to Pfizer.

Our license and royalty
revenues were $3.4 million and $7.8 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. License
and royalty revenues were derived from database subscriptions and licensing of
our gene- and genomic-related intellectual property. The decrease in license
and royalty revenues from 2005 to 2006 is attributable to our decision to
discontinue offering information products. We expect that revenues generated
from information products, including licensing of gene- and genomic-related
intellectual property, will continue to decline as we focus on our drug
discovery and development programs.

For the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005 revenues from companies considered to be related parties, as
defined by FASB Statement No. 57,

Related Party Disclosures

(“SFAS 57”) were $0.3 million and $0.0
million, respectively. Our related parties consist of companies in which
members of our Board of Directors have invested, either directly or indirectly,
or in which a member of our Board of Directors is an officer or holds a seat on
the Board of Directors (other than an Incyte-held Board seat).

The above transactions
were recorded at fair value in accordance with our revenue and expense
recognition policies.

We currently track

Stock compensation costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 was the
result of our adoption of SFAS 123R which required the recognition of
stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Stock
compensation expense may fluctuate from period to period based on the number of


options
granted, stock price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected
option forfeiture rates which are used to value equity-based compensation. The
decrease in collaboration and outside services from 2005 to 2006 is due
primarily the result of decreased drug discovery and development costs due to
our collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer and the decision
in April 2006 to discontinue the development of our DFC program. The
decrease in occupancy and other costs from 2005 to 2006 was primarily the
result of increased efficiency in our use of laboratory and reagent supplies.

Research and development
expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of
certain projects and the level of preclinical and clinical trial-related
activities

.

Many factors can affect the cost and
timing of our clinical trials, including inconclusive results requiring
additional clinical trials, slow patient enrollment, adverse side effects among
patients, the availability of supplies for our clinical trials and real or
perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our
clinical trials. In addition, the development of all of our product candidates
will be subject to extensive governmental regulation. These factors make it
difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and
approval of our products.

Stock compensation costs
for the year ended December 31, 2006 was the result of our adoption of

consolidated statement of operations. Stock compensation expense may fluctuate
from period to period based on the number of options granted, stock price
volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option forfeiture
rates which are used to value equity-based compensation.

Other expenses.

Other expenses for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005 were $2.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  The increase from 2005 to 2006 is due
primarily to the settlement agreement with Invitrogen related to our
discontinued genomic information business which resulted in a $3.4 million
charge recorded in other expenses. This settlement resolved all outstanding
claims included in the litigation.

In 2006, we recorded $1.0
million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $(1.5)
million of benefit in connection with our 2002 restructuring program and a
facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia. In 2005, we
recorded $1.0 million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring
program and $0.4 million of expense in connection with our 2002 restructuring
program and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia.

Other income
(expense)

Interest and other income
(expense), net.

Interest and other income (expense),
net, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $20.7 million and
$12.5 million, respectively. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily
attributable to the $6.2 million realized gain recorded from the sale of our
investment in a publicly-held company in March 2006 and due to higher
interest rates in 2006 offset by an impairment charge of $1.3 million recorded
in June 2006 to reduce the carrying value of our investment in a
privately-held investee. In  2005 we realized
a $2.8 million gain from the sale of securities of a strategic investee.


Interest expense.

Interest expense for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $17.9 million and
$16.1 million, respectively. The increase in 2006 from 2005 is primarily attributable
to the accretion of $2.1 million of the discount related to the 3½% convertible
senior notes due 2011 (the “3½% Senior Notes”) issued in September 2006.

Gain (loss) on
redemption/repurchase of convertible subordinated notes.

In 2006 we
redeemed $91.6 million principal amount and in 2005 we repurchased, on the open
market, $36.5 million face value of our 5.5% convertible subordinated notes due
2007 (the “5.5% Notes”). The redemption and repurchase resulted in a gain
(loss) of $(0.1) million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005.

Provision (benefit) for
income taxes.

Due to our net losses in 2006 and
2005, we had a minimal effective annual income tax rate. The benefit for income
taxes for 2005 is primarily attributable to foreign withholding taxes.

Gain from discontinued
operation.

The gain from discontinued operation
of $0.3 million in 2005 represents the gain on sale of our Proteome facility
based in Beverly, Massachusetts. In December 2004, we entered into an
agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to our Proteome
facility, which transaction subsequently closed in January 2005. The
consolidated financial statements have been restated to present the operations
of our Proteome facility as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

Years Ended December 31,
2005 and 2004

We recorded net losses from
continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of
$103.4 million and $163.7 million, respectively. On a basic and diluted per
share basis, net loss from continuing operations was $1.24 and $2.19 for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Our revenues of $7.8
million and $14.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively were derived primarily
from information products, which included database subscriptions, licensing of
our intellectual property, and partner programs. The decrease in revenues from
2004 to 2005 was due primarily to the 2004 closure of our Palo Alto, California
facility and the decision to discontinue offering information products.

For the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 revenues from companies considered to be related parties, as
defined by SFAS 57 were $0.0 million and $1.1 million.

Revenues received from
agreements with customers in which we have an equity interest were $0.0 million
and $1.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Revenues recognized from
transactions in which there was originally a concurrent commitment to purchase
goods or services from the other party to the transaction for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 were $0.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. No new
transactions in which we had a concurrent commitment to purchase goods or
services from the other party to the transaction were entered into during the
year ended December 31, 2005. Of commitments made in prior periods, we
expensed $0.0 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

The above transactions
were recorded at fair value in accordance with our revenue and expense
recognition policies.

The decrease in salary and

headcount. The number of employees engaged in research and development
activities declined due to the closure of our Palo Alto facility in 2004 and
the cessation of the development of the information products developed at this
facility. We expect that there will be no further research and development
related to our information business. The increase in collaboration and outside
services from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily to our increased efforts in our
drug discovery and development, the expansion of clinical trials for our
compounds and additional preclinical expenditures for potential pharmaceutical
candidates partially offset by reduced expenditures related to our information
business. The decrease in occupancy and other costs from 2004 to 2005 is due
primarily to the reduction in our facility costs resulting from the closure of
our Palo Alto facility in 2004.

The decrease in salary and

contract and outside costs from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily to the closure of
Palo Alto and the elimination of expenses through our restructuring programs.

Other expenses.

Other expenses for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 were $1.4 million and $54.2 million, respectively, and
represent charges recorded in connection with restructuring and long-lived
asset impairments.

In 2005, we recorded $1.0
million of expense in connection with our 2004 restructuring program and $0.4
million of expense in connection with our 2002 restructuring program and a
facility closed in connection with our acquisition of Maxia.

In 2004, in conjunction
with our 2004 restructuring program, we recorded $39.0 million in expense,
including charges related to the closure of our Palo Alto facility, previously
capitalized tenant improvements and equipment, a workforce reduction and other
items. In December 2004, based on declining estimated future cash flows
associated with our gene and genomics-related intellectual property, we
recorded a charge of $12.1 million to adjust the carrying value of previously
capitalized costs associated with the preparation, prosecution and maintenance
of our gene patent portfolio to its estimated fair


market
value. During 2004, we also recorded charges of $3.1 million related primarily
to a reduction in estimated sublease income for a facility closed in connection
with our 2002 restructuring program and a facility closed in connection with
our acquisition of Maxia.

Other income
(expense)

Interest and other income
(expense), net.

Interest and other income (expense),
net, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $12.5 million and
$3.6 million, respectively. The increase in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to
higher interest rates in 2005, a $2.8 million gain from the 2005 sale of
securities of a strategic investee and a $5.2 million decline in long-term
investment impairment charges from 2004 to 2005, partially offset by a lower
average cash balance.

Interest expense.

Interest
expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was
$16.1 million and $17.2 million, respectively. The decrease in 2005
from 2004 is related to lower interest expense associated with our  2005 repurchase of $36.5 million face value
of our 5.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2007.

Losses on certain
derivative financial instruments.

Losses on
certain derivative financial instruments for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 of $0.1 million, and $0.5 million, respectively, represents the
change in fair value of certain long-term investments, specifically warrants
held in other companies, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and
Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”). Gain or loss on derivative
financial instruments may fluctuate in any given period based upon current
market conditions and is recognized during the period of change.

Gain (loss) on repurchase
of convertible subordinated notes.

In 2005 and
2004 we repurchased $36.5 million and $38.4 million face value, respectively,
of the 5.5% Notes on the open market. The repurchase resulted in a gain of $0.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and a loss of $0.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Provision (benefit) for
income taxes.

Due to our net losses in 2005 and
2004, we had a minimal effective annual income tax rate. The provision
(benefit) for income taxes for 2005 and 2004 are primarily attributable to
foreign withholding taxes.

Gain (loss) from
discontinued  operation.

The gain from
discontinued operation of $0.3 million in 2005 and loss from discontinued
operation of $1.2 million in 2004 respectively, represent the results of our
Proteome facility based in Beverly, Massachusetts. In December 2004, we
entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to our
Proteome facility, which transaction subsequently closed in January 2005. The
consolidated financial statements have been restated to present the operations
of our Proteome facility as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN
48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do
not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2005, the
FASB issued staff position FAS 115-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain
Investments

(“FSP 115-1”).
FSP 115-1 addresses the determination as to when an investment is
considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary and the
measurement of an impairment loss. FSP 115-1 also includes accounting
considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures


about
unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary
impairments. The guidance in FSP 115-1 amends FASB Statements No. 115,

Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, and
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18,

The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

.

FSP 115-1 replaces
the impairment evaluation guidance of EITF Issue No. 03-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments

(“EITF 03-1”), with references to
existing other-than-temporary impairment guidance. EITF 03-1’s disclosure
requirements remain in effect, and are applicable for year-end reporting and
for interim periods if there are significant changes from the previous year-end.
FSP 115-1 also supersedes EITF Topic No. D-44,

Recognition
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose
Cost Exceeds Fair Value

, and clarifies that an investor should
recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed
other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not
been made. FSP 115-1 applies to reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2005. FSP 115-1 did not have a material impact on our results of
operations or cash flows for the year ended ended December 31, 2006.

We adopted SFAS 123R
effective January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R is a new and complex accounting
standard, the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of
estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock
price volatility, expected option lives, and expected option forfeiture rates, to
value equity-based compensation. SFAS 123R requires the recognition of the fair
value of stock compensation in the statement of operations.

Sources and Uses of Cash.

Due
to our significant research and development expenditures, we have not been
profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in
1991 through 1996 and in 1999 through 2006. As such, we have funded our
research and development operations through sales of equity securities, the
issuance of convertible subordinated notes, cash received from customers, and
collaborative arrangements.  As of December 31,
2006, approximately $11.2 million of marketable securities were classified as
long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as they had been
in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and we had the
ability to hold them until the carrying value recovers, which may be longer
than one year. At December 31, 2006, we had available cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities of $329.8 million. Our cash and
marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest-bearing
instruments including obligations of U.S. government agencies, high-grade
corporate bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts.  Available cash is invested in accordance with
our investment policy’s primary objectives of liquidity, safety of principal
and diversity of investments.


Cash
Flows from Operating Activities.

Net cash used in operating
activities was $50.4 million, $101.9 million and $114.7 million for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $51.5 million
decrease from 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to the $40.0 million upfront fee
received from Pfizer in January 2006. The $12.8 million decrease from 2004
to 2005 was due primarily to a decrease of $21.4 million used to fund
restructuring expenses and $1.2 million decrease used to fund interest expense.
These items were partially offset by a $7.1 million reduction in cash received
from customer sales and an increase of $6.0 million used to fund research and
development and selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities.

Our investing
activities, other than purchases, sales and maturities of marketable
securities, have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and
purchases of long-term investments. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, were $1.6 million, $1.6 million and $1.4 million,
respectively. In the future, net cash used by investing activities may
fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic
equity investments, acquisitions, including possible earn-out payments to
former Maxia stockholders, capital expenditures and maturities/sales and
purchases of marketable securities.

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities.

Net cash
provided by financing activities was $31.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2006, while net cash used in financing activities was $34.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005, and net cash provided by financing
activities was $294.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. During
2006, we issued a total of $151.8 million of 3½%

Senior Notes, which resulted in proceeds of
approximately $111.9 million and redeemed $91.6 million of the 5.5% Notes.  In connection with the collaborative research
and license agreement, Pfizer purchased the $10.0 million Pfizer Note in February 2006.
During 2005, we paid $35.8 million in connection with repurchases of $36.5
million in face value of the 5.5% Notes, offset partially by $1.5 million of
proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock
purchase plan. During 2004, we issued a total of $250.0 million of 3½%

convertible subordinated
notes due 2011 (the “3½% Subordinated Notes”), which resulted in net proceeds
of approximately $242.5 million. In 2004, we also repurchased $38.4 million
face value of 5.5% Notes on the open market for $38.4 million. In November 2004,
we completed a public offering of 9 million shares of common stock, resulting
in net proceeds of $83.3 million after deducting the underwriting discounts,
commissions and offering expenses. Cash proceeds from the issuance of common
stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans in 2004 were
$6.8 million. We may seek to restructure some or all of our outstanding
convertible debt instruments in the future depending upon market and other
conditions.

The amounts and timing of payments related to vacated
facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations. We have
entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space with scheduled


payments to us of $2.1
million (less than 1 year), $4.1 million (years 1-3), $2.0 million (years
4-5), and $0.0 million (over 5 years); these scheduled payments are not
reflected in the above table.

The table above excludes certain commitments that are
contingent upon future events. The most significant of these contractual
commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations are summarized below.

Commitments related to Maxia are considered contingent
commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be
enforceable. In February 2003, we completed our acquisition of Maxia. Under
the merger agreement, former Maxia stockholders have the right to receive
certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of $14.0 million
upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in
the merger agreement. Twenty percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will
be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our
common stock such that an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million
in our common stock (based upon the then fair value) could potentially be paid
pursuant to the earn out milestones. The milestones are set to occur as Maxia
products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any
time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger. In any
event, no more than 13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to
former Maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement. None
of these milestones has been achieved as of December 31, 2006.

We have entered into and intend to continue to seek to
license additional rights relating to compounds or technologies in connection
with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may
be required to pay up-front fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of
future products.

We expect to use net cash in 2007 as we invest in our
drug discovery and development programs; make payments related to our
restructuring programs; and continue to seek access to technologies through
investments, research and development and new alliances, license agreements
and/or acquisitions.

We believe that our cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our
capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our cash requirements depend
on numerous factors, including our expenditures in connection with alliances,
license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary
products, technologies and businesses; expenditures in connection with
potential repayments of our 3½% Senior Notes, 3½% Subordinated Notes, and the
Pfizer Note; expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development
programs; expenditures in connection with litigation; competing technological
and market developments; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and
enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; our receipt of
any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter
into, including the agreement with Pfizer; and costs associated with the
integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions. Changes
in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating
expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our
capital resources. We expect that future revenues generated from information
products, including licensing of intellectual property, will continue to
decline as we focus on drug discovery and development programs, and in 2007,
will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us.

Off Balance Sheet
Arrangements

We have no material
off-balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed under
Contractual Obligations.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our investments in marketable securities, which are
composed primarily of investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. government agency
debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities, are subject to
default, changes in credit rating and changes in market value. These
investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value
if market interest rates increase.   As
of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
were $329.8 million. Due to the nature of these investments, if market interest
rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of December 31,
2006, the decline in fair value would not be material.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte
Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Incyte Corporation, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’
equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at item 15 (a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Incyte Corporation, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, Incyte Corporation changed its method of accounting for stock-based
compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004) on January 1, 2006.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Incyte
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization
and Business.

Incyte
Corporation (“Incyte,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a drug discovery and
development company focused on developing proprietary small molecule drugs to
treat serious unmet medical needs. We have a pipeline with programs in HIV,
diabetes, oncology and inflammation.

We were founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1991. Until
2001, we devoted substantially all of our resources to the development,
marketing and sales of information and genomic products. We began our drug
discovery and development activities in early 2002.

Principles
of Consolidation.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Incyte Corporation
and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company accounts,
transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications.

Certain amounts reported in
previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 financial
statement presentation.

Use
of Estimates.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign
Currency Translation.

The
financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States are measured
using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet
date, as appropriate. The resulting translation adjustments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a separate component of
stockholders’equity (deficit). Income and expense items are translated at
average monthly rates of exchange.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk.

Cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade receivables, and long-term
strategic investments are financial instruments which potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk. The estimated fair value of financial
instruments approximates the carrying value based on available market
information. We primarily invest our excess available funds in notes and bills
issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and corporate debt securities
and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and to
any one type of investment, other than securities issued or guaranteed by the
U.S. government. Our customers for our information products are primarily
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are typically located in the
United States and Europe. We have not experienced any significant credit losses
on cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities or trade receivables to date
and do not require collateral on receivables.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents.

Cash
and cash equivalents are held in U.S. banks or in custodial accounts with U.S.,
and U.K. banks. Cash equivalents are defined as all liquid investments with
maturity from date of purchase of 90 days or less that are readily convertible
into cash and have insignificant interest rate risk.

Marketable
Securities—Available-for-Sale.

All marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses,
net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity (deficit).
We classify marketable securities available to fund current operations as
current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Marketable securities are
classified as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets if (i) they


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

have been in an unrealized
loss position for longer than six months and (ii) we have the ability to
hold them until the carrying value is recovered and such holding period may be
longer than one year. The amortized cost of debt securities in this category is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses and
declines in value judged to be other than temporary for available-for-sale
securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense), net.” The cost
of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Accounts
Receivable.

Accounts
receivable as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively. We provide an
allowance for doubtful accounts based on experience and specifically identified
risks. Accounts receivable are carried at fair value and charged off against
the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is unlikely
and we cease collection efforts.

Property
and Equipment.

Property
and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets (generally three to five years). Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the
assets or lease term.

Certain laboratory and computer equipment used by us
could be subject to technological obsolescence in the event that significant
advancement is made in competing or developing equipment technologies. Management
continually reviews the estimated useful lives of technologically sensitive
equipment and believes that those estimates appropriately reflect the current
useful life of our assets. In the event that a currently unknown significantly
advanced technology became commercially available, we would re-evaluate the
value and estimated useful lives of our existing equipment, possibly having a
material impact on the financial statements.

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets.

Long-lived
assets, including certain identifiable intangible assets, to be held and used
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable such as
a significant industry downturn or a significant decline in our market value. Determination
of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of
impairment charges for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of
such assets. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell.

Long-Term
Investments.

We
have made equity and debt investments in a number of companies whose businesses
may be complementary to our business. Most of these investments were made in
connection with the establishment of a collaborative arrangement between us and
the investee company. Our long-term investments have historically consisted of
investments in both privately and publicly-held companies in which we have
owned less than 20% of the outstanding voting stock and have not had the
ability to exert significant influence over the investees. Accordingly, our
long-term investments in privately-held companies have been accounted for under
the cost method and our investments in publicly-held companies have been
accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Statement No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. Our investments
in publicly-held companies are classified as available-for-sale and are
adjusted to their fair value each period


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

based on their quoted
market price with any adjustments being recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity
(deficit).

We periodically
evaluate the carrying value of our ownership interests in privately-held cost
method investees by reviewing conditions that might indicate an other-than
temporary decline in fair value, including the following:

·

Financial
performance of the investee;

·

Achievement
of business plan objectives and milestones including the hiring of key
employees, obtaining key business partnerships, and progress related to
research and development activities;

·

Available
cash; and

·

Completion
of debt and equity financings.

If our review of these factors indicates that an
other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the investee has occurred, we
estimate the fair value of the investee. When the carrying value of our
investments is materially greater than our pro-rata share of the estimated fair
value of the investee, we record an impairment charge to reduce our carrying
value. Impairment charges are recorded in the period when the related
triggering condition becomes known to management. We use the best information
available in performing our periodic evaluations; however, the information
available may be limited. These evaluations involve significant management
judgment, and the actual amounts realized for a specific investment may differ
from the carrying value. For our available-for-sale investments in
publicly-held investees, we monitor all unrealized losses to determine whether
a decline in fair value below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Generally,
when fair value is materially less than carrying value for six consecutive
months, we consider the decline to be other-than-temporary. When we conclude
that a decline is other-than-temporary, we adjust the carrying value of our
long-term investments in publicly-held investees so that our carrying value per
share is equal to the quoted market price per share. Future adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could
result in additional impairment charges.

Derivative
Financial Instruments.

We
hold warrants to purchase equity securities of a publicly-held company. Warrants
that can be exercised and settled by delivery of net shares such that we pay no
cash upon exercise or that are held in public companies are deemed derivative
financial instruments. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value
are recognized on the consolidated statement of operations, “Gain (loss) on
certain derivative financial instruments” in the period of change. We determine
the fair value of our warrants through option pricing models using current
market price and volatility assumptions.

Intangible
and Other Assets.

Patent
application costs relating to ongoing drug discovery and development are
charged to expense as incurred. In
prior years, costs of patents, patent applications and patent defense
for gene and genomic patents were capitalized and amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives of approximately five years in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17,

Intangible Assets

(“APB 17”).

Income
Taxes.

Income
taxes are accounted for using SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
Deferred income taxes are provided at the currently enacted income tax rates
for the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of
assets and liabilities and carry-forward items. The effective tax rate and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management’s estimates of the
ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. In addition, valuation
allowances are established for deferred tax assets

where the amount of
expected future taxable income from operations does not support the realization
of the asset. We believe that the current assumptions and other considerations
used to estimate the current year effective and deferred tax positions are
appropriate. However, if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs
from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for
income taxes could have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Financing
Costs Related to Long-term Debt.

Costs
associated with obtaining long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the
term of the related debt using the effective interest method.

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share.

We follow the
provisions of SFAS No. 128,

Earnings
Per Share,

which requires us to present basic and diluted earnings
per share. Our basic and diluted losses per share are calculated by dividing
the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during all periods presented. Options to purchase stock and convertible
debt are included in diluted earnings per share calculations, unless the
effects are anti-dilutive.

Revenue
Recognition.

Revenues are recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured. We have entered into various types of agreements for access
to our information databases and use of our intellectual property. Revenues are
deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist.
We exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably assured
or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms
associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to
refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the customer’s
payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer.

Revenues from ongoing database agreements are
recognized evenly over the access period. Revenues from licenses to our intellectual
property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements. Royalty
revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties
by the licensee or other agreed upon terms. We estimate royalty revenues based
on previous period royalties received and information provided by the third
party licensee. We exercise judgment in determining whether the information
provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty
revenue recognition thereon.

Under agreements involving multiple products, services
and/or rights to use assets, the multiple elements are divided into separate
units of accounting when certain criteria are met, including whether the
delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. When
separate units of accounting exist, consideration is allocated among the
separate elements based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair
value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of
the individual elements by us


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

to other customers. If
such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement
does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time
that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until
all elements of the arrangement are delivered. When elements are specifically
tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific
performance obligation tied to the element is completed. When revenues for an
element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, they are
recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.

In connection with our collaborative research and
license agreement with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), we received an upfront
non-refundable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006. The $40.0 million
upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over two years, our estimated performance period under the
agreement. Pfizer also purchased a $10.0 million principal amount convertible
subordinated note (the “Pfizer Note”) for $10.0 million from us in February 2006.
As the Pfizer Note is non-interest bearing, it has been discounted to its net
present value. The difference between the cash received and the present value
of the Pfizer Note in the amount of $3.2 million represents additional
consideration from Pfizer under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional
consideration as deferred revenue and will recognize it over two years, our
estimated performance period under the agreement. We recognize contract
revenues in connection with research services provided to Pfizer as earned. Future
development and milestone payments will be recognized as earned.

Revenues received from agreements with customers in
which we have an equity interest were $0.0 million, $0.0 million and
$1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Revenues recognized from transactions in which there
was originally a concurrent commitment to purchase goods or services from the
other party to the transaction for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 were $0.0 million, $0.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. No new
transactions in which there was a concurrent commitment by us to purchase goods
or services from the other party to the transaction were entered into during
the year ended December 31, 2006. Of commitments made in prior periods, we
expensed $0.0 million, $0.0 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

The above transactions were recorded at fair value in
accordance with our revenue and expense recognition policies.

Research
and Development.

Research
and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred
in performing research and development activities: salaries and related
benefits, collaboration and outside services, and occupancy and all other costs.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 (“FAS
2”),

Accounting for Research and Development
Costs

, it is our policy to expense research and development costs as
incurred. We often contract with Clinical Research Organizations (“CROs”) to facilitate,
coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug. To
ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred, we record
monthly accruals for clinical trial and preclinical testing costs based on the
work performed under the contract.

These CRO contracts typically call for payment of fees
for services at the initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of
certain clinical trial milestones. In the event that we prepay CRO fees for
future milestones, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the
asset into research and development expense over the period of time the
contracted research and development services are


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

performed. Most
professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management,
monitoring, and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract
period. These professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of
completion at a particular date.

Our CRO contracts generally include pass through fees.
Pass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses,
investigator fees, travel costs, and other miscellaneous costs including
shipping and printing fees. Because these fees are incurred at various times
during the contract term and they are used throughout the contract term, we
record a monthly expense allocation to recognize the fees during the contract
period. Fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the
setup period.

Other
Expenses.

We
recognize other expenses in connection with our plans to exit certain
activities. In connection with our exit activities, we record other expenses
for employee termination benefit costs, long-lived asset impairments, costs
related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased, and other
exit-related costs. These charges were incurred pursuant to formal plans
developed by management and accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities

, (“SFAS 146”), EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

(“EITF 94-3”) and EITF Issue No. 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination

(“EITF 95-3”). Fixed assets that are
written off or impaired as a result of restructuring plans are typically held
for sale or scrapped. The remaining carrying value of such assets was not
material as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The recognition of other
expenses requires our management to make judgments and estimates regarding the
nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity,
including estimating sublease income and the fair value, less sales costs, of
equipment to be disposed of. Management’s estimates of future liabilities may
change, requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the
amount of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we
evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that they are adequate, that
no excess accruals are retained, and that the utilization of the provisions are
for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans.

Stock-Based
Compensation.

Effective
January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004) (“SFAS 123R”),

Share-Based
Payment

, which revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
123 (“SFAS 123”),

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payment
transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on
their relative fair values. SFAS 123R is a new and complex accounting standard,
the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of
estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock
price volatility and expected option lives, as well as expected option
forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation. SFAS 123R requires the
recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of
operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation
expense related to employee stock options was not recognized in the statement
of operations. Prior to January 1, 2006, we had adopted the
disclosure-only provisions under SFAS 123. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R,
we recorded $8.9 million of stock compensation expense on our audited condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.
As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, our net loss for the year ended December 31,
2006, is $8.9 million higher than if we had continued to account for
share-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

Basic and diluted net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2006
are $0.11 higher than if we had continued to account for share-based

compensation under APB
Opinion No. 25

.

For the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 we recorded stock compensation
expense of $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively on our audited condensed
consolidated statement of operations related to restricted shares issued to our
Chief Executive Officer.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

, (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2005, the FASB issued staff position
FAS 115-1,

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments

(“FSP 115-1”). FSP 115-1 address the determination as to when an investment is
considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary and the
measurement of an impairment loss. FSP 115-1 also includes accounting
considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have
not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP 115-1
amends FASB Statements No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

,
and Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock

.

FSP 115-1 replaces the impairment evaluation guidance
of EITF Issue No. 03-1,

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

(“EITF 03-1”), with references to existing other-than-temporary impairment
guidance. EITF 03-1’s disclosure requirements remain in effect, and are
applicable for year-end reporting and for interim periods if there are
significant changes from the previous year-end. FSP 115-1 also supersedes EITF
Topic No. D-44,

Recognition of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost
Exceeds Fair Value

, and clarifies that an investor should recognize
an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed
other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not
been made. FSP 115-1 applies to reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2005. FSP 115-1 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, or
cash flows for the year ended ended December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, approximately $11.2 million
of marketable securities were classified as long-term assets on the
consolidated balance sheet as they have been in an unrealized loss position for
longer than six months and we have the ability to hold them until the carrying
value recovers, which may be longer than one year. As of December 31, 2005
all of our marketable securities were classified as short-term because they
were available-for-sale and may not be held until maturity as we had not yet
adopted FAS 115-1,

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments

(“FSP 115-1”).

Net realized gains
(losses) of $6.1 million, $1.3 million and $(0.7) million from sales of
marketable securities were included in “Interest and other income/ (expense),
net” in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Note 3.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

As of December 31, 2006, we previously had
entered into agreements for information products and services, which include
licensing a portion of our intellectual property, with pharmaceutical,
biotechnology and agricultural companies and academic institutions.   Such agreements represented 100% of license
and royalty revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004. In general, customers agree to
pay, during the term of the agreement, fees to receive non-exclusive access to
selected modules of our databases and/or licenses of certain of our
intellectual property. In addition, if a customer develops certain products
utilizing our technology or proprietary information, we could potentially
receive royalty and milestone payments. In November 2005, we entered into
a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer, which became
effective in January 2006.

A single customer contributed 88%, 21% and 11% of
total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Three customers comprised
78% and 67% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

Note 4.   Collaborative
License Agreement

Effective in January 2006, we entered a
collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the pursuit of our
CCR2 antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and
commercialization


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

rights to our portfolio of
CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer’s rights extend to the full scope of
potential indications, with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune
nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We
do not have obligations to Pfizer on pre-clinical development candidates we
select for pursuit in these indications.

We received an upfront nonrefundable payment of $40.0
million in January 2006 and are eligible to receive additional future
development and milestone payments of up to $743.0 million for the successful
development and commercialization of CCR2 antagonists in multiple indications,
as well as royalties on worldwide sales. The $40.0 million upfront fee was
recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized on a straight-line basis
over two years, our estimated performance period under the agreement. Contract
revenues related thereto of approximately $20.3 million were recognized for the
year ended December 31, 2006. Future development and milestone payments
will be recognized as earned.

We also recognized
contract revenues of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 in connection with research services provided to Pfizer. We recognize
contract revenues in connection with research services provided to Pfizer as
earned. At December 31, 2006 approximately $0.7 million was receivable
from Pfizer for reimbursement of expenses incurred by us pursuant to the
agreement.

Note 6.   Long-Term
Investments

The activity in our long-term investments, in any
given quarter, may result in gains or losses on sales or impairment charges. Amounts
realized upon disposition of these investments may be different from their
carrying value.

In June 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of
$1.3 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in a privately-held
investee because the investee had less than six months of cash and we believed
that the likelihood of obtaining future debt or equity financing that would not
result in an impairment was remote.


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In March 2006, we sold a portion of our
investment in a publicly-held company accounted for under FASB Statement
No.115,

Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities

, for $11.5 million, and in October 2006,
we sold the remaining portion of this investment for $5.8 million, which
resulted in a aggregate realized gain of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.

In May 2005, we sold our investment in the
publicly-held company accounted for under FASB Statement No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

, for $5.7 million, resulting in a realized gain of $2.8
million.

As of December 31, 2004 we had a put right
commitment to purchase up to $5.0 million of equity in an investee at any time
on or after January 1, 2005, provided certain conditions were met. On October 4,
2005, these conditions were met and our investee exercised its right under
which we were required to acquire $5.0 million of common stock. This investment
has been accounted for as a short term investment under FASB Statement No.115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.

In 2004, we recorded impairment charges of $5.2
million to reduce the carrying value of our investments in three privately-held
investees by $2.5 million, $1.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, because
the investees had less than six months of cash and the likelihood of future
debt or equity financing by the investees was remote.

The activity in our
long-term investments, in any given quarter, may result in gains or losses on
sales or impairment charges. Amounts realized upon disposition of these
investments may be different from their carrying value.

Amortization expense for the years ended December 31,

and $5.0 million, respectively. The expected future annual amortization expense
of our gene and genomics-related patent costs is $0.3 million per year through
2008.

In connection with our review of the recoverability of
our long-lived assets during the second quarter of 2004, we revised the estimated
useful life of our capitalized gene and genomics-related patent costs from ten
to five years based on the increasingly competitive and challenging legal and
economic environment for gene and genomics-related intellectual property. This
change in accounting estimate increased our net loss by $2.5 million and our
basic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operations by $0.03 in
2004. In December 2004, based on declining estimated future cash flows
associated with our gene and genomics-related intellectual property, we
recorded a charge of $12.1 million to adjust the carrying value of


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

previously capitalized
costs associated with the preparation, prosecution and maintenance of our gene
patent portfolio to its estimated fair market value.

In March 2002, in connection with his employment
by Incyte as Executive Vice President and Chief Drug Discovery Scientist, Brian
W. Metcalf received an interest-free loan from us in the amount of $400,000 to
be used for financing his residence in California. The loan was evidenced by a
promissory note and secured by the residence. On February 6, 2003, 25% of
the outstanding principal balance was forgiven, and 1/48 of the principal
amount was forgiven on the last day of each month thereafter, with the
remaining outstanding principal balance of the loan forgiven on February 6,
2006. We amortized this loan to compensation expense on a straight-line basis
over the forgiveness period.

In December 2004, we assigned one of our existing
facility operating leases to a third party. Under the terms of the consent
agreement with the facility’s landlord, we were required to obtain a letter of
credit in favor of the landlord in the amount of $2.6 million. The deposit and
the related amount required under the letter of credit declines monthly on a
pro-rata basis through March 2011, the remaining term of the lease
agreement assigned. The deposit is included in other assets at December 31,
2006.

In September 2006, we received proceeds of $111.9
million from the sale of $151.8 million aggregate principal amount of the
3½% convertible senior notes due 2011 (the “3½% Senior Notes”).  The 3½% Senior Notes bear interest at the
rate of 3.5% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15,
and are due February 15, 2011. The 3½% Senior Notes are convertible
into shares of Incyte common stock at an initial conversion rate of 89.1385
shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 3½% Senior Notes, equivalent to
an initial conversion price of approximately $11.22 per share.  The 3½% Senior Notes are senior in right
of payment to Incyte’s outstanding 3½% convertible subordinated notes due 2011
(the “3½% Subordinated Notes”) and the Pfizer Note. We may redeem the
3½% Senior Notes beginning on February 20, 2007. The 3½% Senior
Notes were issued at a discount to par of approximately $39.9 million. The
carrying value of the 3½% Senior Notes is $114.0 million at

December 31, 2006. The
3½% Senior Notes will accrete up to their face value over the 53 month term of
the notes by recording interest expense under the effective interest method.

In connection with the collaborative research and
license agreement, Pfizer purchased  the
$10.0 million principal amount Pfizer Note in February 2006. At our
option, prior to September 28, 2007, once we are able to initiate

Phase I clinical trials of a CCR2
antagonist in a retained Incyte indication, Pfizer may purchase from us an
additional $10.0 million convertible subordinated note. The Pfizer Note
purchased in February 2006 bears no interest, is due seven years from the
date of issuance and is convertible into our common stock at an initial
conversion price of $6.8423 per share, subject to adjustments. The Pfizer Note
is subordinated to all senior indebtedness, including the 3½% Senior Notes, and
pari passu in right of payment with our 3½% Subordinated Notes. We may, at our
option, repay the Pfizer Note beginning February 3, 2009. Pfizer may
require us to repay the Pfizer Note upon a change of control, as defined. As
the Pfizer Note is non interest bearing, it has been discounted to its net
present value of $6.8 million by imputing interest at a rate of 4.5%, which
represented market conditions in place at the time the note was issued. The
carrying value of the Pfizer Note was $7.1 million at December 31, 2006. We
will accrete the Pfizer Note up to its face value over its term of seven years
by recording interest expense under the effective interest method. The
difference between the cash received and the present value of the Pfizer Note,
which equals the face value less the non interest bearing portion and
beneficial conversion feature, represents additional consideration from Pfizer
under the agreement. We have accounted for this additional consideration as
deferred revenue and will recognize it over two years, our estimated
performance period under the agreement. Contract revenues related thereto of
approximately $1.5 million were recognized for the year ended December 31,
2006.

In February and March 2004, in a private
placement, we issued a total of $250.0 million of  the 3


¤


% Subordinated
Notes, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $242.5 million. The
notes bear interest at the rate of 3.5% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15
and August 15. The notes are subordinated to all senior indebtedness,
including the 3½% Senior Notes, and pari passu in right of payment with the
Pfizer Note. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an
initial conversion price of approximately $11.22 per share, subject to adjustments.
Holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change in control, as
defined. We may redeem the notes beginning February 20, 2007.

In February 2000, in
a private placement, we issued $200.0 million of 5.5% convertible subordinated
notes due February 1, 2007 (the “5.5% Notes”), which resulted in net
proceeds of approximately $196.8 million. The notes bore interest at 5.5%,
payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and were
subordinated to all senior indebtedness, as defined. The notes could be
converted at the option of the holder at an initial conversion price of $67.42
per share, subject to adjustment. We repurchased on the open market, and
retired, $36.5 million and $38.4 million in face value of 5.5% Notes during the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gains (losses) of
$0.5 million and $(0.2) million on these transactions were recognized for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. All gains or losses
on repurchase are presented as “Gain (loss) on redemption/repurchase of
convertible subordinated notes” in our statements of operations. In October 2006,
all of the remaining outstanding 5.5% Notes were redeemed for 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, which
resulted in a $0.1 million charge in the three months ended December 31,
2006 as a result of the write-off of the remaining deferred financing costs
related to the 5.5% Notes.

In February 2004, we announced a restructuring
plan to close our information products research facility and headquarters in
Palo Alto, California and move our headquarters to our Wilmington, Delaware
pharmaceutical research and development facility. The closure of the Palo Alto
facility corresponded with terminating further development activities around
our Palo Alto-based information products line. The restructuring plan included
the elimination of 183 employees and charges related to the closure of our Palo
Alto facilities, previously capitalized tenant improvements and equipment and
other items. The lease commitment and related costs originally included the
present value of future lease obligations for two facilities. In the fourth
quarter of 2004, we made a lease termination payment to satisfy our remaining
lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities. The lease obligation
for the second facility extends through March 2011. As a result of the
long term nature of the remaining lease obligation, we will be recording a
charge each period through the March 2011 termination date of the lease
related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations in accordance
with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,

which total approximately $1.4 million at December 31, 2006.

In December 2004,
based on declining estimated future cash flows associated with our gene and
genomics-related intellectual property, we recorded expense of $12.1 million to
adjust the carrying value of previously capitalized costs associated with the
preparation, prosecution and maintenance of our gene patent portfolio to its
estimated fair market value.

2003 Restructuring and Other Impairments

As a result of a decision
made in the fourth quarter of 2003 to restructure our information product line
in connection with the discontinuation of our clone activities and support
functions, we recognized other expenses of $11.5 million. The plan included
elimination of certain employees and write-down of


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

certain
assets related to our genomic information product line. We recorded charges of
approximately $5.0 million related to the severance and benefits of
approximately 75 employees, who worked at our Palo Alto, California location. We
also recorded a charge of $1.9 million related to the write-off of excess
equipment and other assets associated with the activities being exited. The
write-down of equipment and other assets relates primarily to computer
equipment and related software, lab equipment and office equipment. As of January 2,
2004, all of these employees had been terminated under this restructuring
program and the plan was completed in the second quarter of 2004. There were no
additional restructuring charges recorded for this program for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005.

In November 2002, we announced plans to reduce
our expenditures, primarily in research and development, through a combination
of spending reductions, workforce reductions, and office consolidations. The
plan included elimination of approximately 37% of our approximately 700-person
workforce from our offices in Palo Alto, California; Beverly, Massachusetts;
and Cambridge, England and the consolidation of our office and research
facilities in Palo Alto, California. As a result, we recorded an expense of
$33.9 million related to restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of
2002.

We currently have one
remaining lease related to an exited site that is due to expire in December 2010.
During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized
additional charges of $(1.5) million, $0.1 million and $1.6 million,
respectively, primarily relating to this facility for lease expenses in excess
or less than of amounts originally estimated. We estimated the costs based on
the contractual terms of agreements and current real estate market conditions. We
may incur additional costs associated with these subleasing and lease
termination activities.

2001 Restructuring and Other Impairments

In October 2001, we
announced a restructuring of our operations in order to focus on our database
licensing and partnership programs and our drug discovery and development
programs. As a result, we recorded an expense of $55.6 million related to
restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2001. In 2004, the remaining
facility operating leases expired and all restructuring related activities were
completed. There were no additional restructuring or impairment charges
recorded for this program for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

In accordance with EITF 95-3,
we recorded a $2.9 million charge in 2003 related to restructuring costs for
Maxia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which consisted of workforce reductions and
consolidation of facilities. We recorded employee termination costs of
approximately $0.8 million for 28 employee positions. The job eliminations were
completed in July 2003. We also recorded restructuring costs related to
lease payments for property that has been vacated and other costs of $2.0
million. In 2006, 2005 and 2004 we recorded additional charges of ($0.1)
million, $0.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, relating to facilities
lease expenses in excess of amounts originally estimated. The operating lease
related to the vacated facility expires in November 2008.

Note 10.   Stockholders’
Deficit

Preferred
Stock.

We
are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which was
outstanding as of December 31, 2006 or 2005. The Board of Directors may
determine the rights, preferences and privileges of any preferred stock issued
in the future. We have reserved 250,000 shares of preferred stock designated as
Series A Participating Preferred Stock for issuance in connection with the
Stockholders Rights plan described below.

Common
Stock.

As
of December 31, 2006, we had reserved a total of 14,860,801 shares of our
common stock for future issuance related to our stock plans as described below.

On November 5, 2004, we completed a public
offering of 9 million shares of our authorized but unissued common stock at
$9.75 per share pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement,
resulting in net proceeds of $83.3 million after deducting the underwriting
discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

In May 2006, our stockholders approved an
increase in the number of shares available for grant under the 1997 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) from 3,100,000 shares to 3,850,000 shares.

Stock
Compensation Plans.

Summaries
of stock option activity for our stock option plans as of December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, and related information for the years ended December 31
are included in the plan descriptions below.

Stock Plan.

In
November 1991, the Board of Directors adopted the 1991 Stock Plan (the “Stock
Plan”), which was amended and restated for issuance of common stock to
employees, consultants, and scientific advisors. Options issued under the plan
shall, at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors, be either incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options or
restricted stock units. The exercise prices of incentive and non-statutory
stock options granted under the plan are not less than the fair market value on
the date of the grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. Options
generally vest over four years, pursuant to a formula determined by our Board
of Directors, and expire after ten years. Certain options granted in 2002 vest
pro rata monthly over three years and expire after ten years. In June 2002,
our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan from 19,900,000 to 22,350,000.

During 2001, we granted 490,000 restricted stock units
under the Stock Plan to certain management personnel. In connection with the
grant of these restricted stock units, we recorded deferred compensation of
$7.9 million in 2001. These restricted stock units had cliff vesting terms
over one to four years and were being amortized to stock compensation expense
over those vesting terms. Stock compensation expense of $0.5 million and $0.2
million was recorded in 2004 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31,
2005, all of the restricted stock units had vested or had been previously
forfeited.

Non-Employee
Directors’ Stock Option Plan.

In August 1993, the Board of
Directors approved the 1993 Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the “Directors’ Plan”),
which was later amended. The Directors’ Plan provides for the automatic grant
of options to purchase shares of common stock to our non-employee directors. In
June 2005, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares
of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan from 1,100,000 to
1,500,000.

Under the Directors’ Plan, each new non-employee
director joining the Board will receive an option to purchase 35,000 shares of
common stock. Additionally, members who continue to serve on the Board will
receive annual option grants for 20,000 shares exercisable in full on the first
anniversary of the date of the grant. All options are exercisable at the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant.

stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares available for grant
from 3,100,000 shares to 3,850,000 shares. Each regular full-time and part-time
employee working 20 hours or more per week is eligible to participate after one
month of employment. We issued 313,715, 389,801 and 448,861 shares under the
ESPP in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
2006 we recorded stock compensation expense of $0.4 million under SFAS 123R as
the ESPP is considered compensatory under SFAS 123R. As of December 31,
2006, 976,173 shares remain available for issuance under the ESPP.

Stockholders Rights Plan.

On September 25, 1998, the
Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the “Rights Plan”), pursuant
to which one preferred stock purchase right (a “Right”) was distributed for
each outstanding share of common stock held of record on October 13, 1998.
One Right will also attach to each share of common stock issued by the Company
subsequent to such date and prior to the distribution date defined below. Each
Right represents a right to purchase, under certain circumstances, a fractional
share of our Series A Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price
of $100.00, subject to adjustment. In general, the Rights will become
exercisable and trade independently from the common stock on a distribution
date that will occur on the earlier of (i) the public announcement of the
acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more of the common stock or (ii) ten
days after commencement of a tender or exchange offer for the common stock that
would result in the acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock. Upon the
occurrence of certain other events related to changes in ownership of the
common stock, each holder of a Right would be entitled to purchase shares of
common stock, or an acquiring corporation’s common stock, having a market value
of twice the exercise price. Under certain conditions, the Rights may be
redeemed at $0.01 per Right by the Board of Directors. The Rights expire on September 25,
2008.

11.   Stock
compensation

We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. SFAS
123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net
income. We recognize the stock compensation expense over the requisite service
period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period. Prior
to January 1, 2006, we followed APB Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and related
interpretations in accounting for our stock compensation.

We elected the modified prospective method in adopting
SFAS 123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to all awards
granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized
expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is recognized in net
income in the periods after the date of adoption using the same valuation
method (Black-Scholes) and assumptions determined under the original provisions
of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,

as disclosed in our previous filings.

Under
the provisions of SFAS 123R, we recorded $8.9 million of stock compensation
expense on our audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2006. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, our net loss for the year ended December 31,
2006 is $8.9 million higher than if we had continued to account for share-based
compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the
years ended December 31, 2006 are $0.11 higher than if we had continued to
account for share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. For the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 we recorded stock compensation expense of $0.2 million and $0.5
million, respectively on our audited consolidated statement of operations
related to restricted shares issued to our Chief Executive Officer.  We utilized the Black-Scholes valuation model
for estimating the fair value of the stock compensation granted, with the
following weighted-average assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S.
Federal Reserve rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected life
calculation is based on the observed and expected time to the exercise of
options by our employees based on historical exercise patterns for similar type
options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our
common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options.
 A dividend yield of zero is assumed
based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present
intention to pay cash dividends.

Based on our historical experience, we have assumed an
annualized forfeiture rate of 5% for our options. Under the true-up provisions
of SFAS 123R, we will record additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate
is lower than we estimated, and will record a recovery of prior expense if the
actual forfeiture is higher than we estimated.

respectively.


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Approximately
$61.5 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to
benefits from stock option deductions which, when recognized, will be allocated
directly to contributed capital.

Management believes the uncertainty
regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets requires a valuation
allowance.

As of December 31,
2006, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $755.0 million. We also had federal and state research and development
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $35.0 million. The net operating loss
carryforwards and tax credits will expire at various dates, beginning in 2006
through 2024, if not utilized. Utilization of the net operating losses and
credits may be subject to an annual limitation, due to the “change in ownership”
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. We
also had federal and state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $27.5
million that will expire beginning in 2009.

Note 13.   Net
Loss Per Share

For
all periods presented, both basic and diluted net loss per common share are
computed by dividing the net loss by the number of weighted average common
shares outstanding during the period. Stock options and potential common shares
issuable upon conversion of our 3½% Senior Notes, 3½% Subordinated Notes and
5.5% Notes were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as
their share effect was anti-dilutive for all periods presented. The potential

accordance with FASB Statement No. 131 (“SFAS 131”). For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2006, we recorded revenue from customers throughout the
United States and in Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Export
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $0.6
million, $2.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively.

Note 15.   Defined Contribution Plan

We have a defined
contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code covering all domestic employees. Employees may contribute a
portion of their compensation, which is then matched by us, subject to certain
limitations. Defined contribution expense was $0.0 million, $0.5 million and
$0.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Note 16.

Discontinued
Operations

In December 2004, we
also entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related
to our Proteome facility based in Beverly, Massachusetts (“Proteome”), which
transaction subsequently closed in January 2005. The consolidated
statements of operations and consolidated cash flows have been restated to
present Proteome as a discontinued operation for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004.

Note 17.   Litigation

Invitrogen

In October 2001,
Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”) filed an action against us in the federal
court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of three patents. On June 15,
2006 we entered into a settlement agreement with Invitrogen pursuant to which
we agreed to pay Invitrogen $3.4 million as a settlement fee. This amount was
paid on June 20, 2006 and is included in other expenses in the
accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2006.

In addition to the matter
described above, from time to time we have been involved in certain legal
actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management’s opinion,
the outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Note 18.   Related Party Transactions

The following summarizes
our related party transactions as defined by FASB Statement No. 57,

Related Party Disclosures

(“SFAS 57”). In
each of the transactions noted in which a director of Incyte was at the time of
the transaction in some way affiliated with the other party to the transaction,
such director recused himself from voting on the related party transaction,
other than the Senomyx, Inc. transaction.

During 1997, we purchased
diaDexus Series B Preferred Stock at a cost of $1.3 million. We do not
have the ability to exert significant influence over diaDexus. We have an
executive officer who sits on diaDexus’ Board of Directors. In June 2006,
we recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million to reduce the carrying value
of this investment because the investee had less than six months of cash and
the likelihood of future debt or equity financing that would not result in an
impairment was remote.

During 2000 and 2001 we
purchased shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock of Genomic Health, Inc. (“Genomic Health”) for an aggregate purchase
price of $6.0 million. In connection with the completion of its initial public
offering on October 4, 2005, these shares were converted into common
shares. Additionally as part of its initial public offering, Genomic Health
exercised an election under which we were required to acquire an additional
$5.0 million of Genomic Health common stock. In March 2006, we sold our
initial investment for $11.5 million, and in October 2006, we sold the
remaining portion of this investment for $5.8 million, which resulted in a
aggregate realized gain of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. Julian C. Baker, one of our directors, is also a director of Genomic
Health and holds shares, directly or beneficially, of both companies.


INCYTE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

During 2000, we purchased
shares of Series D Preferred Stock of Senomyx, Inc. (“Senomyx”) for
an aggregate purchase price of $6.5 million. In connection with the completion
of Senomyx’s initial public offering in 2004, our ownership interest was
converted into common shares. These shares were sold in 2005 for $5.7 million,
resulting in a realized gain of $2.8 million from their carrying value. Frederick
B. Craves, one of our former directors, is a partner of Bay City Capital, which
held shares of Senomyx stock.

During 2005, we
repurchased on the open market, and retired, $36.5 million in face value of
5.5% Notes. One such transaction in 2005 involved the repurchase, at a purchase
price of 98.25% of face value, of $5.0 million in face value of such notes from
a limited partnership of which Julian C. Baker, one of our directors, is a
controlling member of the general partner of the general partner and may have a
pecuniary interest. Mr. Baker did not participate in our decision to
engage in such a repurchase transaction. The price paid by us in such
repurchase transaction was equal to the price paid by us to an independent
third party in a comparable transaction negotiated on an arms’-length basis a
short time prior to such repurchase transaction.

Note 19.

Commitments

As of December 31,
2006, we had noncancelable operating leases on multiple facilities and
equipment, including facilities in Palo Alto, California; San Diego,
California; and Wilmington, Delaware. The leases expire on various dates
ranging from June 2007 to March 2011. Certain leases have renewal options
for periods ranging up to 5 years. Rent expense, excluding rent expense
recognized in the restructuring charges in 2004, for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, was approximately $4.4 million, $4.2 million and $6.7
million, respectively.

As of December 31,
2006, future noncancelable minimum payments under operating leases, including
leases for sites included in the restructuring programs were as follows:

million (years 1-3), $2.0 million (years 4-5), and $0.0 million
(over 5 years).

In addition to the
non-cancelable commitments included in the table above, we have entered into
contractual arrangements that obligate us to make payments to the contractual
counterparties upon the occurrence of future events. We consider these
potential obligations contingent, and have summarized all significant
arrangements below.

Commitments related to
Maxia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Maxia”) are considered contingent
commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable.

February 2003,
we completed our acquisition of Maxia. Under the merger agreement, former Maxia
stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a
potential aggregate amount of $14.0 million upon the occurrence of certain
research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement. Twenty
percent of each earn out payment, if earned, will be paid in cash and the
remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that
an aggregate of $2.8 million in cash and $11.2 million in our common stock
(based upon the then fair value) could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn
out milestones. The milestones occur as Maxia products enter various stages of
human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth
anniversary of the consummation of the merger. In any event, no more than
13,531,138 shares of our common stock may be issued to former Maxia
stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement. None of these
milestones had been achieved as of December 31, 2006.

We have entered into and
intend to continue to seek to license additional rights relating to compounds
or technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs.
Under these licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees, milestone
payments and royalties on sales of future products.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and

Not applicable.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

We maintain “disclosure controls and
procedures,” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable
assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The
design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions.

Based on their evaluation
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Management’s annual report on internal control over
financial reporting.

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2006. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included herein.


REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incyte
Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Incyte Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Incyte
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Incyte
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Incyte Corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on the COSO criteria

.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Incyte Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity
(deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006 of Incyte Corporation and our report dated February 22, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
