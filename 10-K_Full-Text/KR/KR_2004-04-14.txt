PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. As of January 31, 2004, the Company was one of the largest grocery retailers in the United
States based on annual sales. The Company also manufactures and processes food for sale in its supermarkets. The Company employs approximately 290,000 full and part-time employees. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 1014
Vine Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 and its telephone number is (513) 762-4000. The Company maintains a web site (www.Kroger.com) which includes additional information about the Company. The Company makes available through its web site, free of
charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its current reports on Form 8-K, including amendments thereto. These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company’s file them
electronically with the SEC.

The Company’s revenues are
earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in its supermarkets. The Company earns income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of its costs to make these products available to
its customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses.

S

TORES

As of January 31, 2004, the Company operated, either directly or through our subsidiaries, 2,532 supermarkets. Approximately 30% of these supermarkets
operated in company-owned facilities. As of January 31, 2004, 466 of these supermarkets had fuel centers. The Company’s current growth strategy emphasizes self-development and ownership of store real estate. The Company’s stores operate
under several banners that have strong local ties and brand equity. Supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats: combination food and drug stores (“combo stores”); multi-department stores; or price impact
warehouse stores.

The combo stores are the primary food store
format. They are typically able to earn a return above the Company’s cost of capital by drawing customers from a 2 – 2 ½ mile radius. The Company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the
specialty departments that customers desire for one-stop shopping, including “whole health” sections, pharmacies, general merchandise, pet centers and high quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce. Many combination
stores include a fuel center.

Multi-department stores are
significantly larger in size than combo stores. In addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store, multi-department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel, home fashion and furnishings, electronics,
automotive, toys and fine jewelry. Many multi-department stores include a fuel center.

Price impact warehouse stores offer a “no-frills, low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items. Quality meat,
dairy, baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage. The average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store.

In addition to supermarkets, the Company operates, either directly or through subsidiaries, 802 convenience stores and 440
fine jewelry stores. Subsidiaries operated 707 of the convenience stores, while 95 were operated through franchise agreements. Approximately 43% of the convenience stores operated by subsidiaries were operated in company-owned facilities. The
convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and, in most cases, sell gasoline.

M

ERCHANDISING

AND

M

ANUFACTURING

Corporate brand products play an important role in the Company’s merchandising strategy. Supermarket divisions
typically stock approximately 7,800 private label items. The Company’s corporate brand products are produced and sold in three quality “tiers.” Private Selection is the premium quality brand designed to meet or beat the
“gourmet” or “upscale” national or regional brands. The “banner brand” (Kroger, Ralphs, King Soopers, etc.), which represents the majority of the Company’s private label items, is designed to be equal to or better
than the national brand and carries the “Try It, Like It, or Get the National Brand Free” guarantee. FMV (For Maximum Value) is the value brand, designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price.

Approximately 55% of the corporate brand units sold are produced in the Company’s manufacturing
plants; the remaining corporate brand items are produced to the Company’s strict specifications by outside manufacturers. The Company performs a “make or buy” analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a
comparison of market-based transfer prices versus open market purchases. As of January 31, 2004, the Company operated 42 manufacturing plants. These plants consisted of 18 dairies, 11 deli or bakery plants, five grocery product plants, three
beverage plants, three meat plants and two cheese plants.

S

EGMENTS

The Company operates
retail food and drug stores, multi-department stores, jewelry stores, and convenience stores in the Midwest, South and West. The Company’s retail operations, which represent approximately 99% of consolidated sales, are its only reportable
segment. All of the Company’s operations are domestic.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

As of January 31, 2004, the Company operated more than 3,300 owned or leased supermarkets, convenience stores, distribution warehouses, and food
processing facilities through divisions, marketing areas, subsidiaries or affiliates. These facilities are located principally in the Southern, Midwestern, and Western portions of the United States. A majority of the properties used to conduct the
Company’s business are leased.

The Company generally owns
store equipment, fixtures and leasehold improvements, as well as processing and manufacturing equipment. The total cost of the Company’s owned assets and capitalized leases at January 31, 2004 was $18,425 million while the accumulated
depreciation was $7,247 million.

Leased premises generally
have base terms ranging from ten to twenty years with renewal options for additional periods. Some options provide the right to purchase the property after conclusion of the lease term. Store rentals are normally payable monthly at a stated amount
or at a guaranteed minimum amount plus a percentage of sales over a stated dollar volume. Rentals for the distribution, processing and miscellaneous facilities generally are payable monthly at stated amounts. For additional information on leased
premises, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As previously disclosed, on March 5, 2001, the Company announced that it would restate earnings by minor amounts for fiscal 1998, fiscal 1999 and the
first two quarters of fiscal 2000. Following this announcement, two shareholders filed lawsuits, purporting to be class actions, against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer in the United States District Court, for the Southern District of
Ohio, Western Division, which were consolidated as Case No. 1:01-CV-265. The court dismissed the suit and the appeal period has run without an appeal having been filed. Furthermore, the Company has been notified by the staff of the SEC that its
inquiry relating to the restatement has been terminated and no enforcement action has been recommended to the SEC against the Company.

There are pending against the Company various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business, including suits charging violations of certain
antitrust and civil rights laws. Some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. Any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled. Although it is not possible
at this time to evaluate the merits of these claims and lawsuits, nor their likelihood of success, the Company is of the opinion that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

PERATING

E

NVIRONMENT

Traditional grocery retailers, including Kroger, have experienced significant business challenges in recent years. Consumers
have remained cautious in their purchases amid concerns about the economy and high unemployment while competition has continued to intensify. Customers today have a larger number of stores and greater variety of retail formats from which to select.
These factors have placed pressure on retail prices. Additionally, our company, as well as several of our traditional competitors, has faced dramatic increases in certain operating costs, particularly labor and employee benefit costs in unionized
markets.

Our management team identified these trends more than
two years ago and implemented strategic initiatives designed to control costs and offer better value to our customers. We have made progress since that time. We believe future industry consolidation is likely and presents opportunities for Kroger to
gain market share and improve financial results as weaker competitors decline in or exit markets and their sales base is picked up by their competitors.

Kroger has a high-quality asset base that holds the #1 or #2 market share in 43 of our 52 major markets with leading market share in many of the
nation’s largest and fastest-growing markets. We define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores. According to our internal share estimates, Kroger’s share increased in 28 of our 52 major markets in 2003. On a
volume-weighted basis, Kroger’s market share was unchanged.

We are in a stronger financial and cash flow position than are many in our industry and, even at current earnings, we continue to earn more than our cost of capital, excluding the effect of labor disputes and the goodwill and asset
impairment charges.

Our plan, going forward, is to continue
sharpening our focus on price and to make further reductions in operating costs. We expect those reductions will fund a portion of our price investments. Our focus on operating costs will include those items traditionally recorded as operating,
general and administrative (“OG&A”) expenses plus certain items included in merchandise costs. This focus includes shrink, warehousing and transportation costs, and advertising costs. Rent expense and depreciation expense will be
targeted for reduction as well.

Further discussion on our
industry, the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included below in “Outlook.”

ESULTS

OF

O

PERATIONS

The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2003 compared
to 2002 and 2002 compared to 2001. Comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods, including the goodwill and asset impairment charges. These items are identified below in
“Other Items.”

Kroger’s 2003 financial results
were adversely affected by labor disputes in southern California and in the West Virginia area. These disputes, which are summarized below, adversely affected our sales, FIFO gross margin (as defined below) and operating, general and administrative
expenses. Our analysis includes estimates of the effects of these disputes on our 2003 results in these areas.

Labor dispute summary – southern California

Safeway Inc., Alberston’s, Inc. and Kroger, either directly or through their subsidiaries, (collectively, the “Retailers”) were party to
multi-employer bargaining with various local unions affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (“UFCW”) (collectively, the “Unions”) in southern California. The Retailers and the Unions entered
into agreements under which a strike against one employer would be deemed a strike against all employers. In addition, the Retailers entered into an agreement among themselves (the “Agreement”) requiring, among other things, that if one
employer were struck, the remaining employers would lock out bargaining unit employees. The Agreement was designed to prevent the Unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the Retailers by picketing one or more of the Retailers
but not the others. The Agreement is more fully described below in “Other Items.” On October 11, 2003, the Unions initiated a strike against Safeway, Inc. On October 12, 2003, the other Retailers locked out the bargaining unit employees as
required by the Agreement. As described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on February 29, 2004, the Company announced that it was notified by the UFCW that a new labor contract had been ratified by union members, ending a 141-day
work stoppage.

Labor dispute summary – West Virginia
area

On October 13, 2003, we temporarily closed 44 Kroger
stores, primarily in West Virginia, following a decision by a local union of the UFCW that represents workers in those stores to conduct a strike against Kroger. On December 11, 2003, Kroger announced that union members had ratified a new labor
contract covering employees in these 44 stores. We re-opened 41 of the stores on December 15, 2003. Three stores were not re-opened.

Sales

Total sales were $53.8 billion, $51.8 billion and $50.1 billion for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales represented annual increases of 3.9% in
2003 and 3.3% in 2002.

Total food store sales were $51.1
billion, $49.3 billion and $47.7 billion for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The differences between total sales and total food store sales primarily related to sales at our convenience store and jewelry store divisions and sales by our
manufacturing plants to outside firms.

We define a food store
as an identical store in the quarter after the store has been in operation and has not been expanded or relocated for four full quarters. We calculate annualized identical food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical sales.
Our annualized identical food store sales results are summarized in the table below.

Identical Food Store Sales

(In Millions)

We define a food store as a comparable store in the quarter after the store has been in operation for
four full quarters including expansions and relocations. We calculated annualized comparable food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales. Our annualized comparable food store sales results are summarized in the table
below.

Comparable Food Store Sales

(In Millions)

(1)

The labor disputes affected our sales results in several ways. In the West Virginia area, we temporarily closed 44 stores in response to a decision by a local union
to conduct a strike against Kroger. Our pharmacies in the area remained open. As a result, we did not realize any sales other than pharmacy sales at these 44 stores for approximately two months of 2003.

In southern California, sales results were negatively affected by picket
lines established outside of our Ralphs stores. Picket lines generally dissuade potential customers from entering our stores. Additionally, we were forced to hire temporary employees and transfer current employees from other areas to southern
California to staff the stores. Operating with fewer employees and, in most cases, less experienced replacement employees, our stores suffered sales losses due to increased inventory shortages, decreased customer service and the closure of selected
service departments. These negative sales effects were partially offset by sales increases at our Food 4 Less stores in the region that were not involved in the labor dispute. Also, sales at Ralphs stores were favorably affected during those weeks
when picket lines were removed from Ralphs stores.

Sales
figures adjusted for effects of the labor disputes exclude stores involved in labor disputes, as well as Food 4 Less stores whose sales results were favorably affected by the labor disputes in that region. Sales were excluded for the last four weeks
of our third quarters and the first six weeks of our fourth quarters for stores in the West Virginia area. Sales were excluded for the last five weeks of our third quarters and for our entire fourth quarters for the Ralphs and Food 4 Less stores.

Our sales in 2003 were also affected by inflation and
deflation in various commodity groups, the weak economy, increased competition and the results of our strategic initiatives. The estimated impact of inflation and deflation is described below in “Impact of Inflation.”

FIFO Gross Margin

We calculate First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) Gross Margin as follows:
Sales minus merchandise costs plus Last-In, First Out (“LIFO”) charge (credit). Merchandise costs include advertising, warehousing and transportation, but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense. FIFO gross margin is an important
measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness.

Our FIFO gross margin rates were 26.38%, 26.85% and 27.39% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These declining rates reflect our investment in lower retail prices. The effect of our investment in lower retail prices
was partially offset by decreases in product costs due to consolidated purchasing activities. Improved private label sales and manufacturing plant results also increased our FIFO gross margin rates in 2003, 2002 and 2001 because those products carry
a higher margin than national brand products. Other items recorded as merchandise costs in 2003 and 2002 further affected our FIFO gross margin rates. These items, which include estimates of the effects of the labor disputes, are described below in
“Other Items.”

Operating, General and Administrative Expenses

Operating, general and administrative
(“OG&A”) expenses, which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs, as a percent of sales were 19.25%, 18.58% and 18.93% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
OG&A expenses for 2003 were affected by the labor disputes and several items that are more fully described below in “Other Items.” In addition to those items, our OG&A expense rate in 2003 was adversely affected by higher health
care benefit and pension costs. A portion of the decrease in our rate in 2002 versus 2001 was due to the successful cost reduction and productivity

initiatives associated with the Strategic Growth Plan that we announced in December 2001. Our OG&A rate declined in 2002 despite increases in our health
care benefit costs, pension costs and credit card fees.

Rent Expense

Rent expense, as a percent of
sales, was 1.21%, 1.27% and 1.30% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decreases in these rates reflect our current strategy on ownership of real estate.

Depreciation Expense

Depreciation expense, as a percent of sales, was 2.25%, 2.10% and 1.94% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increases in depreciation expense
primarily were due to Kroger’s capital investment program and the ownership of real estate.

Goodwill Amortization

In 2001, goodwill amortization expense totaled $103 million. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
which became effective for Kroger on February 3, 2002, goodwill was not amortized beginning in 2002.

Goodwill Impairment Charge

Our annual impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of 2003 resulted in a goodwill impairment charge related to our Smith’s division
totaling $444 million. Details of the charge are included in “Other Items.”

Asset Impairment Charges

Asset impairment charges totaling $120 million and $91 million were recorded during 2003 and 2001. The impairments represented write-downs of under-performing stores to estimated fair market values. The impairment charges are explained more
fully in “Other Items.”

Interest Expense

Net interest expense totaled $604 million, $619 million
and $648 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in 2003 primarily resulted from lower average borrowings in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease in 2002, when compared to 2001, resulted from lower interest rates on our
floating-rate debt in 2002 versus 2001. Interest expense in 2003 and 2002 included $18 million and $19 million, respectively, due to the early retirement of debt.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 59.1%, 37.5% and 39.1% in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The effective rates for 2003 and 2002 differ from the effective rate for
2001 due to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill in 2003 and the amortization of goodwill in 2001. The effective income tax rates also differ from the expected statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes.

Net Earnings

Net earnings totaled $315 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in 2003.
These results represent a decrease of approximately 72.4% from net earnings of $1.52 per diluted share for 2002. The decrease in net earnings was affected significantly by the labor disputes, impairment charges and several other items that are
described below in “Other Items.”

Net earnings of
$1.52 per diluted share for 2002 represented an increase of approximately 20.6% over net earnings of $1.26 per diluted share for 2001. Adjusting 2001 results to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect, as illustrated in Note 5 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, net earnings would have been $1.37 per diluted share in 2001. Adjusting the 2002 results for the cumulative effect of the accounting change, net earnings would have been $1.54 in 2002. On this basis, net
earnings of $1.54 per diluted share for 2002 represented an increase of approximately 12.4% over net earnings of $1.37 per diluted share for 2001.

TEMS

The following table summarizes items that affected Kroger’s financial results during the periods presented. These items
should not be considered alternatives to net earnings, net cash provided by operating activities or any other Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (“GAAP”) measure of performance or liquidity. These items should not be viewed in
isolation or considered substitutes for Kroger’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Due to the nature of these items, as described below, it is important to identify these items and review them in conjunction with Kroger’s
financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.

These
items include a goodwill impairment charge, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges, merger-related costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change, all of which are shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The
items also include charges and credits that were recorded as components of FIFO gross margin, LIFO charge (credit), OG&A expense and interest expense. Additionally, items in 2003 included the estimated effects of the labor disputes.

FIFO gross margin is defined above in “Results of Operations.”

resulted in a write off of our jewelry store division goodwill.

Items Affecting FIFO Gross Margin, LIFO Charge (Credit) and Operating, General and Administrative
Expense

Estimated effect of labor disputes

For dispute-affected regions, we assumed that trends existing
prior to the effect of the labor disputes would have continued. Based on those trends, the estimated effects included the differences between reported sales and sales projections less reported merchandising costs and merchandising cost projections
and the differences between reported OG&A and OG&A projections. The estimates included differences at strike-affected stores as well as differences at Food 4 Less stores in southern California whose financial results were affected by the
labor dispute.

Differences affecting FIFO gross margin
included incremental warehousing, distribution, advertising and inventory shrinkage expenses due to the labor disputes. Differences in OG&A included direct pre-strike expenses, costs associated with hiring and training replacement workers, costs
associated with bringing in employees from other Kroger divisions to work on a temporary basis in the Ralphs stores and expenses under the Agreement.

As described above in “Results of Operations,” the Agreement entered into in connection with the multi-employer collective bargaining
arrangement among the Retailers was designed to prevent the Unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the Retailers by picketing one or more of the Retailers but not the others. The Agreement provided for payments from any of
the Retailers who gained from such disproportionate pressure to any of the Retailers who suffered from such disproportionate pressure, based on a percentage of the sales deemed caused by the disproportionate pressure. Expenses related to the
Agreement were recorded as OG&A and totaled approximately $116 million, pre-tax, in fiscal 2003. Amounts will be paid under the Agreement in the first quarter of 2004.

Furthermore, changes in our obligations for health care in the new labor agreement triggered an obligation under our
previous southern California labor contract that required us to make a contribution of approximately $31 million, pre-tax, to the Union’s health and welfare trust fund. Expenses related to this contribution were recorded as OG&A in fiscal
2003. The new labor contract also provides for a contract ratification bonus to be paid by the Retailers. Our expenses related to this ratification bonus will be recorded as OG&A in 2004. Both our contribution to the trust fund and the
ratification bonus were paid in the first quarter of 2004.

Item-cost conversion

In 1998, prior to the
merger with Fred Meyer, we changed our application of the LIFO method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item-cost method. The change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the
averaging and estimating inherent in the retail method.

During
the fourth quarter of 2002, we adopted the item-cost method for the former Fred Meyer divisions. The cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to February 3, 2002, cannot be determined. The effect of the change on the February 3, 2002
inventory valuation, which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods, was included in results for the quarter ended May 25, 2002. This change increased merchandise costs by $91 million and reduced net earnings by $57
million. We did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because we were unable to determine cost information for these periods. The item-cost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on February 3,
2002.

Adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 02-16

We adopted EITF Issue
No. 02-16 during the fourth quarter of 2002. This issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances. Due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the
item cost of inventory. Historically, we had recognized those allowances as they were earned, based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract. This accounting treatment was consistent with GAAP. For all contracts entered into or
modified after January 1, 2003, we have recognized prospectively, and will continue to recognize, vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold, in accordance with Issue 02-16. Net earnings in 2002 were not affected by the adoption of Issue
No. 02-16. Adoption of the Issue resulted in a $28 million pre-tax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002. This expense was offset by a corresponding $28 million pre-tax LIFO credit that also was included in merchandise costs in 2002.

Lease liabilities – Store Closing Plans

In connection with the 2001 asset impairment review described below, we
recorded pre-tax OG&A expenses of $20 million in 2001 for the present value of lease liabilities for the leased stores identified for closure. In 2000, we also recorded pre-tax expenses of $67 million for the present value of lease liabilities
for similar store closings. The 2000 liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the Fred Meyer merger, or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger, that were identified as
under-performing stores. In both years, liabilities were recorded for the planned closings of the stores.

Due to operational changes, performance improved at five stores that had not yet closed. As a result of this improved performance, in the first quarter of
2003 we modified our original plans and determined that these five locations will remain open. Additionally, closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated. In total, in the first quarter
of 2003, we recorded pre-tax income of $10 million to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through 2020 at the locations remaining under the plans. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional details of these liabilities.

No charges were
recorded in 2003 for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the 2003 asset impairment review. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, these
liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed. Most of the locations are expected to close during 2004. As a result, we expect to record pre-tax charges totaling approximately $25 million to $32 million during 2004.

Excess energy purchase commitments

During the third quarter of 2001, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $81
million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity. SFAS No. 133 required the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through
current-period earnings each quarter. We recorded pre-tax expense of $4 million and pre-tax income of $19 million as a result of the market value adjustment of these excess commitments in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Market value adjustments in the
fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in a pre-tax charge of $2 million.

During the second quarter of 2003, we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements in California with Dynegy, Inc., related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for
as normal purchases normal sales contracts. The Federal Energy Regulatory commission approved the agreement on July 23, 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, we paid $107 million, before the related tax benefits, to settle disputes with Dynegy
related to prior over-payments, terminate two of the four contracts effective July 6, 2003, and terminate the remaining two agreements effective September 1, 2003. As a result of the settlement, we recorded $62 million of pre-tax expense in the
second quarter of 2003.

Property Tax Allowance

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded pre-tax income of
$20 million related to the reversal of a property tax accrual. We have determined the amount to be paid will be less than we originally estimated.

Power Outage

In the second quarter of 2003, we recorded a $9 million pre-tax expense for the August power outage in northwest Ohio and Michigan. The majority of the
expense related to uninsured product losses. Generally, we classify uninsured product and property losses as OG&A expense.

Adjustment to Charitable Contribution Liability

In the second quarter of 2003, we recorded $5 million of pre-tax income to adjust previously recorded liabilities related to charitable contributions
required as a result of the Fred Meyer merger. We are required to make these contributions by May 2006.

Items Affecting Interest Expense

We adopted SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections,” in
the first quarter of 2003. As a result, expenses related to the early retirement of debt, which were recorded as extraordinary items prior to the issuance of SFAS No. 145, are now classified as interest expense in the respective periods. The 2003
expenses of $18 million, pre-tax, related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of $100 million of long-term bonds, and the write-off of the related deferred financing costs.

Goodwill Impairment Charge

We performed the annual evaluation of goodwill required by SFAS No. 142 during the fourth quarter of 2003. This review
resulted in a $444 million non-cash impairment charge related to the goodwill at our Smith’s division. The impairment charge, which is non-deductible for income tax purposes, adjusted the carrying value of the division’s goodwill to its
implied fair value. In 2003, the Smith’s division experienced a substantial decline in operating performance when compared with 2002 results and budgeted 2003 results. Additionally, we have forecasted a further decline in the future operating
performance of this division. The decline in expected performance reflects both investments in capital and targeted retail price reductions intended to maintain and grow market share and provide acceptable long-term return on capital. No impairment
was indicated during this review for goodwill at our other divisions.

Asset Impairment Charges and Related Items

In
accordance with our policy on impairment of long-lived assets, we identified impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during 2003 and 2001. These losses, which are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings as “Asset impairment charges,” totaled $120 million and $91 million, pre-tax, in 2003 and 2001, respectively. In both years, the impairment reviews were conducted as a consequence of a corporate-level strategic plan that
coordinated the closings of several locations over a relatively short period of time. The 2001 charge related to investments by acquired companies in stores opened shortly after the Fred Meyer merger that did not perform as expected during 2000 and
2001. Based on those results and forecasts for 2002 and beyond, we performed an impairment review in the third quarter of 2001 that resulted in a pre-tax charge of $91 million. The 2003 charge related to locations whose operating performance
deteriorated subsequent to the 2001 review. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on results for 2002 and 2003, as well as updated projections for 2004 and beyond. This event
triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several other under-performing locations in the fourth quarter of 2003. The review resulted in a pre-tax charge totaling $120 million. These charges are more fully described in
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restructuring Charges

On December 11, 2001,
we outlined our Strategic Growth Plan to support additional investment in our core business to increase sales and market share. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $37 million primarily for severance
agreements associated with the Plan. Restructuring charges related to the Plan totaled $15 million, pre-tax, in 2002. The majority of the 2002 expenses related to severance agreements, distribution center consolidation and conversion costs. No
restructuring charges were recorded in 2003. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these charges.

Merger-Related Costs

During 2002 and 2001, we recorded, pre-tax expenses of $1 million and $4 million, respectively, from the issuance of restricted stock and the related
market value adjustments. The restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in 2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the Fred Meyer merger. No merger-related costs were recorded in 2003. Refer to Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these charges.

Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change

As noted above in “Results of Operations,” we adopted SFAS No. 142 on February 3, 2002. The transitional impairment review required by SFAS No. 142 resulted in a $26 million pre-tax non-cash loss to write
off the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value. Impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division’s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis, rather
than on an undiscounted basis, as was the standard under SFAS No. 121, prior to adoption of SFAS No. 142. We recorded this loss as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of a $10 million tax benefit, in the first quarter of 2002.

ROGRAM

In December of 1999, we began a
program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit of these exercises. On March 1, 2001, our Board
authorized the repurchase of an incremental $1 billion of Kroger common stock. During fiscal 2001, we made open market purchases of $343 million under the $1 billion authorization and $209 million under previous Board authorizations. During fiscal
2002, we made open market purchases of approximately $657 million to complete the $1 billion program. Effective December 10, 2002, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling $500 million. We made open market purchases of $277
million and $63 million under this plan in 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of April 9, 2004, we have repurchased approximately $103 million under

this program in fiscal 2004. We also reacquired approximately $24 million, $65 million and $180 million under the stock option program in fiscal 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. Purchases of stock under the Board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital.

Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled $2.0 billion in 2003 compared to $1.9 billion in 2002 and $1.9 billion in 2001. Most amounts were used
to construct new stores. Capital expenditures included $202 million, $192 million and $76 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease. The table below shows our

OLICIES

We have
chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are
summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

Self-Insurance Costs

We primarily are self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate,
using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 31, 2004. Case-reserves are established for reported claims using
case-basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as more information becomes known.

The liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis. The difference between the discounted and undiscounted
workers’ compensation liabilities was $32 million as of January 31, 2004. We have purchased stop-loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim
limits.

The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of
existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts
realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes
in

historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities.

Impairments of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history
of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, an impairment calculation is performed, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow
information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If impairment is identified for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset’s current
carrying value. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based
on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. Impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal.

The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our
estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections project several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition.

We perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels. Generally, for reviews performed by local
management, costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as “Operating, general and administrative” expense. Cost to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets that
result from corporate-level strategic plans are separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as “Asset impairment charges.” Refer to “Other Items” for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during
2003 and 2001.

Goodwill

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year,
and also upon the occurrence of trigger events. The reviews are performed at the operating division level. Generally, fair value represents a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and is compared to the carrying value of a
division for purposes of identifying potential impairment. If potential for impairment is identified, the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an
implied fair value of the division’s goodwill. Goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value. Results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2003
and 2002 are summarized in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different
organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Similar to our policy on impairment of long-lived assets, the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation,
the economy and market competition.

Store Closing Costs

We provide for closed store liabilities relating to the
present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent
payments on closed stores. The closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities
primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. Store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly
to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to income in the proper period.

We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values
based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. However, the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and related
assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions.

Owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value. Costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and
leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long-lived assets. Inventory

write-downs, if any, in connection with store closings, are classified in “Merchandise costs.” Cost to transfer inventory and equipment from closed
stores are expensed as incurred.

Benefit Plans

The determination of our obligation and expense for
company-sponsored pension plans and other post-retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and
include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ
from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences
in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the impact of a 1% change
in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post-retirement benefit costs and the related liability.

The discount rate is based primarily on the yield on high-quality fixed income investments as of the measurement date. We lowered the discount rate to
6.25% as of January 31, 2004, from 6.75% as of February 1, 2003. The 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 31, 2004, by $110 million. In 2004, we expect that the annual pension
expense will increase by $11 million as a result of this change.

To determine the expected return on pension plan assets, we contemplate current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories. We reduced the pension return assumption to
8.50% for 2003 from 9.50% for 2002. Our pension plan’s average return for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2003, was 9.6%, net of all investment management fees and expenses. We believe the reduction in the pension return assumption was
appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return. We estimate that our 2003 pension expense increased approximately $14 million as a result of the reduction
in expected return from 9.50% to 8.50%.

On February 18, 2003,
we made a cash contribution of $100 million to our pension plans. We are required to make a cash contribution of $34 million by September 15, 2004, and we intend to contribute an additional $149 million by September 15, 2004. We expect the
additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years. Among other things, performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes
in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions.

We also participate in various multi-employer plans for substantially all employees represented by unions. We are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining
agreements. Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits are generally based on a fixed amount for each year of service. We contributed $169 million, $153 million and $114 million to these funds in fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. We would have contributed an additional $13 million to these plans in 2003 had there been no labor disputes. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe these multi-employer plans are underfunded.
The decline in the value of assets held in the funds supporting these plans, coupled with the high level of benefits generally provided, has led to the underfunding. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans will continue to increase
and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges. Two recently completed labor negotiations, including southern California, resulted in a reduction of liabilities (and, therefore, expected
contribution increases). These multi-employer funds are managed by trustees, appointed by management of the employers (including Kroger) and labor in equal number, who have fiduciary obligations to act prudently. Thus, while we expect contributions
to these funds to continue to increase as they have in recent years, the amount of increase will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees and the actual return on assets held in these funds. For these reasons, it
is not practicable to determine the amount by which our multi-employer pension contributions will increase. Moreover, if we were to exit markets, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability. Any adjustments for withdrawal liability will be
recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated.

Stock Option Plans

We
apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly, because the exercise price of the option granted equals the
market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date, no stock-based compensation expense is included in net earnings, other than expenses related to restricted stock awards. Notes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describe
the effect on net earnings if compensation

cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards, consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 97% of inventories for 2003 and approximately 95% of inventories for 2002 were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using
the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $324 million at January 31, 2004, and by $290 million at February 1, 2003. We follow the Link-Chain, Dollar-Value LIFO method for purposes of
calculating our LIFO charge or credit.

The item-cost method of
accounting is followed for substantially all non-perishable store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of
vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and
purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting.

We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based
on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the balance sheet date.

Cash Flow Information

Net cash provided by operating activities

We generated $2,215 million of cash from operations in 2003 compared to
$3,183 million in 2002 and $2,347 million in 2001. Lower earnings, including the effect of labor disputes, contributed to the decrease in cash provided in 2003 when compared to 2002. Conversely, increased earnings contributed to the increase in cash
provided in 2002 when compared to 2001.

Changes in our
operating assets and liabilities also affect the net amount of cash provided by our operating activities. During 2003, we realized a $260 million increase in operating assets and liabilities compared to a $299 million reduction during 2002 and a
$166 million increase during 2001. Fluctuations in our accounts payable balances contributed to the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2003 and 2002. In 2002, our accounts payable balances increased substantially due to an enterprise
systems conversion that enabled our western divisions to improve their accounts payable position. The decrease in our accounts payable balances in 2003 was primarily related to our decision to discontinue the practice of transferring deposits to our
concentration account prior to receiving credit for those deposits from other banks. The cost of this activity was minimal in 2002. Expected increases in bank fees made the activity non-economical in 2003. Offsetting the changes in our accounts
payable balances, our other current liabilities increased in 2003 as a result of the labor disputes discussed in “Other Items.”

The amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2003 and 2002 was lower than the amount paid in 2001 due, in part, to a tax law benefit that will continue
through 2004. Under current tax law, the bonus depreciation provision will expire in December 2004 and we expect the cash benefit will begin to reverse in 2005. This provision reduced our cash taxes by approximately $130 million, $106 million and
$22 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Our 2003
operating cash flow results also reflect a $100 million cash contribution to our company-sponsored pension plan.

Net cash used by investing activities

Cash used by investing activities was $2,026 million in 2003, compared to $1,907 million in 2002 and $1,914 million in 2001. The amount of cash used by
investing activities in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was relatively consistent among the years due to similar levels of capital spending, including acquisitions.

Net cash used by financing activities

Financing activities used $201 million of cash in 2003, compared to $1,266 million in 2002 and $433 million in 2001. The decrease in the use of cash in
2003 versus 2002 was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt and to a reduction in treasury stock purchases. The decreased use of cash was also due to increases in book overdrafts in 2003 versus 2002 as
well as to proceeds received in 2003 from interest rate swap terminations. The increase in the use of cash in 2002 versus 2001 was due to a reduction of our outstanding debt and to an increase in our treasury stock purchases in 2002 versus 2001.

Debt Management

Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of capital
leases, decreased $210 million to $8.4 billion as of year-end 2003 from $8.6 billion as of year-end 2002. Total debt decreased $256 million to $8.6 billion as of year-end 2002 from $8.8 billion as of year-end 2001. The decreases in 2003 and 2002
resulted, in part, from the use of cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Approximately $65 million of the decrease experienced in 2003 resulted from the consolidation of a financing entity. In prior years, we purchased a portion of
the debt issued by a mortgagor of certain of our properties to reduce our effective interest expense. Historically, these purchases were classified as investments on our balance sheet. These purchases totaled $67 million as of year-end 2002 and $68
million as of year-end 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” for this entity and determined that
it was required to be consolidated. Consolidation reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately $65 million. Refer to “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” for further details.

Our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee
benefit costs and by the mark-to-market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt, pursuant to SFAS No. 133. We had prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million at year-end 2003 and 2002 and $270
million at year-end 2001. The mark-to-market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by $104 million as of year-end 2003 and by $110 million as of year-end 2002. The mark-to-market adjustments reduced the carrying value of our debt by
$18 million as of year-end 2001.

Factors Affecting Liquidity

We currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $250 million to $350 million under our A


/F


rated commercial paper (“CP”) program. These borrowings are backed by our credit facilities, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities. We have capacity available under our credit facilities to
backstop all CP amounts outstanding. If our credit rating declined below its current level of BBB/BBB/Baa3, the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of
our credit rating. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. Borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current
CP program, depending on the current interest rate environment. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that access to the CP markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time
(i.e., in excess of 30 days).

Although our ability to borrow
under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our Applicable Percentage Ratio. Our credit
facilities also require the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our “financial covenants”). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. These
financial covenants and ratios are described below:

•

Our Applicable Percentage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Total Interest Expense, as defined in the credit facilities) was 5.40 to 1 as of January 31, 2004.
If this ratio declined to below 4.75 to 1, the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 0.25%. The cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would be similarly impacted by a one-level downgrade in our
credit rating.

•

Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facilities) was 2.58 to 1 as of January 31, 2004. If this ratio exceeded 3.50 to 1, we
would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired.

Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined
in the credit facilities) was 3.09 to 1 as of January 31, 2004. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired.

Consolidated EBITDA as defined in our credit facilities includes an
adjustment for unusual gains and losses. Our credit agreements are more particularly described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year-end 2003.

The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as
of January 31, 2004 (in millions of dollars):

(1)

These borrowings also are included in the long-term debt contractual obligation amounts.

We are required to make a cash contribution of
$34 million to our company-sponsored pension plan by September 15, 2004, and we intend to contribute an additional $149 million by September 15, 2004. We expect the additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce our minimum required
contributions in future years. Amounts shown in the table for 2005 and 2006 assume that we contribute $183 million by September 15, 2004. If we contribute only $34 million by September 15, 2004, our minimum required contributions would be $85
million in 2005 and $130 million in 2006. Among other things, performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional
contributions. At this time, it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for 2007 and beyond.

As described in “Other Items,” we expect to make payments of at least $147 million in 2004 related to the settlement of the labor dispute in
southern California. Additional amounts will be due for 2004 activity.

Our construction commitments include capital owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal
course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. Our obligations also include management fees
for facilities operated by third parties. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of January 31, 2004, we had an $812.5 million Five-Year Credit Agreement,
a $700 million Five-Year Credit Agreement and a $1,000 million 364-Day Credit Agreement. The $812.5 million five-year facility terminates on May 23, 2006, unless extended or earlier terminated by Kroger. The $700 million five-year facility
terminates on May 22, 2007, unless extended or earlier terminated by Kroger. The 364-Day facility terminates on May 20, 2004, unless extended, converted into a one-year term loan, or earlier terminated by Kroger. At January 31, 2004, we also
maintained a $75 million money market line. In addition to credit agreement borrowings, borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under our credit agreements. At January 31, 2004, these
letters of credit totaled $227 million. We had no borrowings under the money market line at January 31, 2004. The credit agreement borrowings have been classified as long-term borrowings because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced
using the same type of facilities. We have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis, and have presented the amounts accordingly. The money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates,
usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements.

At January 31, 2004, we also had a $100 million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided
capacity incremental to the $2.5 billion described above. Funds received under this $100 million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities. Collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to
initiate the drawing of funds under the facility. As of January 31, 2004, we had no borrowings under this additional $100 million facility.

In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 31, 2004, we had available for issuance $1.5 billion of securities under a shelf
registration statement filed with the SEC on June 27, 2002, as amended in a filing made on July 18, 2002, and declared effective on July 23, 2002.

We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self-insured insurance costs. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self-insured
for workers’ compensation and general liability exposures, and are made with third-party insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments. These bonds do not represent
liabilities of Kroger, as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs. However, we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances,
availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds,
if this does become an issue, we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements. This could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities.

Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally,
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and some of its subsidiaries. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness
of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50% ownership. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss, should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $7 million. Based on the
covenants underlying this indebtedness as of January 31, 2004, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We have also guaranteed approximately $5 million of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership. We
believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in 2012.

At February 1, 2003, we were a party to a financing transaction related to 16 properties that were constructed for total costs of approximately $202
million. Under the terms of the financing transaction, which was structured as a synthetic lease, a special purpose trust owned the properties and leased them to subsidiaries of Kroger. The lease had a term of five years, which expired on February
28, 2003. The owner of the special purpose trust made a substantive residual equity investment. The transaction, therefore, was accounted for as an operating lease and the related costs were reported as rent expense. Kroger purchased the assets for
total costs of $202 million when the lease expired.

We are
also contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill
their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote.

NFLATION

While we believe that Kroger’s sales results are
affected by product cost inflation and deflation, it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation and deflation on our retail prices because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year-to-year and other pricing and
competitive influences. In 2003, we estimate that Kroger experienced overall product cost inflation of 1.1% compared to product cost deflation of 0.3% in 2002. We recorded a pre-tax LIFO charge of $34 million in 2003 compared to a pre-tax LIFO
credit of $50 million in 2002, including a $28 million pre-tax credit recorded as a result of the adoption of EITF 02-16 in the fourth quarter of 2002.

TANDARDS

SFAS No. 132, “Employer’s Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits” was revised by the
FASB in December 2003. The revised statement requires new annual disclosures about the types of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations and cash flows as well as components of the net periodic benefit cost recognized in
interim periods. The new annual disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, except for the disclosure of expected future benefit payment, which must be disclosed for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Interim
period disclosures are generally effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. We have included the disclosures required by SFAS No. 132 in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

SFAS No. 143, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” was issued by the FASB in August of 2001. This
standard addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 became effective for Kroger on February 2, 2003. Adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 145,
“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections,” was issued by the FASB in April of 2002. SFAS No. 145 became effective for Kroger on February 2, 2003. This Statement
eliminates the requirement that gains and losses due to the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. Adoption of SFAS No. 145 required us to reclassify the debt
extinguishments recorded as extraordinary items in 2002 as interest expense in the respective periods. These debt extinguishments were recorded during the first two quarters of 2002 and totaled $19 million of pre-tax expense. Pre-tax expense
totaling $18 million related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of $100 million of long-term bonds, and the write-off of the related deferred financing costs, was recorded in 2003.

FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” was issued by the FASB in January 2003 and revised in December 2003. FIN 46 provides guidance relating to the identification of, and financial reporting for, variable-interest entities, as defined in the
Interpretation. FIN 46 is effective for all variable-interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For any variable-interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003, FIN 46 became effective on February 1, 2004, the beginning of our first
quarter of 2004, unless earlier adopted, except for entities designated as special purpose entities for which the effective date was the fourth quarter of 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we adopted FIN 46 for a mortgagor (the
“Mortgagor”) of certain of our properties. In prior years, we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the Mortgagor to reduce our effective interest expense. These purchases were classified as investments in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Consolidation of the Mortgagor reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately $65 million. Consolidation of the Mortgagor had an immaterial effect on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. We continue to review our partnerships, joint ventures and other financing arrangements for potential consolidation under this Interpretation. If we are required to consolidate any other entities in the first quarter of 2004, we anticipate
that such consolidation will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements.

EITF Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” was issued in November 2003. EITF Issue No. 03-10 addresses the accounting for
manufacturer sales incentives offered directly to consumers, including manufacturer coupons. EITF Issue No. 03-10 became effective for Kroger on February 1, 2004, the beginning of our first quarter of 2004. We believe the adoption of EITF Issue No.
03-10 will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements.

SFAS No. 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” was issued by the FASB in January 2004. SFAS No. 106-1 allows for a one-time election
to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization act of 2003 (“Prescription Drug Act”). The Prescription Drug Act, which was signed into law in December 2003, in addition to creating a
federal prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans which provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The Prescription
Drug Act introduces two new programs to Medicare, a subsidy to plan sponsors based on 28% of an individual beneficiary’s annual prescription drug costs between $250 and $5,000 and a option for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefit under
Medicare, that must be taken into consideration when measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit. SFAS No. 106-1 does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effect of the Prescription Drug Act in its
financial statements.

We have elected to defer adoption of
SFAS No. 106-1 due to a lack of specific guidance. As such, the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect the impact on the plans of the
Prescription Drug Act. Until further specific guidance is provided, we will continue to defer adoption of SFAS No. 106-1. Authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and, when issued, may require information
previously reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements to change. We will continue to investigate the impact of SFAS No. 106-1 initial recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not
expect adoption of SFAS No. 106-1 will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

UTLOOK

This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements about Kroger’s future performance. These statements are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such
statements relate to, among other things: projected change in net earnings; identical sales growth; expected pension plan contributions; our ability to generate operating cash flow; projected capital expenditures; square footage growth;
opportunities to reduce costs; cash flow requirements; and our operating plan for the future; and are indicated by words or phrases such as “comfortable,” “committed,” “expect,” “goal,” “should,”
“target,” and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs,
intentions or strategies are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our
ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements.

•

We obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. We expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by
including numerous specialty departments, such as pharmacies, natural food markets, supermarket fuel centers, seafood shops, floral shops, and bakeries. We believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from
other food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers, club or warehouse stores, drug stores and restaurants. We expect identical food store sales for 2004, excluding fuel, to be stronger than our fourth quarter of 2003 results of 1.3%, excluding
stores affected by labor disputes. This assumes the economic and competitive environment will remain unchanged.

•

Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis on self-development and ownership of real estate, and on logistics and
technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology focused on improved store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, should reduce merchandising costs as a percent
of sales. Capital spending for fiscal 2003 was $2.1 billion, including acquisitions and the purchase of assets financed under the synthetic lease at February 1, 2003. We intend to use the combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under
credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements. If determined preferable, we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities, entering into sale/leaseback transactions, or by issuing additional debt or equity. We
expect capital investment for 2004 to be in the range of $1.8 - $2.0 billion, excluding acquisitions. Total food store square footage is expected to grow 2-3% before acquisitions and operational closings.

•

Based on current operating results, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit
facilities, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants
to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions.

•

We expect that our OG&A results will be affected by increased costs, such as health care benefit costs, pension costs, utility costs and credit card fees, as well as any future
labor disputes.

•

We expect earnings in 2004 to be lower than in 2003, excluding the effect of the labor dispute and unusual items. It is not possible for Kroger to provide a more precise earnings
estimate for 2004 because of the inherent uncertainties in: the cost of the labor dispute in southern California; the time and investment needed to rebuild our business in the affected areas; and the investment necessary to meet Kroger’s plan
to drive sales growth.

•

We plan to continue using one-third of cash flow for debt reduction and two-thirds for stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend.

•

We have achieved significant cost savings over the past two years. We believe that in 2004 there will be additional opportunities to reduce our operating costs in areas such as
administration, labor, shrink, warehousing and transportation. These savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers.

•

In addition to the $100 million contributed during the first quarter of 2003, we expect to make cash contributions to the company-sponsored pension plans in the current and upcoming
years. We are required to make a cash contribution of $34 million by September 15, 2004. We intend to contribute an additional $149 million by September 15, 2004. We expect the additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce our contributions
in future years. Among other things, performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions.

•

In addition to the company-sponsored pension plans, we also participate in various multi-employer pension plans for substantially all employees represented by unions. We are
required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits are generally based on a fixed amount for each year of
service. We contributed $169 million, $153 million and $114 million to these funds in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We would have contributed an additional $13 million to these plans in 2003 had there been no labor disputes. Based on the most
recent information available to us, we believe these multi-employer plans are underfunded. The decline in the value of assets held in the funds supporting these plans, coupled with the high level of benefits generally provided, has led to the
underfunding. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges. Two recently completed labor negotiations, including
southern California, resulted in a reduction of liabilities (and, therefore, expected contribution increases). These multi-employer funds are managed by trustees, appointed by management of the employers (including Kroger) and labor in equal number,
who have fiduciary obligations to act prudently. Thus, while we expect contributions to these funds to continue to increase as they have in recent years, the amount of increase will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by
trustees and the actual return on assets held in these funds. For these reasons, it is not practicable to determine the amount by which our multi-employer pension contributions will increase. Moreover, if we were to exit markets, we may be required
to pay a withdrawal liability. Any adjustments for withdrawal liability well be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated.

Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include:

•

We currently have contract extensions in Arizona, a portion of Indiana, Houston, Louisville and Food 4 Less in southern California. Those extensions are subject to termination by
either party following notice. We are actively pursuing negotiation of new agreements in those areas. We remain hopeful, but cannot be certain, that we can reach satisfactory agreements without work stoppages in those markets. In 2004, we have major
contracts expiring in: Seattle; Nashville; Detroit; Denver; Las Vegas, and Cincinnati. In all of these contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a
substantial number of stores could have a material effect on our results.

•

Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals will be affected by: labor disputes, industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors,
including non-traditional competitors; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; stock repurchases and the success of our future growth plans.

•

In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private-label sales, the impact of “sister stores,”
and reductions in retail pricing. Kroger’s EPS growth goals could be affected by: recessionary trends in the economy; our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we have identified, including those to reduce shrink and OG&A; continued
increases in health care, pension and credit card fees; and the success of our capital investments.

•

Our ability to achieve our cost savings goals could be affected by our ability to achieve productivity improvements and shrink reduction; the impact of current or future labor
disputes; efficiencies in our distribution centers and those created by our logistics projects; and competitive activity in the marketplace in which we operate.

•

The amount of contributions made to our pension and multi-employer plans will be affected by the performance of investments made by the plans as well as the extent to which trustees
of the plans reduce the costs of future service benefits.

•

We have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business and believe we have made adequate provisions for them. Unexpected outcomes in
these matters could result in an adverse effect on our earnings.

•

The proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt, repurchase common stock, or pay a cash dividend may be affected by the market price of Kroger common stock, the amount
of outstanding debt available for pre-payment and changes in borrowing rates.

•

Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen.

•

The results of our future growth plans, including the amount and timing of cost savings expected, could be adversely affected due to pricing and promotional activities of existing
and new competitors, including non-traditional retailers; our response actions; the state of the economy, including deflationary trends in certain commodities; recessionary times in the economy, our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we
have identified, including those to reduce shrink and operating, general and administrative expense; increase in health care, pension and credit card fees; and the success of our capital investments.

•

Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of individual assets, or remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight-line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write-offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method
of depreciation was followed.

•

The grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce competition from other food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers club or warehouse stores, drug stores and
restaurants. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses, including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements. The competitive
environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales, thus reducing margins. While we believe our opportunities for sustained, profitable growth are considerable, unanticipated actions of competitors could
adversely affect our sales.

•

Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, and environmental laws may have a material impact on our financial statements.

•

Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth, and employment and job growth in the markets in
which we operate, may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. General economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could
affect sales and earnings.

•

Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we have added and will continue to add supermarket fuel centers. Since gasoline generates
low profit margins but significant sales, we expect to see our gross profit margins decrease as we sell more gasoline. Although this negatively affects our gross profit margin, gasoline provides a positive effect on operating, general and
administrative expense as a percent of sales.

•

Our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired, and achieve operating improvements at those companies, will affect our operations.

•

Our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted, or if our
logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget.

•

Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Additionally, increases in the
cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively impact financial ratios and net earnings.

•

Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported
goods. If we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers, our gross margin and net earnings will suffer.

We cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on Kroger’s business. We have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change
significantly for 2004.

Other factors and assumptions not identified above
could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward-looking
statements made by us or our representatives.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Risk Management

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse
fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic
exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate
derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets.

We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate
protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average
daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii)
include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status.

As of January 31, 2004, we maintained 10 interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $1,825 million, to manage our
exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. These agreements mature at varying times between March 2005 and March
2008. Variable rates for our agreements are based on U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the
agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges.

During 2003, we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges. Approximately $114 million of proceeds received
as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt. As of January 31, 2004, the unamortized balances totaled approximately $98. We
also initiated 10 new interest rate swap agreements during 2003 that are being accounted for as fair value hedges. As of January 31, 2004, assets totaling $6 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these new agreements, offset by
increases in the fair value of the underlying debt.

As of
January 31, 2004, we also maintained one interest rate swap agreement, with a notional amount of $300 million, to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt
from variable to fixed rates. The agreement, which matured in February 2004, involved the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. The variable rate for this agreement was
based on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received was accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreement and recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest
expense. This agreement was accounted for as a cash flow hedge.

Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines. In addition, our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis. The guidelines may
change as our business needs dictate.

The tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as
of January 31, 2004. The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of January 31, 2004. Interest rates
reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of January 31, 2004. The Fair-Value
column includes the fair-value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of January 31, 2004. Refer to Notes 8, 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements:

Commodity Price
Protection

We enter into purchase commitments for various
resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. We enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those
resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. For any commitments for
which we do not expect to take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis.

As noted above in “Other Items,” we recorded a pre-tax loss of $81 million in the third quarter of 2001 to accrue liabilities for the estimated
fair value of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases normal sales exception. We marked the excess contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis through June 2003. During the second quarter of 2003, we reached an agreement
through which we ended supply arrangements related to these contracts.

The
Kroger Co.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, changes in shareowners’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Kroger Co. and its subsidiaries at January 31, 2004 and
February 1, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

OLICIES

The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparing these financial statements:

Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation

The Kroger Co. (the “Company”)
was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. As of January 31, 2004, the Company was one of the largest grocery retailers in the United States based on annual sales. The Company also manufactures and processes food for sale by its supermarkets. The
Company employs approximately 290,000 full and part-time employees. The accompanying financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. The
last three fiscal years consist of the 52-week period ended January 31, 2004, the 52-week period ended February 1, 2003, and the 52-week period ended February 2, 2002.

Pervasiveness of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of consolidated revenues and expenses during the
reporting period also is required. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a last-in, first-out “LIFO” basis) or market. In total, approximately 97% of inventories for 2003 and approximately 95% of inventories for 2002 were valued using the LIFO
method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $324 at January 31, 2004 and $290 at February 1, 2003. The Company
follows the Link-Chain, Dollar-Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating its LIFO charge or credit.

The item-cost method of accounting is followed for substantially all non-perishable store inventories at the Company’s supermarket divisions. This
method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item-cost method of accounting allows
for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company adopted the item-cost method
of accounting for the former Fred Meyer divisions. The cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to February 3, 2002, cannot be determined. The effect of the change on the February 3, 2002 inventory valuation, which includes other immaterial
modifications in inventory valuation methods, was included in results for the quarter ended May 25, 2002. This change increased merchandise costs by $91 and reduced net earnings by $57. The Company did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior
periods because the Company was unable to determine cost information for these periods. The item-cost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on February 3, 2002.

The Company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual
physical counts in its facilities. Allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the balance sheet date.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Generally, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets
recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or remaining terms of leases. Buildings and land improvements are depreciated based on lives varying from 10
to 40 years. Some store equipment acquired as a result of the Fred Meyer merger was assigned a 15-year life. The life of this equipment was not changed. All new purchases of store equipment are assigned lives varying from three to nine years.
Manufacturing plant and distribution center

equipment is depreciated over lives varying from three to 15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the leases to which they relate,
which vary from four to 25 years. Depreciation expense was $1,209 in 2003, $1,087 in 2002, and $973 in 2001.

Interest costs on significant projects constructed for the Company’s own use are capitalized as part of the costs of the newly constructed
facilities. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings.

Goodwill

During 2001, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Goodwill amortization expense totaled $103 in 2001. The Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142 on February 3, 2002. Accordingly, goodwill was not amortized during 2002 and 2003. Instead, goodwill was reviewed for impairment during the first and fourth quarters of 2002, and
also during the fourth quarter of 2003. Results of these impairment reviews are summarized in Note 5.

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of trigger events. The reviews are
performed at the operating division level. Generally, fair value represents a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows. Potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a division, including goodwill, exceeds its
fair value. If potential for impairment exists, the fair value of a division is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the division’s
goodwill. Impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division’s goodwill over the implied fair value.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the Company monitors the carrying value of
long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant
decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, an impairment calculation is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific
stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If impairment is identified for long-lived assets to be held and used, discounted future cash flows are compared to the asset’s current carrying value. Impairment is recorded when the carrying
value exceeds the discounted cash flows. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and
current economic conditions. Impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal.

The Company performs impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels. Generally, for reviews performed by local
divisional management, costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as “Operating, general and administrative” expense. Cost to reduce the carrying value of long-lived
assets that result from corporate–level strategic plans are separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as “Asset impairment charges.” Refer to Note 3 for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during
2003 and 2001.

Store Closing Costs

All closed store liabilities related to exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002, are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The Company provides for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of
the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. The Company estimates the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments
on closed stores. The closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate
to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. Store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that
any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to income in the proper period.

Owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value. Costs to reduce the carrying values of
property, equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long-lived assets. Inventory write-downs, if any, in connection with store closings, are classified in “Merchandise costs.”
Costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company’s
current program relative to interest rate protection and the methods by which the Company accounts for its derivative instruments are described in Note 9.

Commodity Price Protection

The Company enters into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in its manufacturing facilities and energy to be used
in its stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. The Company enters into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of the normal course of business. The Company’s current program
relative to commodity price protection and the methods by which the Company accounts for its purchase commitments are described in Note 9.

Benefit Plans

The determination of the obligation and expense for company-sponsored pension plans and other post-retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of
assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 18 and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and
health care costs. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect the recognized expense and recorded
obligation in future periods. While the Company believes that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post-retirement obligations
and future expense.

The Company also participates in various
multi-employer plans for substantially all union employees. Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Refer to Note 18 for additional details of these plans.

Stock Option Plans

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. The Company grants options for common stock at an option price equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of the
grant. Accordingly, the Company does not record stock-based compensation expense for these options. The Company also makes restricted stock awards. Compensation expense included in net earnings for restricted stock awards totaled approximately $8,
$6 and $8 after-tax, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company’s stock option plans are more fully described in Note 13.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings, net earnings per basic common share and net earnings per diluted common share if compensation
cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123:

(1)

Refer to Note 13 for a summary of the assumptions used for options issued in each year at an option price equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of
the grant.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting bases. Refer to Note 7 for the types of differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as a net current or noncurrent
asset or liability based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. A deferred tax asset or liability that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting is classified according to the
expected reversal date. A valuation allowance is recorded for any deferred tax assets considered not likely to be realized.

Self-Insurance Costs

The Company primarily is self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims. Liabilities are actuarially determined
and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage to limit
its exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. The Company is insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits.

The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability
recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can impact amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of
how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although the Company’s estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable impact on future
claim costs and currently recorded liabilities.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenues from the sale of products are
recognized at the point of sale of the Company’s products. Discounts provided to customers by the Company at the time of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold.

Merchandise Costs

In addition to the product costs, net of discounts and allowances;
advertising costs (see separate discussion below); inbound freight charges; warehousing costs, including receiving and inspection costs; transportation costs; and manufacturing production and operational costs are included in the “Merchandise
costs” line item of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Warehousing, transportation and manufacturing management salaries are also included in the “Merchandise costs” line item, however, purchasing management salaries and
administration costs are included in the “Operating, general, and administrative” line item along with most of the Company’s other managerial and administrative costs. Rent expense and depreciation expense are shown separately in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Warehousing and
transportation costs include distribution center direct wages, repairs and maintenance, utilities, inbound freight and, where applicable, third party warehouse management fees, as well as transportation direct wages and repairs and maintenance.
These costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred.

Whenever possible, vendor rebates, credits and promotional allowances that relate to the Company’s buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in
merchandise costs when the item is sold. Due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory. In those instances, the allowances are applied as a reduction
of merchandise costs when the related merchandise is sold, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting By A Customer (Including A Reseller) For Certain Consideration Received From A
Vendor.”

The Company adopted Issue No. 02-16 during the
fourth quarter of 2002. As noted above, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory. Historically, the Company had recognized those allowances as they were earned, based on the fulfillment of the related
obligations of the contract. This accounting treatment was consistent with GAAP. For all contracts entered into or modified after January 1, 2003, the Company has recognized prospectively, and will continue to recognize, vendor allowances when the
related merchandise is sold. Net earnings in 2002 were not affected by the adoption of Issue No. 02-16. Adoption of the Issue resulted in a $28 pre-tax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002. This expense was offset by a corresponding
$28 pre-tax LIFO credit that also was included in merchandise costs in 2002.

The Company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry. The Company’s approach is to include in the “Merchandise costs” line item the
direct, net costs of acquiring products and making them

available to customers in its stores. The Company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold, and is consistent with
recently issued accounting standards on the topic.

Advertising Costs

The Company’s
advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred and are included in the “Merchandise costs” line item of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company’s pre-tax advertising costs, excluding
vendor allowances for co-operative advertising, totaled $527 in 2003, $510 in 2002 and $570 in 2001.

In accordance with EITF Issue No. 02-16, for all contracts entered or modified after January 1, 2003, the Company has recognized prospectively, and will
continue to recognize, vendor allowances, including allowances received for co-operative advertising, when the related merchandise is sold.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less to be temporary cash investments. Book overdrafts, which are included in accounts payable, represent disbursements that are funded as the item is presented for payment. Book overdrafts totaled $587 and $480 as of January 31,
2004, and February 1, 2003, respectively.

Segments

The Company operates retail food and drug stores,
multi-department stores, jewelry stores, and convenience stores in the Midwest, South and West. The Company’s retail operations, which represent approximately 99% of consolidated sales, are its only reportable segment. All of the Company’s
operations are domestic.

The Company is continuing the process of implementing its integration plan related to recent mergers. There were no merger-related costs incurred in 2003.
Pre-tax, merger-related costs totaled $1 and $4 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. All of the costs in 2002 and 2001 resulted from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments. Restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in
2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the Fred Meyer merger. All synergy-based awards were earned provided that recipients were still employed on the stated restriction lapsing date.

The following table shows the changes in accruals related to business
combinations:

The $64 liability for
facility closure costs primarily represents the present value of lease obligations remaining through 2019 for locations closed in California prior to the Fred Meyer merger. The $15 liability relates to a charitable contribution required as a result
of the Fred Meyer merger. The Company is required to make this contribution by May 2006.

TEMS

In accordance with its policy on impairment of long-lived assets, the
Company identified impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during 2003 and 2001. These losses, which are reflected in Consolidated Statements of Earnings as “Asset impairment charges,” totaled
$120 and $91, pre-tax, in 2003 and 2001, respectively. In both years, the impairment reviews were conducted as a consequence of a corporate-level strategic plan that coordinated the closings of several locations over a relatively short period of
time. The 2001 charge related to investments by acquired companies in stores opened shortly after the Fred Meyer merger that did not perform as expected during 2000 and 2001. Based on those results and forecasts for 2002 and beyond, the Company
performed an impairment review in the third quarter of 2001 that resulted in a pre-tax charge of $91. The 2003 charge related to locations whose operating performance deteriorated subsequent to the 2001 review. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the
Company authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on results for 2002 and 2003, as well as updated projections for 2004 and beyond. This event triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several
other under-performing locations in the fourth quarter of 2003. The review resulted in a pre-tax charge totaling $120. These charges are more fully described below. No corporate-level asset impairment charges were recorded in 2002.

Assets to be Disposed of

The impairment charges for assets to be disposed of related primarily to the
carrying values of land, buildings, equipment and leasehold improvements for stores that have closed or have been approved for closure. The impairment charges were determined by estimating the fair values of the locations, less costs of disposal.
Fair values were based on third party offers to purchase the assets, or market value for comparable properties, if available. As a result, pre-tax impairment charges related to assets to be disposed of were recognized, reducing the carrying value of
fixed assets by $54 in 2003 and $37 in 2001.

Assets to be
Held and Used

The impairment charges for assets to be
held and used related primarily to the carrying values of land, buildings, equipment and leasehold improvements for stores that will continue to be operated by the Company. Updated projections, based on revised operating plans, were used, on a gross
basis, to determine whether the assets were impaired. Then, discounted cash flows were used to estimate the fair value of the assets for purposes of measuring the impairment charge. As a result, impairment charges related to assets to be held and
used were recognized, reducing the carrying value of fixed assets by $66 in 2003 and $54 in 2001.

Related Items: Lease Liabilities – Store Closing Plans

In connection with the 2001 asset impairment review described above, the Company recorded pre-tax operating, general and
administrative expenses of $20 in 2001 for the present value of lease liabilities for stores identified for closure. In 2000, the Company also recorded pre-tax expenses $67 for the present value of lease liabilities for similar store closings. The
2000 liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the Fred Meyer merger, or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger, that were identified as under-performing stores. In both
years, liabilities were recorded for the planned closings of the stores.

Due to operational changes, performance improved at five stores that had not yet closed. As a result of this improved performance, in the first quarter of 2003 the Company modified its original plans and determined
that these five locations will remain open. Additionally, closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated. In total, in the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax income of $10
to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through 2020 at the locations remaining under the plans. The following table summarizes the changes in the balances of the liabilities:

No charges were recorded in 2003 for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the
2003 asset impairment review. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, such liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed. Most of the locations are
expected to close during 2004. As a result, the Company expects to record pre-tax charges totaling approximately $25 to $32 during 2004.

Sales at Stores Approved for Closure

Sales at the stores remaining under the 2001 and 2000 closing plans totaled $65, $92 and $150 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. With respect to the
2003 plan, sales at stores that have closed or have been approved for closure totaled $433, $437 and $435 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net operating income or loss for these stores cannot be determined on a separately identifiable basis in
accordance with GAAP.

HARGES

On December 11, 2001, the Company outlined the Strategic Growth Plan (“Plan”) to support additional investment in its core business to increase
sales and market share. The Plan had three key elements: reduction of operating, general and administrative expenses, increased coordination of merchandising and procurement activities, and targeted retail price reductions. In the fourth quarter of
2001, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $37 primarily for severance agreements associated with the Plan. Restructuring charges related to the Plan totaled $15, pre-tax, in 2002. The majority of the 2002 expenses related to
severance agreements, distribution center consolidation and conversion costs. No restructuring charges related to the Plan were incurred in 2003.

The following table summarizes the changes in the balances of the liabilities associated with the Plan:

All severance
agreements associated with these liabilities have been paid. The remaining $5 of liabilities represent long-term obligations, including lease commitments through 2009 related to the consolidation of the Company’s Nashville division office.

As described in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on February 3, 2002. The transitional impairment review required by SFAS No. 142 resulted in a
$26 pre-tax non-cash loss to write off the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value. Impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division’s projected future cash
flows on a discounted basis, rather than on an undiscounted basis, as was the standard under SFAS No. 121, prior to adoption of SFAS No. 142. This loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of a $10 tax benefit, in the
first quarter of 2002. No impairment resulted from the Company’s annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2002.

The annual evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2003 resulted in a $444 non-cash impairment charge related to the goodwill at the
Company’s Smith’s division. This impairment charge, which is non-deductible for income tax purposes, adjusted the carrying value of the division’s goodwill to its implied fair value. In 2003, the Smith’s division experienced a
substantial decline in operating performance when compared to prior year results and budgeted 2003 results. Additionally, the Company has forecasted a further decline in the future operating performance of this division. The decline in expected
performance reflects both investments in capital and targeted retail price reductions intended to maintain and grow market share and provide acceptable long-term return on capital. No impairment was indicated during this review for goodwill at other
Company divisions.

The following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s net goodwill balance during 2003 and 2002:

The following table

NCOME

The provision for taxes based on income consists of:

A reconciliation of
the statutory federal rate and the effective rate follows:

The tax effects of significant temporary differences that comprise tax balances were as follows:

At January 31, 2004,
the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $310 that expire from 2010 through 2018. In addition, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $474 that expire from 2009
through 2023. The utilization of certain of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in a given year.

The Company’s valuation allowance pertains to a Ralphs Grocery Co., pre-acquisition federal tax controversy. Any tax benefits subsequently recognized
would be applied to reduce goodwill. Conversely, any additional tax resulting from the controversy and interest incurred up to the date of acquisition would increase goodwill. The cash flow impact of an adverse decision would be approximately $184
as of January 31, 2004.

At January 31, 2004, the Company had
state Alternative Minimum Tax Credit carryforwards of $5. In addition, the Company had other state credits of $21, which expire from 2004 through 2013. The utilization of certain of the Company’s credits may be limited in a given year.

The amounts of cash paid for income taxes in 2003, 2002 and
2001 were reduced by approximately $130, $106 and $22 respectively, as a result of federal bonus depreciation. This provision is scheduled to expire in December 2004 and the Company expects the related cash benefit will begin to reverse in 2005.

BLIGATIONS

Long-term debt consists of:

As of January 31,
2004, the Company had an $812.5 Five-Year Credit Agreement, a $700 Five-Year Credit Agreement and a $1,000 364-Day Credit Agreement. The $812.5 five-year facility terminates on May 23, 2006, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company. The
$700 five-year facility terminates on May 22, 2007, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company. The 364-Day facility terminates on May 20, 2004, unless extended, converted into a one-year term loan, or earlier terminated by the Company.
Borrowings under these credit agreements bear interest at the option of the Company at a rate equal to either (i) the highest, from time to time of (A) the base rate of Citibank, N.A., (B) ½% over a moving average of secondary market morning
offering rates for three-month certificates of deposit adjusted for reserve requirements, and (C) ½% over the federal funds rate or (ii) an adjusted Eurodollar rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (“Eurodollar Rate”) plus
an Applicable Margin. In addition, the Company pays a Facility Fee in connection with these credit agreements. Both the Applicable Margin and the Facility Fee vary based upon the Company’s achievement of a financial ratio or credit rating. At
January 31, 2004, the Applicable Margin for the 364-Day facility was .525% and for the five-year facilities was .500%. The Facility Fee for the 364-Day facility was .100% and for the five-year facilities was .125%. The credit agreements contain
covenants, which, among other things, require the maintenance of certain financial ratios, including fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios. The Company may prepay the credit agreements in whole or in parts, at any time, without a prepayment
penalty. The weighted average interest rate on the amounts outstanding under the credit agreements was 1.13% and 1.81% at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively.

At January 31, 2004, the Company also maintained a $75 money market line. In addition to credit agreement borrowings,
borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the Company’s credit agreements. At January 31, 2004, these letters of credit totaled $227. The Company had no borrowings under the money
market line at January 31, 2004. The Company’s credit agreement borrowings have been classified as long-term borrowings because the Company expects that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of securities. The Company has the
ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis, and has presented the amounts accordingly. The money market line borrowings allow the Company to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered
under the Company’s credit agreements.

At January 31,
2004, the Company also had a $100 pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the $2,512.5 described above. Funds received under this $100 facility do not reduce funds available under the Credit Facilities.
Collection rights to some of the Company’s pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility. As of January 31, 2004, the Company had no borrowings under this additional $100 facility.

All of the Company’s outstanding public debt is subject
to early redemption at varying times and premiums, at the option of the Company. In addition, subject to certain conditions, some of the Company’s publicly issued debt will be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the option of the
holder upon the occurrence of a redemption event, upon not less than five days’ notice prior to the date of redemption, at a redemption price equal to the default amount, plus a specified premium. “Redemption Event” is defined in the
indentures as the occurrence of (i) any person or group, together with any affiliate thereof, beneficially owning 50% or more of the voting power of the Company or (ii) any one person or group, or affiliate thereof, succeeding in having a majority
of its nominees elected to the Company’s Board of Directors, in each case, without the consent of a majority of the continuing directors of the Company.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company historically has used derivatives to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The interest differential to be paid or received is
accrued as interest expense. SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, defines derivatives, requires that derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet, and provides for hedge
accounting when certain conditions are met. In accordance with this standard, the Company’s derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as
“cash flow” hedges, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of related tax effects. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, if any, are recognized in current period earnings. Other
comprehensive income or loss is reclassified into current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with corresponding changes in the fair
values of the hedged assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings.

The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives used as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flow of the
hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or ceases to be highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.

The Company’s current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate
debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, the Company uses the following guidelines: (i) use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts
subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leverage products, and (iv) hedge without
regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status.

Annually, the Company reviews with the Financial Policy Committee of the Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines. In addition, the Company’s internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on
at least an annual basis. These guidelines may change as the Company’s needs dictate.

The table below summarizes the outstanding interest rate swaps designated as hedges as of January 31, 2004, and February 1, 2003. The variable component of each interest rate swap outstanding at January 31, 2004, was
based on LIBOR as of January 31, 2004. The variable component of each interest rate swap outstanding at February 1, 2003, was based on LIBOR as of February 1, 2003.

The Company enters into purchase commitments
for various resources, including raw materials utilized in its manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in its stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. The Company enters into commitments expecting to take delivery of and
to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which the Company expects to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales.
Any commitments for which the Company does not expect to take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instrument for which it was practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and Temporary Cash Investments, Receivables, Prepaid and Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Salaries and Wages and Other Current Liabilities

The carrying amounts of these items approximated fair value.

Long-term Investments

The fair values of these investments were estimated based on quoted market
prices for those or similar investments.

Long-term Debt

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt,
including the current portion thereof, was estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issues. If quoted market prices were not available, the fair value was based on the net present value of future cash flows using the
forward interest rate yield curve in effect at the respective year-ends. The carrying values of long-term debt outstanding under the Company’s credit agreements, approximated fair value.

Interest Rate Protection Agreements

The fair value of these agreements was based on the net present value of the
future cash flows using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at the respective year-ends.

Commodity Price Protection

At February 1, 2003, the Company was party to certain energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of its expected demand for
electricity. The fair value of the excess energy purchase commitments was based on the net present value of future cash flows using forward market prices for electricity in California in effect at February 1, 2003. In July 2003, the Company reached
an agreement through which it ended supply arrangements in California with Dynegy, Inc. related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for as normal purchases normal sales contracts. The Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission approved the agreement on July 23, 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company paid $107, before the related tax benefits, to settle disputes related to prior over-payments, terminate two of the four contracts
effective July 6, 2003, and terminate the remaining two agreements effective September 1, 2003. As a result of the settlement, the Company recorded $62 of pre-tax expense in the second quarter of 2003.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as
follows:

(1)

Excludes capital lease obligations

(2)

During 2003, the Company terminated six interest rate swap agreements that
were accounted for as fair value hedges. Approximately $114 of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the
debt. As of January 31, 2004, the

unamortized balances totaled approximately $98. The Company also initiated 10 new interest rate swap agreements during 2003 that are being accounted for as
fair value hedges. As of January 31, 2004, assets totaling $6 were recorded to reflect the fair value of these new agreements, offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt.

The use of different assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a
material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company actually could realize. In addition, the Company is not subjected to a concentration of
credit risk related to these instruments.

The investments for
which it was not practicable to estimate fair value related primarily to investments, at cost, in an online business-to-business retail exchange. The investment in the retail exchange is evaluated for impairment based on the retail exchange’s
business plan.

EASES

The Company operates primarily in leased facilities. Lease terms generally range from 10 to 20 years with options to renew for varying terms. Terms of
certain leases include escalation clauses, percentage rents based on sales, or payment of executory costs such as property taxes, utilities, or insurance and maintenance. Rent expense for leases with escalation clauses, capital improvement funding
and other lease concessions is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. Portions of certain properties are subleased to others for periods generally ranging from one to 20 years.

Rent expense (under operating leases) consists of:

Minimum annual rentals

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock option plans. All awards become immediately exercisable upon certain changes of control of the Company.

The Company grants options for common stock to employees under various plans, as well as to its non-employee directors, at an option price equal to the
fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. In addition to cash payments, the plans generally provide for the exercise of options by exchanging issued shares of stock of the Company. At January 31, 2004, approximately 13.8 shares of common
stock were available for future options under these plans. Options generally will expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options vest in one year to five years from the date of grant or, for certain options, the earlier of the Company’s stock
reaching certain pre-determined market prices or nine years and six months from the date of grant.

In addition to the stock options described above, the Company also awards restricted stock to employees under various plans. The restrictions on these
awards generally lapse in one year to five years from the date of the awards and expense is recognized over the lapsing cycle. The Company generally records expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the
underlying stock on the date of award. For approximately 1.0 shares of restricted stock that vested based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the Fred Meyer merger, the Company recorded expense in an amount equal to
the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date the synergy goals were achieved. The Company issued approximately 0.7, 1.1 and 0.4 shares of restricted stock in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of January 31, 2004, approximately 0.3
shares of common stock were available for future restricted stock awards. Compensation expense included in net earnings for restricted stock awards totaled approximately $8, $6 and $8, after-tax, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Grants in 2003 were unusually low and, conversely, grants in 2002 were unusually high, due primarily to a general grant of approximately 3.8 stock options
to management and support employees, and approximately 3.9 options to executives including senior officers and division presidents, that was approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors on December 12, 2002 (fiscal 2002). This
grant replaced a planned grant in May 2003 and was accelerated to secure the continued alignment of employee interests with those of the shareholders as strategic plans are implemented. The Committee also made awards of restricted stock to senior
officers and division presidents in recognition of their vital role in a challenging operating environment. The restrictions on these shares will lapse after three years, assuming the recipients’ continued employment with the Company during
that period.

The Company continuously evaluates contingencies based upon the best available evidence.

The Company believes that allowances for loss have been provided to the
extent necessary and that its assessment of contingencies is reasonable. To the extent that resolution of contingencies results in amounts that vary from the Company’s estimates, future earnings will be charged or credited.

The principal contingencies are described below:

Insurance

— The Company’s workers’ compensation risks
are self-insured in certain states. In addition, other workers’ compensation risks and certain levels of insured general liability risks are based on retrospective premium plans, deductible plans, and self-insured retention plans. The liability
for workers’ compensation risks is accounted for on a present value basis. Actual claim settlements and expenses incident thereto may differ from the provisions for loss. Property risks have been underwritten by a subsidiary and are reinsured
with unrelated insurance companies. Operating divisions and subsidiaries have paid premiums, and the insurance subsidiary has provided loss allowances, based upon actuarially determined estimates.

Litigation

— The Company is involved in various legal actions
arising in the normal course of business. Although occasional adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results
of operations of the Company.

Purchase Commitment –

In 2003, the Company reached an agreement to settle litigation with respect to its former interest in and product supply arrangement with Santee Dairies, Inc. (Santee). The Company sold its 50% interest in the Santee and received a release from
past claims against the Company, as well as a reduction in its purchase commitments to Santee.

Guarantees –

The Company periodically enters into real estate joint ventures in connection with the development of certain properties. The Company usually sells its interests in such partnerships upon
completion of the projects. As of January 31, 2004, the Company was a partner with 50% ownership in two real estate joint ventures for which it has guaranteed approximately $7 of debt incurred by the ventures. Based on the covenants underlying this
indebtedness as of January 31, 2004, it is unlikely that the Company will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. The Company has also guaranteed approximately $5 of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership. The Company
believes that it is reasonably possible that the Company will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in 2012.

Assignments –

The Company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility
closings and dispositions. The Company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of the Company’s assignments among third
parties, and various other remedies available, the Company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote.

On February 28, 1986, the Company adopted a warrant dividend plan providing for stock purchase rights to owners of the Company’s common stock. The
plan was amended and restated as of April 4, 1997, and further amended on October 18, 1998. Each share of common stock currently has attached one-fourth of a right. Each right, when exercisable, entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one
ten-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Shares, par value $100 per share, at $87.50 per one ten-thousandth of a share. The rights will become exercisable, and separately tradable, 10 business days following a tender offer or exchange offer
resulting in a person or group having beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the Company’s common stock. In the event the rights become exercisable and thereafter the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination, each right
will entitle the holder to purchase common stock of the surviving corporation, for the exercise price, having a market value of twice the exercise price of the right. Under certain other circumstances, including certain acquisitions of the Company
in a merger or other business combination transaction, or if 50% or more of the Company’s assets or earnings power are sold under certain circumstances, each right will entitle the holder to receive upon payment of the exercise price, shares of
common stock of the acquiring company with a market value of two times the exercise price. At the Company’s option, the rights, prior to becoming exercisable, are redeemable in their entirety at a price of $0.01 per right. The rights are
subject to adjustment and expire March 19, 2006.

The Company has authorized 5 shares of voting cumulative preferred stock; 2 were available for issuance at January 31, 2004. Fifty thousand shares have
been designated as “Series A Preferred Shares” and are reserved for issuance under the Company’s warrant dividend plan. The stock has a par value of $100 and is issuable in series.

Common Stock

The Company has authorized 1,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value per
share. On May 20, 1999, the shareholders authorized an amendment to the Amended Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 1,000 to 2,000 when the Board of Directors determines it to be in the best interest of
the Company.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

In December of 1999, the Company began a program to
repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit. On March 1, 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of an
incremental $1,000 of Kroger common stock. During fiscal 2001, the Company made open market purchases of $343 under the $1,000 authorization and $209 under previous Board authorizations. During fiscal 2002, the Company made open market purchases of
approximately $657 to complete the $1,000 program. Effective December 10, 2002, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling $500. The Company made open market purchases of $277 and $63 under this plan in fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively. As of April 9, 2004, the Company has repurchased approximately $103 under this plan in fiscal 2004. The Company also reacquired approximately $24, $65 and $180 under the stock option program in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Purchases of stock under the Board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital.

The Company administers non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans for substantially all non-union employees and some union-represented employees
as determined by the terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements. Funding for the pension plans is based on a review of the specific requirements and on evaluation of the assets and liabilities of each plan.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
health care benefits for retired employees. The majority of the Company’s employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach normal retirement age while employed by the Company. Funding of retiree health care benefits occurs as
claims or premiums are paid.

Information with respect to
change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, net amounts recognized at end of fiscal years, weighted average assumptions and components of net periodic benefit cost follow:

Pension plan assets
include $134 and $109 of common stock of The Kroger Co. at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively. The plan owned 7.3 million shares of The Kroger Co. common stock at January 31, 2004, unchanged from February 1, 2003.

To determine the
expected return on pension plan assets, the Company contemplates current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories. The average annual return on pension plan assets for the 10
calendar years ended December 31, 2003, was 9.6%, net of all fees and expenses. The Company reduced the pension return assumption to 8.5% for 2003 from 9.5% in 2002. The Company believes the reduction in the pension return assumption was appropriate
because future returns are not expected to achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return. For measurement purposes, a 10% initial annual rate of increase, and a 5% ultimate annual rate of increase, in the per capita
cost of other benefits, were assumed for pre-retirement age personnel in 2003 and 2002.

The following table provides the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”), accumulated benefit
obligation (“ABO”) and the fair value of plan assets for all company-sponsored pension plans. As of year-end 2003, the PBO, ABO and fair value of plan assets related to the nonqualified, excess retirement benefit plan (“Nonqualified
Plan”) were $78, $72 and $0, respectively. The Nonqualified Plan is not funded because of unfavorable tax treatment that would be received if it were funded.

The following table
provides information about the target and actual pension plan asset allocations. Allocation percentages are shown as of December 31 for each respective year. The pension plan measurement date is the December 31

st

nearest the fiscal year-end.

Investment objectives,
policies and strategies are set by the Pension Investment Committee (the “Committee”) appointed by the CEO. The primary objectives include holding, protecting and investing the assets and distributing benefits to participants and
beneficiaries of the pension plans. Investment objectives have been established based on a comprehensive review of the capital markets and each underlying plan’s current and projected financial requirements. The time horizon of the investment
objectives is long-term in nature and plan assets are managed on a going-concern basis.

Investment objectives and guidelines specifically applicable to each manager of assets are established and reviewed annually. Derivative instruments may be used for specified purposes. Any use of derivative
instruments for a purpose or in a manner not specifically authorized is prohibited, unless approved in advance by the Committee. Common stock of The Kroger Co. is included in plan assets subject to statutory limitations restricting additional
purchases when the fair value of the stock equals or exceeds 10% of plan assets.

The current target allocations shown represent five-year targets that were established in 2002 and intended to be achieved over a five-year period. To maintain actual asset allocations consistent with target
allocations, assets are reallocated or rebalanced on a regular basis. Cash flow from employer contributions and participant benefit payments is used to fund underweight asset classes and divest overweight asset classes, as appropriate. The Company
expects that cash flow will be sufficient to meet most rebalancing needs. On February 18, 2003, the Company made a cash contribution of $100 to its pension plans. The Company is required to make a cash contribution of $34 by September 15, 2004, and
intends to contribute an additional $149 by September 15, 2004. The Company expects the additional contributions made during 2004 will reduce its minimum required contributions in future years. Among other things, performance of plan assets, the
interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

The Company
participates in various multi-employer plans for substantially all employees represented by unions. The Company is required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense for these
plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits are generally based upon a fixed amount for each year of service. The

Company contributed $169, $153, and $114 to these funds in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company would have contributed an additional $13 to
these plans in 2003 had there been no labor disputes. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe theses plans are underfunded. The decline in the value of assets held in the funds supporting these plans, coupled with the high
level of benefits generally provided, has led to the underfunding. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges.
Two recently completed labor negotiations, including southern California, resulted in a reduction of liabilities (and, therefore, expected contribution increases). These multi-employer funds are managed by trustees, appointed by management of the
employers (including Kroger) and labor in equal number, who have fiduciary obligations to act prudently. Thus, while we expect contributions to these funds to continue to increase as they have in recent years, the amount of increase will depend upon
the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees and the actual return on assets held in these funds. For these reasons, it is not practicable to determine the amount by which the Company’s multi-employer pension contributions
will increase. Moreover, if the Company were to exit markets, it may be required to pay a withdrawal liability. Any adjustments for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated.

The Company also administers certain defined contribution
plans for eligible union and non-union employees. The cost of these plans for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $14, $20 and $19, respectively.

SFAS No. 132, “Employer’s Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits” was revised by the
FASB in December 2003. The revised statement requires new annual disclosures about the types of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations and cash flows as well as components of the net periodic benefit cost recognized in
interim periods. The new annual disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, except for the disclosure of expected future benefit payment, which must be disclosed for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Interim
period disclosures are generally effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. The Company has included the disclosures required by SFAS No. 132 in Note 18.

SFAS No. 143, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” was issued by the FASB in August of 2001. This standard addresses
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 became effective for Kroger on February 2, 2003. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the
Company’s financial statements.

SFAS No. 145,
“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections,” was issued by the FASB in April of 2002. SFAS No. 145 became effective for Kroger on February 2, 2003. This Statement
eliminates the requirement that gains and losses due to the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. Adoption of SFAS No. 145 required the Company to reclassify
the debt extinguishments recorded as extraordinary items in 2002 as interest expense in the respective periods. Theses debt extinguishments were recorded during the first two quarters of 2002 and totaled $19 of pre-tax expense. Pre-tax expense
totaling $18 related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of $100 of long-term bonds, and the write-off of the related deferred financing costs, was recorded in 2003.

FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” was issued by the
FASB in January of 2003 and revised in December 2003. FIN 46 provides guidance relating to the identification of, and financial reporting for, variable-interest entities, as defined in the Interpretation. FIN 46 is effective for all
variable-interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For any variable-interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003, FIN 46 became effective on February 1, 2004, the beginning of the Company’s first quarter of 2004, unless earlier
adopted, except for entities designated as special purpose entities for which the effective date was the fourth quarter of 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46 for a mortgagor (the “Mortgagor”) of certain of the
Company’s properties. In prior years, the Company had purchased a portion of the debt issued by the Mortgagor to reduce the Company’s effective interest expense. These purchases were classified as investments in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Consolidation of the Mortgagor reduced both the Company’s investments and total debt by approximately $65. Consolidation of the Mortgagor had an immaterial effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company continues to review its partnerships, joint ventures and other financing arrangements for potential consolidation under this Interpretation. If the Company is required to consolidate
any other entities in the first quarter of 2004, the Company anticipates that such consolidation will have an immaterial effect on its financial statements.

EITF Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” was issued in
November 2003. EITF Issue No. 03-10 addresses the accounting for manufacturer sales incentives offered directly to consumers, including manufacturer coupons. EITF Issue No. 03-10 became effective for the Company on February 1, 2004, the beginning of
its first quarter of 2004. The Company believes the adoption of EITF Issue No. 03-10 will have an immaterial effect on its financial statements.

SFAS No 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” was issued by the FASB in January 2004. SFAS No. 106-1 allows for a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization act of 2003
(“Prescription Drug Act”). The Prescription Drug Act, which was signed into law in December 2003, in addition to creating a federal prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans which provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The Prescription Drug Act introduces two new programs to Medicare, a subsidy to plan sponsors based on 28% of an individual
beneficiary’s annual prescription drug costs between $250 and $5,000 and an option for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefit under Medicare, that must be taken into consideration when measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit.
SFAS No. 106-1 does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effect of the Prescription Drug Act in its financial statements.

The Company has elected to defer adoption of SFAS No. 106-1 due to a lack of specific guidance. As such, the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed
in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect the impact on the plans of the Prescription Drug Act. Until further specific guidance is provided, the Company will continue to
defer adoption of SFAS No. 106-1. Authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and, when issued, may require information previously reported in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements to change. The
Company will continue to investigate the impact of SFAS No. 106-1 initial recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not expect adoption of SFAS No. 106-1 will have a material
effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

UBSIDIARIES

The Company’s outstanding public debt (the “Guaranteed Notes”) is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger
Co. and some of its subsidiaries (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”). At January 31, 2004, a total of approximately $6.8 billion of Guaranteed Notes were outstanding. The Guarantor Subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of The Kroger Co. Separate financial statements of The Kroger Co. and each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are not presented because the guarantees are full and unconditional and the Guarantor Subsidiaries are jointly and severally
liable. The Company believes that separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the Guarantor Subsidiaries would not be material to investors.

The non-guaranteeing subsidiaries represent less than 3% on an individual and aggregate basis of consolidated assets, pretax earnings, cash flow, and
equity for all periods presented, except for consolidated pre-tax earnings in 2003. Therefore, the non-guarantor subsidiaries’ information is not separately presented in the balance sheets and the statements of cash flows, but rather is
included in the column labeled “Guarantor Subsidiaries,” for those periods. The non-guaranteeing subsidiaries represented approximately 4% of 2003 consolidated pre-tax earnings. Therefore, the non-guarantor subsidiaries information is
separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for 2003. The non-guaranteeing subsidiaries represented less than 3% on an individual and aggregate basis of consolidated pre-tax earnings in 2002 and 2001. Therefore, the
non-guarantor subsidiaries’ information is not separately presented for those periods, but rather is included in the column labeled “Guarantor Subsidiaries.”

There are no current restrictions on the ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to make payments under the guarantees
referred to above, except, however, the obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee are limited to the maximum amount as will result in obligations of such guarantor under its guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, or any similar Federal or state law (e.g., adequate capital to pay dividends under corporate laws).

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of January 31, 2004, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, together with a disclosure review committee appointed by the Chief Executive Officer,
evaluated Kroger’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, Kroger’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Kroger’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31,
2004.

In connection with the evaluation described above, there was no change
in Kroger’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2004, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Kroger’s internal control over financial reporting.
