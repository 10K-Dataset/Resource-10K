Strategy

Tyco's operating strategy is to be a high-quality, low-cost producer and provider in each of the markets we serve. We promote our
leadership positions by investing in existing businesses and developing new markets. Our current business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco
businesses, and we plan to achieve this goal primarily through new product innovation, increased market share, increasing the service and repair components of our existing businesses and continued
geographic expansion. We have implemented and will continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments to achieve best-in-class operating practices. We strive to
increase the value of our Company and our global portfolio of diversified brands by exceeding customers' expectations and by achieving market leadership and operating excellence in every segment.
Leveraging the strengths of our existing operations, we seek to enhance value for our shareholders through operational excellence and maximization of cash flows. Additionally, we have strengthened our
balance sheet by using our strong cash flow to reduce debt. We are also continuing to pursue the disposition of certain non-core businesses and may consider an appropriate acquisition
should the opportunity arise. We are committed to being a leader in corporate governance so that we can continue to earn the respect and confidence of our shareholders, employees, suppliers and
customers as well as the financial community.

Operating Segments

See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain segment and geographic financial data relating to our business.

I.    Fire and Security

Tyco is the world's leading provider of both electronic security services and fire protection services. With 2004 net revenue of $11.5 billion, our Fire
and Security businesses currently comprise 29% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2003 and 2002, net revenue totaled $10.9 billion or 30% of our consolidated net revenue and
$10.2 billion or 29% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. The group's products and services include:

•

designing,
manufacturing, installing, monitoring and servicing electronic security systems;


•

designing,
manufacturing, installing and servicing a broad line of fire detection systems and suppression systems, and manufacturing and servicing fire extinguishers and
related products; and

•

providing
integrated systems for surveillance and control of public transportation systems, bridges, tunnels and other public works.

Tyco
Fire and Security consists of two reporting units: Electronic Security Services and Fire Protection Contracting and Services.

Electronic Security Services

We are the world's leading provider of electronic security products and services and event monitoring, which includes the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire
alarms, medical alert systems, such as our Personal Emergency Response Systems, and other activities where around-the-clock monitoring and response are required. We offer
regular inspection and maintenance services to ensure that systems will function properly and can be upgraded as technology or risk profiles change. We are also a leading supplier of electronic
security solutions to the retail, commercial and industrial marketplaces, offering anti-theft, video surveillance,
access control, electronic asset protection and security management systems, products and services. These and other security services are provided principally through our ADT operating companies.

Electronically
monitored security systems are tailored to our customers' specific needs and involve the installation and use on a customer's premises of devices designed for intrusion
detection and access control, as well as reaction to various occurrences or conditions, such as movement, fire, smoke, flooding, environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These
detection devices are connected to microprocessor-based control panels, which communicate to a monitoring center (located remotely from the customer's premises) where alarm and supervisory signals are
received and recorded. In most systems, control panels can identify the nature of the alarm and the areas within a building where the sensor was activated. Depending upon the type of service for which
the subscriber has contracted, monitoring center personnel respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to the local fire or police departments, notifying the customer or taking other
appropriate action, such as dispatching employees to the customer's premises. In some instances, the customer may monitor the system at its own premises or the system may be connected to local fire or
police departments.

Whether
systems are monitored by the customer at its premises or connected to one of our monitoring centers, we usually provide support and maintenance through service contracts. Systems
installed at customers' premises may be owned by us or by our customers.

We
market our electronic security services to commercial and residential customers through both a direct sales force and an authorized dealer network. A separate national accounts sales
force services large commercial customers. We also utilize advertising and direct mail to market our services.

We
provide residential electronic security services primarily in North America, Europe and South Africa, with a growing presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Our commercial
customers include financial institutions, industrial and commercial businesses, federal, state and local governments, defense installations, and health care and educational facilities. Our customers
are often prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that a system be installed as a
condition to coverage. It has been our experience that the majority of commercial and residential monitoring contracts are renewed after their initial terms. In general, relocations account for the
largest number of residential discontinuances while business closures comprise the largest single factor impacting commercial contract attrition.

We
are the leader in anti-theft systems. The majority of the world's leading retailers use our systems to protect against shoplifting and employee theft. We manufacture these
SENSORMATIC electronic article surveillance systems and generally sell them through our direct sales force in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and South Africa. A growing trend in the
loss protection


industry
is for security labels to be applied to goods at the point of manufacture. In most cases, we sell these labels directly to the manufacturers or their packaging agents. We also develop and
distribute access control and video surveillance systems, which are sold through direct and distributor channels.

We
manufacture certain alarm, detection and activation devices and central monitoring station equipment both for installation by us and for sale to other installers, although we
outsource some of the electronic components we install.

The
security business in North America is highly competitive, with a number of major firms and some 12,000 smaller regional and local companies. Similarly, Tyco competes with several
national companies and several thousand regional and local companies in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and South Africa. Competition is based primarily on price in relation
to quality of service. We believe that the quality of our electronic security service is higher than that of many of our competitors and, therefore, our prices may be higher than those charged by our
competitors.

Fire Protection Contracting and Services

We design, fabricate, install and service automatic fire sprinkler systems, fire alarm and detection systems and special hazard suppression systems in buildings,
industrial plants and off-shore installations, as well as respiratory systems and other life-saving devices. Tyco's fire protection businesses utilize a worldwide network of
sales offices, operating globally under various trade names including SIMPLEXGRINNELL, WORMALD, MATHER & PLATT, TOTAL WALTHER, DONG BANG, ZETTLER, ANSUL, SCOTT and TYCO.

We
install fire protection systems in both new and existing buildings. Our fire protection systems are purchased by owners, construction engineers and mechanical or general contractors.
In recent years, the retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire protection systems, especially in hotels, healthcare facilities,
educational establishments and other buildings accessible to the general public. We continue to focus on system maintenance and inspection, which have become more significant parts of our business.

The
majority of the fire suppression systems installed by Tyco are water-based. However, we are also the world's leading provider of custom designed special hazard fire protection
systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases, in addition to spill control products designed to absorb, neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous
materials. These systems are often especially suited to fire protection in certain manufacturing, power generation, petrochemical, offshore oil exploration, transportation, data processing,
telecommunications, commercial food preparation, mining and marine applications.

We
manufacture and distribute SCOTT and SABRE breathing systems for use by firefighters and other first responders and for industrial applications. Military forces from 25 countries use
our breathing apparatus and more than half a million U.S. firefighters rely on our SCOTT AIR-PAKR brand of self-contained breathing apparatus. SCOTT and SABRE products are sold
globally through a network of distributors. SCOTT is considered the world leader in respiratory protection innovation for first responders.

In
Asia, and to a lesser extent in Europe, Tyco designs, installs and maintains integrated systems which monitor and manage urban traffic control systems, as well as lighting,
ventilation, fire detection, surveillance and traffic control for bridges, tunnels, railways and mines.

The
majority of the mechanical components (and, in North America, a high proportion of the pipe) used in our fire protection systems are manufactured by Tyco Engineered Products and
Services. We use computer-aided-design technology that reduces the time required to design systems for specific applications and coordinates the fabrication and delivery of system components. We also
have fabrication plants that cut, thread and weld pipe, which is then shipped with other prefabricated components to job sites for installation.


Competition
in the fire protection contracting business varies by region. In North America, Tyco competes with hundreds of smaller contractors on a regional or local basis for the
installation of fire protection, alarm and detection systems. In Europe, Tyco competes with many regional or local contractors on a country-by-country basis. In Australia, New
Zealand and Asia, we compete with a few large fire protection contractors, as well as with many smaller regional or local companies. Tyco competes for fire protection systems contracts primarily on
the basis of price, service and quality.

II.    Electronics

Tyco is the world's leading supplier of passive electronic components. With 2004 net revenue of $11.8 billion, our Electronics businesses currently
comprise 29% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2003 and 2002, net revenue totaled $10.5 billion or 29% of our consolidated net revenue and $10.6 billion or 31% of our consolidated net
revenue, respectively. The group's products and services include:

connectors and assemblies, cable and cabling systems, and related application tools and application tooling equipment. Products are sold under the AMP, AGASTAT, AXICOM, AUGAT, BUCHANAN, CRITCHLEY,
DULMISON, ELO-TOUCH SYSTEMS, M/A-COM, POTTER & BRUMFIELD, RAYCHEM, SCHRACK and TYCO ELECTRONICS trade names, among others.

Sales
and marketing are done via direct sales and distributors to customers including original equipment manufacturers and their subcontractors, utilities, government agencies,
value-added resellers and those who install, maintain and repair equipment. In 2004, the group's direct sales represented 86% of net revenue while the remaining net revenue was via distributors. Their
customers are found in the automotive, communications equipment manufacturing, telecommunications service, computer, aerospace, military, household appliance, industrial machinery and equipment,
instrumentation, consumer electronics, energy and networking industries. In total, these businesses serve over 250,000 customers located in over 55 countries and maintain a strong local presence in
the geographic areas in which they operate, including the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

Tyco
Submarine Telecommunications is a leading provider of undersea fiber optic networks and services. Tyco Submarine Telecommunications' products and services include: designing,
manufacturing and installing undersea cable communications systems and servicing and maintaining major undersea cable networks.

Research and Development

The amounts expended for Tyco-sponsored research and development during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $784 million, $667 million and
$633 million, respectively.

Tyco-sponsored
research and development expense by segment for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows ($ in millions):




Electronics

$

Approximately
5,800 full-time scientists, engineers and other technical personnel were engaged in our product research and development activities as of
September 30, 2004.

Research
activity at Electronics focuses specifically on new product development and a continuous expansion of technical capabilities. Healthcare focuses on technologies to complement
existing product lines and applying expertise to refine and successfully commercialize such products and technologies and on acquiring rights to new products. We anticipate that Healthcare's research
and development spending will continue to increase during 2005. Research activity in Fire and Security relates mostly to the design of fire and intrusion alarm products and emergency alarm systems, as
well as products related to electronic article surveillance. Engineered Products and Services focuses on improvements in hydraulic design, which controls the motion of fluids, resulting in new fire
protection devices and flow
control products. Plastics and Adhesives' research activities consist primarily of new and improved product development.


Raw and Other Purchased Materials

We are a large buyer of steel and resin in the United States. We are also a large buyer of copper, brass, gold, electronic components, chemicals and additives,
thin and flexible copper clad materials, zinc, paper, ink, foil, adhesives, cloth, wax, pulp and cotton. Certain of the components used in the Fire Protection business, principally certain valves and
fittings, are purchased for installation in fire protection systems or for distribution. Materials are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. There have been no
shortages in materials which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. However, significant increases in raw material costs may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins. We
enter into long-term supply contracts, using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions.

Patents and Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, which principally relate to electrical and electronic products, healthcare products, fire protection devices, electronic security
systems, flow control products, tubing, building and cable products, and plastic and adhesive products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks.
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. All capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks
owned by, or licensed to, the Company or its subsidiaries. Although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future, in the opinion of management the loss of any
single patent or trademark would not materially affect the conduct of the business in any of our segments.

Employees

Tyco employed 258,400 people at September 30, 2004, of which 98,000 are employed in the United States and 160,400 are outside the United States. We have
collective bargaining agreements with labor unions covering 43,100 employees at certain of our North American, European and Asia-Pacific businesses. We believe that our relations with the
labor unions are generally good.

In
April 1994, following lengthy contract talks with the Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669, our Grinnell subsidiary declared that negotiations were at an impasse
and implemented its last best and final offer. Employees in those locations, representing 64% of Grinnell Fire Protection's North American union employees at the time (approximately 1,200 employees),
went on strike. In January 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit determined that while Grinnell had acted in good faith, the Company should not have declared an
impasse. The court ordered the reinstatement of the terms of the 1994 collective bargaining agreement, instructed the Company to compensate any employees affected by the Company's decision to declare
an impasse and ordered the parties to return to their negotiations. It was also in January 2001 that Tyco acquired Simplex Time Recorder Co. In January 2002, Grinnell Fire Protection and
Simplex Time Recorder Co. began doing business as SimplexGrinnell LP (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco). As instructed by the court, SimplexGrinnell reinstated relevant terms of the 1994
collective bargaining agreement, made whole any affected employees (approximately 2% of SimplexGrinnell's employee population) and resumed negotiations with Local Union No. 669. Despite the
Company's good faith attempts to continue negotiations, the Union called another strike in September 2003. This strike is ongoing and has not had any material effect on the Company's
operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things, the generation,
storage, use and transportation of


hazardous
materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. The cost of compliance with environmental laws, however, has not had, and
based on current information and applicable laws, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and from state environmental agencies, that conditions
at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the
cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental
contamination resulting from past operations.

The
ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial
costs in the range of approximately $167 million to $443 million. As of September 30, 2004, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately
$265 million, of which $42 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $223 million is included in other long-term liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $265 million, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Securities Class Actions

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco and certain of our former directors and officers have been named as defendants in more than two dozen
securities class actions. Most of the securities class actions have now been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. In eight of the actions, plaintiffs have moved to have their cases remanded to state courts.

On
January 28, 2003, the court-appointed lead plaintiffs in the New Hampshire securities actions filed

In Re Tyco International Securities
Litigation

, a Consolidated Securities Class Action Complaint against certain of our former directors and officers, our former auditors and Tyco in the United States District
Court for the District of New Hampshire. As to Tyco and certain of its former directors and officers, the complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 14(a) of that Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, as well as Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933. Claims against our former directors and officers are also asserted under Sections 20(a) and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933. The complaint asserts that the Tyco defendants violated the securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things,
the following: Tyco's mergers and acquisitions and the accounting therefor, as well as allegedly undisclosed acquisitions; misstatements of Tyco's financial results; the impact of a new accounting
standard (SAB 101, promulgated in 1999) on our earnings performance; compensation of certain of our former executives; their improper use of our funds for personal benefit and their improper
self-dealing real estate transactions; their sales of Tyco shares; payment of $20 million to one of our former directors and a charity of which he is a trustee; and the criminal
investigation of our former Chief Executive Officer. The plaintiffs seek class certification, compensatory damages, rescission, disgorgement and attorneys' fees and expenses.

On
March 31, 2003, Tyco made a motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint. The other defendants moved to dismiss shortly thereafter. On October 14, 2004, the
Court granted Tyco's motion, in part, and denied it in part. The Court granted Tyco's motion to dismiss Count II of the Consolidated Amended Complaint alleging a violation of Section 14(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder against all defendants. The Court denied Tyco's


motion
to dismiss Count I alleging a violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Counts V and VI
alleging violations of Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, the Court granted former director Michael Ashcroft's motion to dismiss Count I alleging a violation of
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, Counts III and IV alleging a violation of Sections 20(a) and 20A of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, respectively, and Count VII alleging a violation of Section 14 of the Securities Act of 1933.

A

Ezra Charitable Trust v. Tyco
International Ltd.,

on May 28, 2003, plaintiff purports to represent a class of purchasers of Tyco securities between December 30, 2002 and
March 12, 2003. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco and Edward D. Breen, Tyco's current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The complaint asserts a cause of action under Section 10(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against both defendants. As against defendant Breen, the complaint asserts a cause of action under
Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that defendants violated the securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions
concerning, among other things, Tyco's financial and operating condition and financial prospects for Tyco and its ADT business segment and the results of its investigation of its former management.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. The Company has moved to dismiss the complaint, which
remains pending before the court.

On
June 3, 2004, an action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles,

Hess v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

Plaintiffs name as additional defendants PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, L. Dennis Koslowski, Mark H. Schwartz, Mark Belnick, Lord
Michael A. Ashcroft, Joshua M. Berman, Richard S. Bodman, John F. Fort, Steven W. Foss, Wendy E. Lane, James S. Passman, W. Peter Slusser and
Joseph F. Welch. Plaintiffs' complaint asserts claims of fraud, negligent representation, aiding and abetting, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with fiduciary relationship and
conspiracy arising out of an underlying settlement of litigation brought by shareholders in Progressive Angioplasty Systems, Inc. where the plaintiffs received Tyco stock as consideration. On
September 27, 2004, the Company entered into a stipulation with the plaintiffs staying the litigation during the pendancy of plaintiffs' National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
arbitration to which Tyco is not a party.

Four
plaintiffs filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in

Wilson v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

on June 3, 2003. Plaintiffs named as defendants Tyco International Ltd., Tyco International (US), Tyco Acquisition Corp. VII and Earth Tech EMS
Holdings Inc., d/b/a Earth Tech. The complaint asserts causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation and exemplary damages. Plaintiffs
allege that during the course of negotiations for the acquisition of two companies by Earth Tech, a division of Tyco, defendants made material misrepresentations to plaintiffs and that after the
contracts of sale had been finalized, breached material terms of the contracts. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants engaged in accounting manipulations that caused significant harm to the two
companies and that, as a result, plaintiffs were denied fair payment for their companies, which lost fair market value. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conditionally transferred this
action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On December 9, 2003, however, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation vacated the conditional transfer order
and remanded this action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

A
class action was filed on July 28, 2003 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

misleading and failed to disclose facts necessary to make the registration statement and prospectus not misleading. Further, the complaint alleges the defendants violated securities laws by making
materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, executive compensation and Tyco's and TyCom's finances and business prospects. On November 10, 2003, the
District Court of New Jersey granted one plaintiff's motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and consolidated the action with

plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. By order dated March 26, 2003, the District Court of New Hampshire assigned the case to the Securities Actions pending before it. As against all
defendants, the amended complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, for common law

estate


transactions;

attorneys' fees and expenses. Defendants removed these four actions from Florida state court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation transferred the actions to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Plaintiffs in these actions have moved to have their cases remanded to the
Florida state court.

plaintiff named as additional defendants Tyco International (US) Inc., L. Dennis
Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and Juergen W. Gromer, currently President of Tyco Electronics. Plaintiff's
complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 11 of the
Securities Act of 1933. Claims against Messrs. Kozlowski, Swartz and Gromer are also asserted under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder and Section 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. Plaintiff also asserts common law

Securities Act of 1972. Tyco has removed the complaint to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this
action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. The plaintiff has moved to vacate the conditional transfer order.


On
September 27, 2004, an amended action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina,

Hall v. Tyco
International Ltd., et. al.

This

pro se

plaintiff names as additional defendants, Tyco International
(US) Inc., Tyco Electronics, AMP, Inc. and The Retirement Committee of Tyco International (US) Inc. Plaintiff's complaint asserts claims of breach of contract and securities
fraud. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has been notified that this may be an action that should be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, numerous actions have been filed purporting to bring suit derivatively on behalf of Tyco against certain former
officers and certain former directors of Tyco and against Tyco as a nominal defendant. Three such actions were pending as of the filing of our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2004, all of which have since been dismissed as discussed below.

On
June 18, 2002, an action,

Shelley Evans v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, et al.,

was filed in the United States District Court for the
District of New Hampshire, alleging that the individually named defendants breached their fiduciary duties and committed waste and mismanagement in connection with the compensation of certain board
members and their use of corporate assets for their own benefit. Plaintiff sought money damages, declaratory relief, and the removal and replacement of the director defendants. The court dismissed
this action in its entirety against all defendants on October 14, 2004.

On
June 21, 2002, an action,

Joan L. Weisberg v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, et al.,

was filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, alleging that the individually named defendants breached their fiduciary duties and committed waste in connection with Tyco's accounting practices, individual board
members' use of funds, and the compensation of certain board members. Plaintiff sought money damages, injunctive relief, and an equitable accounting. Defendants requested that the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation treat this as a related action and transfer the suit to the District of New Hampshire for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. The court dismissed this action in
its entirety against all defendants on October 14, 2004.

On
August 2, 2002, an action,

Paul Manko v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, et al.,

was filed in the United States District Court for the
District of New Hampshire, alleging that the individually-named defendants breached their fiduciary duties and committed waste and mismanagement in connection with Tyco's accounting practices,
individual board members' use of funds, and the Company's financial disclosures. Plaintiffs sought summary damages. The court dismissed this action in its entirety against all defendants on
October 14, 2004.

ERISA Litigation and Investigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco and certain of our current and former employees, officers and directors, have been named as defendants in
eight class actions brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). The complaints purported to bring claims on behalf of the Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement
Savings and Investment Plans ("the Plans") and the participants therein.

Two
of the actions,

Peterson v. Tyco International Ltd.

and

Swanson v. Tyco
International Ltd.

, were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, and the six remaining actions,

Overby v.
Tyco

,

Dunne v. Tyco

,

Jepson v. Tyco

,

Gordon v.
Tyco

,

Konyn v. Tyco

and

Johnson v. Tyco

, were transferred to that Court by the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. All eight actions have been consolidated in the District Court in New Hampshire.

On
February 3, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint,

Overby v. Tyco

, asserting causes of action under ERISA.
That complaint named as defendants Tyco and certain of its


present
and former officers and directors, its wholly-owned subsidiary Tyco International (US) Inc., its retirement committee, and certain of its present and former officers, directors and
employees. The complaint asserts that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by negligently misrepresenting and negligently failing to disclose material information concerning,
among other things, the following: related-party transactions and executive compensation; Tyco's mergers and acquisitions and the accounting therefor, as well as allegedly undisclosed acquisitions;
and misstatements of Tyco's financial results. The complaint also asserts that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Plans to invest in Tyco shares when it was not a prudent
investment. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the defendants are not entitled to protection under ERISA's safe harbor provision; an order compelling the defendants to make good to the Plans all
losses caused by the defendants' alleged breaches of fiduciary duty; imposition of a constructive trust on any amounts by which any defendant was unjustly enriched; an order enjoining future
violations of ERISA; actual damages in the amount of any losses the Plans suffered; costs and attorneys' fees; and an order for equitable restitution and other appropriate equitable monetary relief.

On
April 4, 2003, Tyco and several other defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. Shortly thereafter the other defendants also moved to dismiss. On
November 6, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to add eleven current and former employees as defendants. On December 2, 2004, the United States District Court for the District of New
Hampshire granted Tyco's motion, in part, and denied it in part. The court granted Tyco's motion to dismiss two employee defendants, all former directors of Tyco International Ltd. and the former
officers of Tyco International Ltd., other than the former Chief Executive Officer, as defendants in the case. The court also dismissed Count II asserting negligent misrepresentation claims against
Tyco International Ltd. and its former Chief Executive Officer. The court denied Tyco's motion to dismiss Count I alleging breach of fiduciary duty against Tyco International Ltd., Tyco
International (US) Inc., the Board of Directors of Tyco International (US) Inc., the Tyco (US) Retirement Committee and the former Chief Executive Officer of Tyco International Ltd, as
well as Count II alleging negligent misrepresentation against Tyco International (US) Inc., the Tyco (US) Retirement Committee and the Board of Directors of Tyco International (US) Inc.

In
addition, Tyco and certain of our current and former executives have received requests from the United States Department of Labor for information concerning the administration of the
Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans. The current focus of the Department's inquiry concerns losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in our
shares. The Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on behalf of the Plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the Plans for recovery of losses and additional
penalties, although it has not informed us of any intention to do so.

Tyco Litigation Against Former Senior Management

Tyco International Ltd v. Mark A. Belnick, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No.
02-CV-4644, filed June 17, 2002

. As previously reported in our periodic filings, we have filed a civil complaint against our former Executive
Vice President and Chief Corporate Counsel for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The action alleges that the defendant: solicited and accepted cash and share bonuses without Board
approval; took interest-free loans from our relocation program without Board approval; failed to disclose to the Board and to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") his Retention
Agreement and compensation; failed to advise the Board of the improper conduct of other officers; refused to cooperate with internal investigations; and engaged in other improper conduct. The
complaint asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, inducement to breach fiduciary duty, conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty, fraud and other wrongful conduct and seeks to recover
compensation and profits received from employment at Tyco, repayment of all loans fraudulently procured, with interest, damages for the harm caused to us, and punitive


damages.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

On
October 21, 2002, in a related proceeding, Mark Belnick has commenced an arbitration proceeding in New York County, New York seeking to enforce the terms of an alleged
executive retention agreement with the Company and to recover unspecified damages. The Company has not filed an answer to the statement of claim.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Frank E. Walsh, Jr., United States District Court, Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-4633, filed June 17, 2002

. As previously reported in our periodic filings, we have filed a civil complaint against a former
director for breach of fiduciary duty and related wrongful conduct involving a $20 million payment in connection with a 2001 acquisition by Tyco. The action alleges causes of action for
restitution, breach of fiduciary duty and inducing breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and a constructive trust, and seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a
result of the defendant director's conduct. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco, which was deposited by the Company in January 2003, as
a result of a plea bargain agreement with the New York County District Attorney. Our claims against Mr. Walsh are still pending. Discovery in this action has been stayed as a result of a motion
by the New York County District Attorney's Office. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

Tyco International Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No.
02-CV-7317, filed September 12, 2002, Amended April 1, 2003

. As previously reported in our periodic filings, we have filed a civil
complaint against our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The Company
amended that complaint on April 1, 2003. The amended complaint alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from our Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program; awarded
millions of dollars in unauthorized bonuses to himself and certain other Tyco employees; engaged in improper self-dealing real estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with
certain other former Tyco employees in committing these acts. The amended complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, conversion, a
constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The amended complaint seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's conduct, and
of all remuneration, including restricted and unrestricted shares and options, obtained by Mr. Kozlowski during the course of this conduct. Discovery in this action has been stayed as a result
of a motion by the New York County District Attorney's Office. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New
Hampshire.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 03-CV-2247 (TPG), filed
April 1, 2003.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed an arbitration claim against Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and director, on
October 7, 2002. That arbitration claim alleged that Mr. Swartz breached his fiduciary duty and otherwise engaged in wrongful conduct relating to his employment by Tyco. As a consequence
of Mr. Swartz's refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association, we filed a civil complaint against him on April 1, 2003, for breach of fiduciary duty and
other wrongful conduct. The action alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from our Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program; approved and implemented awards of millions
of dollars in unauthorized bonuses to himself and certain other Tyco employees; awarded millions of dollars in other unauthorized payments to himself; engaged in improper self-dealing real
estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco employees in committing these acts. The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,
unjust enrichment, conversion, a constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The action seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of the former Chief Financial Officer and
director's conduct, and of all remuneration,


including
restricted and unrestricted shares and options, obtained by Mr. Swartz during the course of this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to
the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Mr. Swartz moved to dismiss Tyco's complaint and to compel arbitration of the parties' respective claims. The court denied
Swartz' motion and he has appealed the court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

Tyco International, Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court Southern District of New York, No.
02-CV-9705, filed December 6, 2002.

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we have filed a civil complaint against our former Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer and our former Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for disgorgement of short-swing profits from prohibited
transactions in our common shares believed to exceed $40 million. The action seeks disgorgement of profits, interest, attorneys' fees and costs. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the District Attorney of New York
County, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Hampshire and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management,
operations, accounting and related controls. We are cooperating with these investigations and are complying with these requests.

Certain
current and former employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices for the ADT
dealer connect fees. As previously reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued.

The
United States Department of Labor served document subpoenas on Tyco and Fidelity Management Trust Company for documents concerning the administration of the Tyco International
(US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans. The current focus of the Department's inquiry remains the losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in our stock. The
Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on behalf of the plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the plans for recovery of losses and additional penalties, although
it has not informed us of any intention to do so. The Company is continuing to cooperate with the Department's investigation.

In
November 2004, we received an order from the SEC to report facts and circumstances involving our participation, if any, in the United Nations Oil for Food Program governing sales of
Iraqi oil. We are gathering information responsive to the order and will fully cooperate in ongoing investigations.

Intellectual Property Litigation

Mallinckrodt, Inc. ("Mallinckrodt") and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc. ("Nellcor"), plaintiffs/counter-defendants v. Masimo
Corporation ("Masimo") et al., defendants/counter-claimants,

is a consolidated patent infringement action in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. Nellcor alleges that Masimo infringed one Nellcor patent related to pulse oximeters, which are medical devices used to measure blood oxygen levels in patients, and Masimo alleges that
Nellcor infringed four Masimo patents related to pulse oximeters. Trial in the action commenced on February 18, 2004. On March 16, 2004, the jury returned a liability finding that
Nellcor willfully infringed the four Masimo patents and that Masimo did not infringe the one Nellcor patent. On March 26, 2004, the jury awarded Masimo $134.5 million in damages for
Nellcor's alleged infringement through December 31, 2003. After hearing post-trial motions, the district court issued an order on July 14, 2004 which (i) denied
Masimo's request to impose an injunction on the sale of pulse oximeters; (ii) reversed the jury finding of patent infringement for one of the four patents at issue; (iii) ruled that a
second patent was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent; and (iv) overturned the jury finding that the infringement was "willful." On August 6, 2004,
the district court entered final judgment


that
included additional damages of $29.5 million for Nellcor's alleged infringement from January 1, 2004 through May 31, 2004. Nellcor is appealing the jury's infringement
finding on the remaining two Masimo patents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The briefing for the appeal is scheduled to be completed by February 28, 2005. The
Court of Appeals has not yet scheduled oral argument for the appeal. Tyco has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the jury's decision will be
overturned and, further, Tyco intends to vigorously pursue all available means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements with
respect to this damage award.

Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP ("Tyco Healthcare") and Mallinckrodt, Inc.

is a separate lawsuit also pending in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt are subsidiaries of Tyco. In this lawsuit, Masimo alleges violations of antitrust laws against
Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximeter products. Masimo alleges that Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt used their market position to prevent hospitals from purchasing
Masimo's pulse oximetry products. Masimo seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages. Trial is scheduled to begin on February 22, 2005. At this time, Tyco cannot
predict the outcome of the antitrust case and, therefore, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or the range of potential losses that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement in
this matter. It is possible that Tyco will be required to pay an award of damages in the antitrust lawsuit.

Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") v. United States Surgical ("U.S. Surgical")

is a patent infringement action in which
U.S. Surgical, a subsidiary of Tyco, is the defendant. In February 2002, the United States District Court for the Central District of California held that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL universal
seal system, contained in certain surgical trocar and access devices
manufactured by U.S. Surgical, infringed certain of the plaintiff's patents. The district court entered a permanent injunction against U.S. Surgical based upon infringement of one of the three patents
involved in the suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's permanent injunction ruling in September 2003 for the VERSASEAL product, which is
no longer on the market. In October 2003, the district court ruled in U.S. Surgical's favor, holding that two other patents involved in the case were invalid. A trial on damages for the earlier
infringement ruling in the district court concluded on July 27, 2004. The jury awarded Applied Medical $43.5 million in damages and returned a finding that the earlier infringement was
willful, giving the district court discretion to enhance those damages to up to treble the damages awarded to Applied Medical by the jury. On October 1, 2004, the district court issued
post-trial rulings that (i) denied U.S. Surgical's motion to set aside the jury's finding on willfulness; and (ii) granted Applied Medical's motion for enhanced damages,
enhancing the jury's damages award by 25%, or $11 million. The district court will also consider during post trial proceedings what pre-judgment interest, if any, should be awarded,
and whether Applied Medical is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees. After the proceedings are completed at the district court, U.S. Surgical will appeal the damages award and the willfulness
finding to the court of appeals. Tyco has recorded a liability related to this matter and does not expect to incur material losses beyond what has already been accrued.

On
July 31, 2003, Applied Medical filed another patent infringement suit against U.S. Surgical in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint alleges that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL Plus trocar product infringes Applied Medical's U.S. Patent No. 5,385,533. Applied Medical seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. Applied Medical filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the district court denied on December 23, 2003. Trial is
currently scheduled to commence in March 2005. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this patent infringement case and, therefore, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss
or range of potential losses that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement in this matter.


Environmental Litigation

On August 17, 2004, Tyco Printed Circuit Group, Limited Partnership ("TPCG"), a business within our Electronics segment, was sentenced for Clean Water Act
violations at three of its manufacturing facilities in Connecticut, pursuant to which it has paid a $6 million fine and an additional $4 million to fund environmental projects designed
to improve the environment for Connecticut residents. TPCG will also implement an environmental compliance plan at all TPCG printed circuit board manufacturing locations in the United States to
supplement existing environmental compliance programs and engage an independent third party to conduct an environmental audit of two TPCG manufacturing facilities in Connecticut. The United States
Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut has stated in a publicly filed court submission that there was no concrete evidence of environmental harm as a result of these violations and that no
one above the position of environmental health and safety manager at TPCG at its Connecticut facilities knew of, or was involved in, these violations.

In
September 2004, the Connecticut State Superior Court in Hartford, Connecticut entered a stipulated judgment executed by and among TPCG, the Connecticut Commissioner of the
Department of Environmental Protection (the "DEP") and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office with respect to a civil suit against TPCG, which suit alleged violations of Connecticut environmental
statutes and regulations arising out of the conduct investigated by the federal authorities at these same three facilities. Pursuant to this stipulated judgment, TPCG paid a $2 million civil
penalty to the DEP in October 2004, and will implement capital improvements to reduce the volume of wastewater discharged from its manufacturing facilities in Connecticut.

On
certain dates in 2002 and 2003, a business within our Engineered Products and Services segment reported purportedly incorrect data relating to landfill gas monitoring at four landfill
sites in Ohio. Our business is the contractor providing landfill gas monitoring and operations services at those sites. The reporting of this purportedly incorrect data may form the basis for
potential violations of the Clean Air Act and related state laws and regulations. To our knowledge, no action or proceeding has been filed by any state or federal authority in this matter to date. We
have disclosed this matter to our clients involved and to the City of Toledo, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

On
July 8, 2003, a fire accidentally ignited inside an oil storage tank that our Earth Tech subsidiary was demolishing at a power plant in Moss Landing, California. No injuries
resulted from the fire. Earth Tech has settled a civil enforcement action commenced by the Monterey County District Attorney's Office and has paid a total amount of $900,000 in civil penalties and
restitution. Additionally, as part of this civil settlement, Earth Tech has agreed to spend a minimum of $300,000 on employee education, training and compliance related to safety, health and
environmental requirements and procedures.

Commercial Litigation

Sensormatic v. Winner and Bagnara, Inc.

is a franchise dispute for which Sensormatic originally filed a complaint in 1999 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking declaratory relief. On June 28, 2004, the district court entered a stipulated judgment fixing the amount of the
defendant's past damages and commissions for royalties allegedly owed under the franchise agreement in the amount of $28 million, plus $5 million in pre-judgment interest,
and the entry of an injunction requiring Sensormatic to tender the franchise to the defendant. The judgment stays the imposition and payment of these damages and injunctive relief until resolution of
an appeal of the district court's underlying rulings on liability to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In the event the district court's rulings are affirmed, Sensormatic will
be required to pay the amount of stipulated damages and tender the franchise. On June 29, 2004, Sensormatic filed its Notice of Appeal to the court of appeals. Tyco intends to vigorously pursue
all available means to achieve a reversal. The company does not expect to incur material losses beyond what has already been accrued.

Dividend Policy

We may from time to time enter into financing agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit the ability of Tyco to pay
dividends. Future dividends on our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of Tyco's Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements
and surplus, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in
the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. The dividend is payable on February 1, 2005 to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2005.

earnings and other factors.


Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings
"Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Introduction

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its
subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United
States dollars, and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP").

The
Company operates in the following business segments:

•

Fire
and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems.

•

Electronics
designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components.

•

Healthcare
designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products.

•

Engineered
Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular
goods, and provides environmental and other industrial consulting services.

•

Plastics
and Adhesives designs, manufactures and distributes plastic products, adhesives and films.

Unless
otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2004, 2003 and 2002 are to Tyco's fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Overview

Our business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco businesses. We achieve this goal primarily through new
product innovation, increased market share, increasing the service and repair components of our existing businesses and continued geographic
expansion. We have implemented and continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments.

The
Company has engaged in a series of restructuring programs through which we have made our operations more efficient by exiting certain non-core businesses or business
lines, or streamlining general operations. The restructuring program announced in November 2003, designed to improve our cost structure primarily in Fire and Security, but also in Plastics and
Adhesives and Engineered Products and Services, was substantially completed in 2004. The impact of these restructuring programs on the operations of the Company are discussed in "Operating Results"
and "Segment Results." Additionally, the details related to the Company's divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations."


References
to Tyco are to the Company's continuing operations and prior year amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations. During 2004, Tyco's
Precision Interconnect business was transferred from Healthcare to Electronics. During 2003, the Company finalized its plan to sell the Tyco Global Network ("TGN") and, as a result, reorganized its
reporting structure such that the results of the TGN business held for sale are presented within Corporate and Other. Also during 2003, the Company changed its internal reporting structure such that
the operations of Tyco's plastics and adhesives businesses (previously reported within Healthcare and Specialty Products) now comprise the Plastics and Adhesives reportable segment. The Company has
conformed its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period information to reflect these changes.

The
Company made significant progress in 2004 towards meeting our strategic objectives. As described more fully in Segment Results below, over the course of 2004 we experienced solid
revenue growth in Electronics, Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, and to a lesser extent Fire and Security. We also expanded operating margins due in large part to the momentum and strong
results from our operational intensity programs. In addition to the strong operating performance, favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed positively to net revenue and operating income
growth in 2004, as well as in 2003.

Net
revenue increased 11.6% during 2004 to $40.2 billion from $36.0 billion in 2003. Net revenue increased 3.3% during 2003 as compared to $34.8 billion in 2002.
Tyco had income from continuing operations of $3,005 million in 2004, compared to $1,035 million in 2003, and a loss from continuing operations of $2,851 million in 2002.


The
effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for 2004 compared to 2003 was an increase in net revenue and operating income of $1,685 million and $230 million,
respectively. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for 2003 compared to 2002 was an increase in net revenue and operating income of $1,508 million and $191 million,
respectively. The 2004 and 2003 impact of foreign currency was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar.

Income
from continuing operations for 2004 included net charges totaling $755 million ($564 million after tax), consisting of the following: (i) charges for the
impairment of long-lived assets of $99 million, of which $34 million is attributable to machinery and equipment impairments at Fire and Security; (ii) net
restructuring and other charges of $256 million, of which charges of $7 million are included in cost of sales; (iii) net losses and impairments on divestitures totaling
$116 million; (iv) a loss of $284 million associated with the retirement of debt; and (v) a $5 million write-down of investments.

Income
from continuing operations for 2003 included net charges totaling $1,832 million ($1,566 million after-tax) consisting of the following:
(i) charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $815 million; (ii) charges recorded for changes in estimates of $389 million which arose from the
Company's intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews (includes net restructuring credits of $72 million, of which credits of $12 million are included in
costs of sales, charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $10 million, charges of $243 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, charges of
$123 million included in cost of sales, a charge of $76 million relating to the write-down of investments and other expense of $9 million, both of which are included
in other (expenses) income, net); (iii) charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million; (iv) other net loss of $128 million related to the retirement of debt;
(v) other charges of $148 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales related primarily to product warranty reserves and the dismantlement of customers' ADT
security systems, and $114 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses related primarily to uncollectible accounts receivable, internal investigation fees, as well as
severance and facility closures, slightly offset by a credit for changes in estimates of charges recorded in prior periods; (vi) a charge of $91 million for a retroactive, incremental
premium on prior period directors and officers insurance included in selling, general and administrative expenses; (vii) a charge of $12 million relating to the write-down of
investments; (viii) other interest expense of $2 million; (ix) other interest income of $19 million; and (x) net restructuring credits of $12 million, of
which charges of $2 million are included in cost of sales.

Loss
from continuing operations for 2002 included a net charge totaling $6,759 million ($6,091 million after-tax), consisting of the following:
(i) goodwill impairment charge of $1,344 million relating to continuing operations; (ii) charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $3,310 million
primarily related to the write-down of the TGN; (iii) net restructuring and other charges of $1,872 million, of which $636 million is included in cost of sales and
$115 million related to a bad debt provision is included in selling, general and administrative expenses; (iv) a write-off of purchased in-process research and
development of $18 million; (v) a loss on the write-off of investments of $271 million; (vi) a gain on divestiture of $24 million; and (vii) gain
from the retirement of debt of $30 million.

Segment Results

The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment. During 2004, divestitures impacted
certain of our segments as we implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. During 2003 and 2002, acquisitions were a significant
element of our growth strategy and, therefore, were a significant component of our results. See further details in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" and "Acquisitions" below.

Net
revenue for Fire and Security increased 5.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 9.2% increase in product revenue and a 2.8% increase in service revenue. Revenue from product
sales include sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates ($526 million) slightly
offset by the effects of divestitures ($82 million). To a lesser extent, the increase in net revenue was due to stronger sales to retailers within worldwide security and higher sales volume of
breathing systems and video and access control products at Tyco Safety Products. This increase was partially offset by weakness in the worldwide fire service business and Continental Europe Security.

Operating
income and margin increased significantly in 2004 as compared to 2003 due partially to total charges of $512 million which were recorded during 2003, discussed below.
Additionally, the increase in operating income and margin was due to improvements within worldwide security related primarily to the combined impact of a stronger retailer market environment and cost
reductions. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were improvements within Continental Europe Security as a result of cost saving initiatives and a changing business model and Tyco
Safety Products due primarily to increased volumes. The cost savings partly reflect the benefits of the restructuring activities described below. Operating income for 2004 also includes charges
totaling $264 million, consisting primarily of restructuring ($175 million, of which $4 million is included in cost of sales), impairment ($34 million) and divestiture
($55 million) charges, substantially all of which are associated with the comprehensive cost reduction measures that began during 2003.

Attrition
rates for customers in our global electronic security services business decreased to an average of 15.1% on a trailing twelve-month basis for 2004, as compared to 15.9% for
2003.

Net
revenue for Fire and Security increased 6.1% in 2003 as compared to 2002, including a 3.4% increase in product revenue and an 8.5% increase in service revenue. The increase in net
revenue was due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($459 million) and 2002 acquisitions ($214 million calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions").
Acquisitions included SBC/Smith Alarm Systems, DSC Group ("DSC") and Sensormatic Electronics Corporation ("Sensormatic") in early 2002, and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of
$10 million or more. In addition, an increase in net revenues due to customer contracts purchased through the ADT dealer program ($371 million) and generated through our internal sales
force offset a decline in net revenue due to increased attrition rates in worldwide security. The overall increase was also partially offset by a decline in net revenue at the worldwide fire
protection business due to softness in the commercial construction market.

Operating
income and margin decreased significantly in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to charges totaling $512 million recorded during 2003. Included within the $512 million
are charges of $266 million (includes charges of $128 million primarily related to adjustments to liabilities such as workers' compensation, professional fees, and environmental
exposure, a charge of $98 million primarily due to adjusting allowances for doubtful accounts and slow and non-moving inventory, as well


as
a write-off of subscriber systems, charges of $34 million for other adjustments primarily related to deferred commissions, and charges of $6 million related to reconciling
items in the current period) recorded in connection with the Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews performed during the year. Also included within the
$512 million are impairment charges of $143 million primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the ADT dealer program mostly as a result of increased
attrition rates (discussed below), and to the impairment of property, plant and equipment of subscriber systems and other fixed assets; net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of
which charges of $4 million are included in cost of sales and $3 million is for the write-off of non-current assets, related to streamlining the business; and
other charges of $93 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales and $59 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to
uncollectible receivables, product warranty and the dismantlement of customers' ADT security systems. Included within the $143 million impairment charge and the $10 million net
restructuring charge is a charge of $10 million and a credit of $2 million, respectively, also related to changes in estimates recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2003.
The decrease in operating income and margins was also due to increased depreciation and amortization expense in the security business due to growth in the subscriber asset and dealer asset base as
well as the impact of the acquisitions of Sensormatic and DSC in 2002; decline in operating income in the Continental European Security business; and a weaker worldwide fire and contracting
environment.

Attrition
rates for customers in our global electronic security services business averaged 15.9% on a trailing twelve-month basis for 2003, as compared to 13.2% for 2002. This increase
relates to attrition in customer accounts acquired through our worldwide dealer program, as well as internally generated commercial customer accounts in continental Europe and internally generated
residential customer accounts in the United States (both of which were partly driven by increased management and control of delinquent accounts). For those account pools experiencing increased
attrition, prior lifing studies were re-examined. The Company concluded that existing amortization methods and asset lives continue to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition
data for these pools.

Operating
income and margin in 2002 include a net restructuring and other charge of $95 million. The net $95 million charge includes charges of $113 million, of
which inventory write-downs of $19 million are reflected in cost of sales. These charges are primarily related to severance and facility exit costs associated with streamlining the business,
slightly offset by a credit of $18 million relating to current and prior years' restructuring charges. Also included within operating income in 2002 is a charge of $18 million for the
write-off of purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisitions of Sensormatic and DSC and a charge of $115 million for the impairment of
property, plant and equipment resulting primarily from the termination of a software development project and, to a lesser extent, from the curtailment, and in certain markets, the termination of the
ADT dealer program in certain non-U.S. markets.

Net
revenue for Electronics increased 12.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 13.1% increase in product revenue and a 2.3% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue
was primarily a result of growth in our existing businesses, specifically, the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, communications and industrial and commercial markets. However, we continue to
experience a decrease in sales of Power Systems products in North America and in our Electrical Contracting Services, which was divested in September 2004. To a lesser extent, the increase in
net revenue resulted from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($560 million).

The
40.9% increase in operating income and the 3.0% increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above, cost saving initiatives that
were executed in 2003, the positive impact of foreign currency ($90 million) and fewer charges recorded in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases in operating income were partially offset by
an 80 basis point impact of increased metal prices for copper and gold. Operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges totaling $22 million.
These net charges include a $52 million charge related to the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business, partially offset by $33 million of net restructuring credits
related to changes in estimates of severance, facility exit costs, distributor and supplier cancellation fees recorded in prior periods and the impact of the sale of assets that were impaired in prior
years for amounts greater than originally anticipated. These net charges also include a $3 million charge related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment.

Net
revenue for Electronics decreased slightly in 2003 as compared to 2002. Net revenue at the electronic components group increased $442 million, or 4.5% due primarily to the
favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Net revenue for the submarine telecommunications business declined $542 million, or 79.9%, due to completion of third-party undersea fiber
optic system installations in 2002. Overall, the decrease in net revenue for the submarine telecommunications business more than offset the increase in total net revenue due to favorable changes in
foreign currency exchange rates of $524 million, and $69 million (calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions") due to the acquisitions of Transpower Technologies in
November 2001, Communications Instruments, Inc. in January 2002, and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more.

The
increase in operating income and margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 was due to operating losses in the prior year, primarily as a result of charges totaling $1,965 million
(discussed below) that were recorded in 2002. Operating income and margin for 2003 include net charges totaling $236 million. The $236 million consists primarily of charges for the
impairment of goodwill of $278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group, restructuring credits of $72 million, of which $20 million
is included in cost of sales, related primarily to changes in estimates of severance and facility exit costs recorded in prior years and charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of
$1 million. The net restructuring credit of $72 million includes $55 million of credits, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Company's intensified
internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Also


included
within the $236 million are charges of $14 million related to adjusting asset reserves, $6 million related to the adjustments to accrual balances, $9 million of
reconciliation and other accounting adjustments, which were also recorded in connection with the Company's intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during
2003.

The
operating loss in 2002 was primarily due to restructuring and other charges as well as the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in addition to the decrease in revenue. In the
electronic components business, the overall decrease in demand resulted in much lower manufacturing volumes across all business units, which increased per unit costs. In the Submarine
Telecommunications business, margin was impacted significantly by a significant reduction in third party system builds.

Operating
loss and margin for 2002 include net restructuring and other charges of $1,115 million. The $1,115 million net charge includes charges totaling
$1,141 million, of which inventory reserves of $609 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to initiatives taken to reduce fixed costs, due to the
significant downturn in the telecommunications business and certain electronics end markets, including facility closures, headcount reductions, inventory reserves and purchase commitment
cancellations. These charges were slightly offset by a restructuring credit of $26 million primarily relating to a revision in estimates of current and prior years' severance and facilities
charges. Total inventory charges of $833 million include $609 million of inventory write-downs and $212 million of supplier contract termination fees. In 2002, $20 million
was originally included in the inventory written down and was recorded as a restructuring credit to cost of sales in 2003. Also included within operating loss and margins for 2002 are charges of
$569 million for the impairment of long lived assets, and goodwill impairment charges of $281 million related to Tyco Submarine Telecommunications.

Net
revenue for Healthcare increased 8.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in our existing businesses and favorable foreign
currency exchange rates ($292 million). Growth in Healthcare's underlying businesses was primarily a result of increased net revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies, and to a lesser extent,
at Pharmaceuticals. The increase at Medical Devices & Supplies was largely driven by higher sales volume within our International division, particularly in Europe, due to benefits realized from the
sales force investment, back order recovery, growth in Spain and Italy and the absence of an unfavorable $47 million contractual adjustment recorded in 2003. Also contributing to the increase
in Medical Devices and Supplies were higher sales within the Medical division resulting primarily from new SharpSafety product launches and gain in market share within the wound care market.

The
12.4% increase in operating income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the favorable margin impact of the increased sales discussed above, favorable foreign currency
exchange rates and a continued focus on maximizing operating efficiencies. Operating income was adversely impacted by a $29 million increase in legal liabilities for an ongoing patent
infringement suit, and a $59 million increase in research and development costs. Additionally, 2004 operating income includes


net
restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $18 million, composed of: (i) restructuring charges of $13 million related to the closure of various facilities offset by
a credit of $2 million due to costs being less than anticipated; (ii) a $4 million divestiture charge resulting from a loss on the sale of a business and
(iii) $3 million of impairment charges related to the closure of various facilities.

Net
revenue for Healthcare increased 8.4% in 2003 as compared to 2002, including an 8.5% increase in product revenue and a 7.0% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue
resulted primarily from growth in our existing businesses and favorable foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions, net of divestitures. Growth in our existing businesses
was due to the following: increases in the Surgical division concurrent with the award of a major contract and continued organic growth within certain surgical stapling lines; increases in the Medical
division resulting from the award of a significant wound care contract, coupled with the exit of a major competitor from the traditional wound care business; new product launches and higher demand in
the ultrasound market; increases in Pharmaceuticals and Imaging due to higher volumes and increased market share; and, strong sales within the Respiratory division. These sales increases were
partially offset by a decrease in the diaper product segment of the Retail business largely resulting from the adverse impact of the industry-wide down-count issues, and a
decline in the International division due to lower sales in continental Europe and Latin America. The increase in net revenue also resulted from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates
($268 million) and incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of Paragon Trade Brands ("Paragon") in January 2002 ($124 million calculated in the manner described below in
"Acquisitions"), slightly offset by a decline in revenue ($48 million) related to the divestiture of Surgical Dynamics, Inc. in July 2002.

The
14.8% increase in operating income and increase in margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 were due primarily to favorable margin impact as a result of higher sales and favorable
manufacturing variances as a result of increased production volumes, a shift to a more favorable product mix, and cost savings as a result of the closure of certain Paragon facilities, back office
consolidations and our continued focus on optimizing operating expenses. Slightly offsetting the effect of those items were increased legal fees, insurance and pension expense, and higher sales and
marketing expense as a result of program development aimed at supporting organic growth initiatives. Also contributing to the increase in operating income and margins were favorable fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. During 2003, we recorded net credits totaling $2 million, including restructuring credits of $8 million
due to actual costs being less than anticipated, and a credit of $7 million related to an insurance reimbursement for certain legal fees associated with product liability cases. These credits
were largely offset by charges of $12 million related to asset reserves for inventory and charges of $1 million for adjustments to accrual balances related to workers' compensation,
which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying management's judgments and
estimates.

Operating
income and margin for 2002 reflect net restructuring and other charges of $45 million. The $45 million net charge includes charges of $49 million, of which
inventory write-downs of $1 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to severance associated with the consolidation of operations and facility related costs due to
exiting certain business lines, and are partially offset by a credit of $4 million relating to current and prior years' restructuring charges. Operating income and margin for 2002 also include
a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of $2 million.

Net
revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $1,509 million or 33.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003, of which $739 million, or 16.4%, represents a change in how
we classify certain sub-contract and other costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re-billed to their customers. These costs have historically been treated as "pass
through" and were therefore not included in reported revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the Company began reflecting these
sub-contract costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. The Company has not adjusted revenue or cost of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2003 and
2002 as such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no impact on previously reported operating income, net income (loss) or cash flow.

The
remaining increase in net revenue resulted primarily from increased demand and higher selling prices at Electrical & Metal Products and at Tyco Fire & Building Products
and favorable foreign currency exchange rates in all businesses ($298 million). Further contributing to the increase, although to a much lesser extent, were improved business conditions at
Infrastructure Services due primarily to an improved construction market and continued market share growth. Sales remained flat at Flow Control as the impact of lower levels of
non-residential construction and industrial capital spending, primarily in North America, were offset by improved activity in other end markets and geographic regions.

The
71.3% increase in operating income and the 2.3% increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were due primarily to increased net revenue discussed above, the impact of cost
reduction programs initiated in prior periods and the positive impact of foreign currency ($31 million). These favorable increases were partly offset by the impact of higher raw material costs.
Additionally, operating income includes net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $62 million in 2004 compared to $56 million (discussed below) in 2003. Included in the
$62 million charge is $53 million of restructuring and $4 million of impairment charges related to the consolidation of manufacturing, distribution and office locations and
activities at Flow Control and Infrastructure Services. The remaining $5 million divestiture charge primarily relates to an impairment of goodwill related to the sale of a business. The revenue
reclassification at Infrastructure Services discussed above had no impact on operating income for 2004; however, this adjustment lowered 2004 operating margin by 1.5 percentage points.

Net
revenue for Engineered Products and Services slightly decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002, including a 1.6% decrease in product revenue partially offset by a 4.5% increase in
service revenue. Net revenue decreased year over year, as the increase in net revenue due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($219 million) and the effect of acquisitions
($41 million calculated in a manner described below in "Acquisitions") was more than offset by weak conditions in major markets at Flow Control and Electrical & Metal Products, most
notably in non-residential construction. Also contributing to the overall decrease were lower levels of capital spending and increased pricing pressure, resulting in lower selling prices.
The $41 million effect from acquisitions included Century


Tube
Corporation in October 2001, Water & Power Technologies in November 2001, Clean Air Systems in February 2002 and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of
$10 million or more.

The
44.2% increase in operating income and the increase in margin in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to lower than usual operating income in the prior year period as a result of recording
charges of $377 million (discussed below). During 2003, we recorded charges totaling $56 million, which includes charges of $32 million related to changes in estimates recorded in
connection with the Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews, and as a result of applying management's judgments and estimates (including $19 million
related to adjustments to workers' compensation and $13 million associated with asset reserves). These charges also include charges of $8 million, of which a $6 million charge is
included in cost of sales, for 2003 restructuring plans partially offset by changes in estimates due to actual costs being less than originally anticipated, charges for the impairment of
long-lived assets of $2 million relating to manufacturing and distribution consolidation at Flow Control and cost reduction projects, and other costs of $14 million included
within selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to the reorganization and consolidation of a manufacturing facility and certain business offices. Operating income and margin were
also negatively impacted by the lower sales discussed above, competitive conditions in major markets for valves and controls, thermal controls, and electrical and metal products, and increased raw
material costs, primarily steel.

Operating
income and margin for 2002 reflect $377 million of restructuring and other charges consisting of $48 million, of which inventory write-downs of $6 million
are included in cost of sales, primarily related to severance and facility exit costs associated with streamlining the business. Also included are charges of $10 million for the impairment of
property, plant and equipment associated with the closure of facilities, and goodwill impairment charges of $319 million relating to Tyco Infrastructure Services.

Net
revenue increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in price ($44 million) and volume ($4 million) in Plastics. Additionally, foreign
currency had a positive impact of $9 million on net revenue, and increased volume in Ludlow Coated Products ($5 million) from its building products and flexible packaging business also
contributed to the overall increase. These increases were largely offset by softness in A&E Products ($49 million), particularly in the Americas Hangers business, in Asia and in the Catering
business and a slight decline in Adhesives sales volume in the Corrosion Protection business.

The
significant decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to impairment ($47 million) and restructuring charges
($44 million) incurred during 2004 totaling $91 million associated with the closure of various facilities. The decreases in net revenue discussed above and margin declines at A&E
Products due to lower volumes and pricing pressure also contributed to the decrease in operating income and margin. Operating income and margin for 2003 includes a net credit of $1 million
discussed below.

Net
revenue at Tyco Plastics and Adhesives increased slightly in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the effect of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($38 million)
and acquisitions


($21 million
calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions"), which included LINQ Industrial Fabrics, Inc. in December 2001 and all other acquisitions with a purchase
price of $10 million or more. Sales increases were achieved by higher selling prices as a result of higher raw material costs, increased sales volume of plastic sheeting and duct tape products
as a result of the heightened level of security related to the potential likelihood of terrorist attacks, and a strong residential construction market for Ludlow Coated Products. These increases were
more than offset by increased competition and decreases in our Corrosion Protection business, which had been negatively impacted by a slow down in the oil and gas pipeline construction markets created
by uncertainty in the Middle East and Venezuela, and a decline in hanger sales due to weak demand in the retail garment industry.

The
significant decrease in operating income and decrease in operating margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 were primarily due to increased raw material costs (primarily polyethylene) and
increased pricing competition driven by excess production capacity and an increase in lower priced imported goods. During 2003, Tyco Plastics and Adhesives recorded net credits totaling
$1 million. These credits include charges of $6 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and
operating reviews and as a result of applying management's judgments and estimates (including $3 million for adjustments to accrual balances, and $3 million related to asset reserves for
inventory), restructuring credits of $1 million due to costs being less than anticipated and a credit of $6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit.

Operating
income and margin for 2002 reflect net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of which inventory write-downs of $1 million are included in cost of sales.
These charges primarily relate to severance associated with the consolidation of operations and facility related costs due to exiting certain business lines. Operating income and margins for 2002 also
include a charge for the write-off of long-lived assets of $3 million primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets.

Corporate and Other

Corporate net revenue of $25 million, $14 million and $8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relates to the TGN business, which is
classified as held for sale. Corporate expense was $385 million, $1,161 million and $3,510 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which includes operating losses of
$73 million, $760 million and $3,090 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the TGN business held for sale.

Corporate
expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $8 million and net
restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters.

Corporate
expense for 2003 includes charges totaling $824 million. Included within the $824 million is a charge of $91 million for an incremental increase in
directors and officers insurance and charges of $39 million related to internal investigation fees. Also included is a charge of $20 million primarily related to severance and benefits
for corporate employees and a restructuring credit of $11 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, both of which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the
Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying management's judgments and estimates. Also included within the $824 million are net
restructuring credits of $10 million, other net charges of $16 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges for the impairment of long-lived
assets of $679 million primarily related to the TGN business held for sale and, to a lesser extent, the closure and relocation of corporate offices and related severance and benefits.


Corporate expense in 2002 includes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $3,914 million including $2,582 million related to the impairment of the TGN,
$29 million related to the impairment of certain properties associated with the consolidation of corporate headquarters, $744 million related to goodwill impairment within the TGN
business held for sale, and net restructuring and other charges of $559 million primarily related to charges within the TGN business held for sale and, to a lesser extent, the
write-off of investment banking fees and other deal costs associated with the terminated breakup plan and certain acquisitions that were not completed, costs incurred for the internal
investigation, and severance.

The
significant restructuring charges recorded in 2002 were primarily related to the restructuring of the TGN business held for sale to address the significant overcapacity in the market
and resulting lack of demand for new system construction. In the fourth quarter of 2002, management decided to focus the business for the foreseeable future on maintenance revenue and capacity sales
on the TGN, to discontinue future additions to the TGN, and to limit construction activities to small projects that were cash flow positive with at least breakeven earnings. As a result of this
strategy, management devised a plan to significantly downsize the manufacturing footprint, decrease project management staffing, reduce the research and development function and minimize staffing and
expense in all other administrative areas of the business to decrease cash outflows and losses to the maximum extent possible. This plan was carefully crafted to ensure that both the technical and
construction competencies of the business would be preserved in the event industry conditions improve.

Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was $91 million in 2004, as compared to $107 million and $117 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Interest
expense was $963 million in 2004, as compared to $1,148 million in 2003 and $1,076 million in 2002. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to
2003 is primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in 2004 and the favorable impact of interest rate swap agreements executed during the year. The increase in interest expense in 2003 over
2002 is primarily the result of the benefit from the cancellation of certain swaps in 2002 and a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of the TGN, partially offset by a lower average
outstanding debt balance during 2003. The weighted-average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 5.4%, 4.9% and 4.5%, respectively. The weighted-average interest
rate during 2004 increased due to the retirement of lower interest rate debt.


Other Expense, Net

During 2004, net other expense of $286 million consisted primarily of a $284 million loss related to the repurchase of a portion of its outstanding
convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases.

During
2003, net other expense of $223 million consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for details regarding debt repurchases. Additionally, net other expense included an $87 million loss relating to the write-down of various investments when it became
evident that the declines in the fair value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications
industry.

During
2002, net other expense of $217 million consisted primarily of a $271 million loss on various investments, mainly related to its investments in FLAG Telecom
Holdings Ltd. ("FLAG") when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of FLAG and other investments were other than temporary. This loss was partially offset by a gain of
$30 million related to the retirement of debt and a net gain on divestiture of $24 million (see "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" below).

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 27.4%, 42.2% and (7.6)% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in the effective rate from 2003 to 2004 is
principally the result of increased profitability in operations primarily in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a decrease in nondeductible charges. The change in the effective tax rate from 2002
to 2003 is primarily the result of a decrease in impairment
and other charges which did not provide a tax benefit and a decrease in other non-deductible charges.

During
2004, the Company made substantial changes to its tax reporting and compliance processes, including preparation of amended U.S. federal income tax returns, hiring and training of
additional tax personnel and the completion of a comprehensive review, analysis and reconciliation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2003 and September 30,
2004. The presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2003 has been reclassified for comparability purposes as a result of this comprehensive deferred tax analysis.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,992 million and $1,879 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relates principally to the
uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income
to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 109 which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
for the years 1997 to 2000. In connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues
raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and
estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes will be due.


These
tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the
issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

In
connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997-2000, the Company prepared proposed amendments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the
taxable income previously reported. The IRS is currently reviewing the proposed amendments. The Company has not recorded the impact of the proposed amendments, pending the completion of the IRS
review. The proposed amendments, if accepted, will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed
amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. The proposed amendments are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially
permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such
subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related
to investments in subsidiaries.

Divestitures and Discontinued Operations

During 2003, we conducted a comprehensive review of our core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. This strategy is
intended to sharpen our focus on core businesses, simplify operations and improve cost structure. This divestiture program is designed to increase the focus on our core operations by exiting certain
operations that do not meet our criteria for strategic fit or financial returns. In November 2003, we estimated that the potential proceeds excluding the proceeds from the sale of the TGN could
be at least $400 million once the program is completed. Cumulative proceeds through the date of this filing are approximately $412 million. As part of this program, we planned to sell
the TGN, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. The market for the TGN is challenged by significant overcapacity and severe pricing pressure and the industry is in need of consolidation.
However, we plan to retain ownership of the telecommunications systems supply business which provides maintenance and undersea cable construction. In November 2004, we agreed to sell the TGN to
one of India's telephone and internet service providers for $130 million. As discussed in Note 3, the entire value of the TGN has been written-off. The sale is subject to governmental
approval in the United States, India and other countries.

2004 Activity

During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments of divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or
write-down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. In addition, the Company also recorded losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million
($123 million after tax) to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value.


In
connection with the divestiture program announced in November 2003, the Company divested twenty-one and liquidated four non-core businesses across all business segments,
except Plastics and Adhesives and primarily within Fire and Security, for aggregate proceeds of $252 million in cash, of which $16 million of the proceeds are currently held in escrow.
Total assets and total liabilities of the divested businesses were $445 million and $115 million, respectively. Total assets include cash retained by the businesses sold of
$13 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the Company divested an additional seven non-core businesses realizing aggregate proceeds of approximately $160 million.

Net
revenue and net loss for 2004 through the date of disposition were $460 million and $43 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet the criteria for
discontinued operations. Net revenue and net income for the year ended September 30, 2003 were $587 million and $24 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet the criteria
for discontinued operations.

Net
revenue of 2004 discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $889 million, $815 million and $766 million,
respectively. Pretax (loss) income of these discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $(135) million, $7 million and $19 million,
respectively.

2003 Activity

During 2003, Tyco recorded income from discontinued operations of $20 million for a restitution payment made by Frank E. Walsh Jr., a former director (see
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

2002 Activity

During 2002, the Company sold certain of its businesses for net proceeds of $139 million in cash that consisted primarily of businesses within Healthcare
and Fire and Security. In connection with these dispositions, the Company recorded a net gain of $24 million, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

On
July 8, 2002, the Company divested Tyco Capital (CIT Group Inc.) through the sale of 100% of the common shares of CIT Group Inc. ("CIT"), its principal operating subsidiary, in
an initial public offering ("IPO"). Accordingly, the results of Tyco Capital are presented as discontinued operations. Operating results from the discontinued operations of Tyco Capital from
October 1, 2001 through July 8, 2002 were $3.3 billion of finance income, $6.0 billion of pre-tax loss and $6.3 billion of net loss. The net loss
includes a goodwill impairment charge of $6,638 million.


During
the quarter ended March 31, 2002, Tyco experienced disruptions to its business surrounding its announced break-up plan, a downgrade in its credit ratings, and a
significant decline in its market capitalization. During this same time period, CIT also experienced credit downgrades and a disruption to its historical funding base. Further, market-based
information developed in connection with the Company's preliminary consideration of the proposed IPO of CIT indicated that CIT's book value exceeded its estimated fair value as of March 31,
2002. As a result, the Company performed a SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," first step impairment analysis as of March 31, 2002 and concluded that an impairment
charge was warranted at that time.

Management's
objective in performing the first step goodwill impairment analysis was to obtain relevant market-based data to calculate the estimated fair value of CIT as of
March 31, 2002 based on its projected earnings and market factors expected to be used by market participants in ascribing value to CIT in the planned separation of CIT from Tyco. Management
obtained relevant market data from financial advisors regarding the range of price to earnings multiples and market condition discounts applicable to CIT as of March 31, 2002 and applied these
market data to CIT's projected annual earnings as of March 31, 2002 to calculate an estimated fair value and any resulting goodwill impairment. The estimated fair value was compared to the
corresponding carrying value of CIT at March 31, 2002. As a result, the Company recorded a $4,513 million impairment charge as of March 31, 2002, which is included in discontinued
operations.

A
second step goodwill impairment analysis is required whenever a reporting unit's book value exceeds estimated fair value. This analysis required the Company to estimate the fair value
of the reporting unit's individual assets and liabilities to complete the analysis of goodwill as of March 31, 2002. The
Company completed this second step analysis for CIT during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and, as a result, recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $132 million. During the
June 30, 2002 quarter, CIT experienced further credit downgrades and the business environment and other factors continued to negatively impact the likely proceeds of the IPO. As a result, the
Company performed another first step and second step analysis as of June 30, 2002 in a manner consistent with the March 2002 process described above. Each of these analyses was based
upon updated market data at June 30, 2002 and through the period immediately following the IPO, including the IPO proceeds. These analyses resulted in a goodwill impairment of
$1,867 million. Tyco also recorded an additional impairment charge of $126 million in order to write-down its investment in CIT to fair value for a total CIT goodwill
impairment of $2,125 million. This write-down was based upon net IPO proceeds of approximately $4.4 billion, after deducting estimated out-of-pocket
expenses, and is included in the $6,283 million loss from discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Tyco recorded a loss on the sale of Tyco Capital of $59 million.

Acquisitions

Prior to 2003, acquisitions were a significant element of our growth strategy. When we acquired a business, we began to integrate the acquired company with our
existing operations immediately, and, consequently, we were generally unable to separately identify the post-acquisition financial results of acquired companies. The revenue growth or
decline attributable to such acquisitions, which are included in segment discussions for 2003 and 2002, were estimates calculated by assuming the acquisitions were made at the beginning of the
relevant year by adding back pre-acquisition revenue of the acquired companies for both periods. These calculations included all acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or
more and did not include acquisitions with a purchase price of less than $10 million, due to the relative size of these smaller acquisitions compared to Tyco's operating results and the large
number of acquisitions during 2003 and 2002. These smaller acquisitions represent approximately 6% of the total purchase price for all acquisitions during 2003 and 2002. Since these estimates are
based on pre-acquisition revenue, they are not necessarily indicative of post-acquisition results. This calculation is similar to the method used in calculating the acquisition
related pro forma


results
of operations in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements pursuant to SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations."

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the
Company's segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications.
During 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," (revised December 2003 as FIN No. 46R) and,
accordingly, restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN 46 for off-balance sheet accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and,
consequently, recorded a $75 million after-tax loss ($115 million pretax) cumulative effect adjustment. In addition, total debt increased by $498 million at the time
of consolidation, July 1, 2003.

In
2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity
method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto
the Company's balance sheet effective July 1, 2003. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included on the Company's balance sheet at that time were $112 million and
$96 million, respectively.

Subsequently,
these four joint ventures were deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 with the adoption of FIN 46R. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included in the
Company's balance sheet at September 30, 2003 were $96 million and $69 million, respectively.

Change in Fiscal Year

On November 4, 2004, the Board of Directors approved the change in our fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a
"52-53 week" year ending on the Friday nearest September 30, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. Once every seven years, starting in 2011, the fourth
quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have consistently closed their books up to one month prior to our fiscal period end. We plan to report
results for these subsidiaries using the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. While the expected December holiday-related slow-down in certain customer sales is expected to
shift from the second fiscal quarter to the first fiscal quarter, the impact of this change is not expected to be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This change is also consistent with
our ongoing efforts to enhance controls and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns our external reporting with our internal operational processes. This change will be
effective for our first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004. The results for the transition period related to this change will be reported as an adjustment within Shareholders' Equity. No
transition report is required for these changes.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") requires management
to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are
based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.


Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems

—Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets
in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the
depreciable lives of subscriber systems included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets, are
primarily based on historical attrition rates, third-party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be
impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization.

With
respect to Tyco's depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate
pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco
concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight-line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen-year period continues to be appropriate given the
observed actual attrition data for these pools.

Tyco
purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer
contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships).

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of
economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the
double-declining balance method based on a ten-year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of
the customer relationships converting to the straight-line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly
reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above.

Attrition
rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business were 15.1%, 15.9% and 13.2% on a trailing 12-month basis as of September 30, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Goodwill

—In performing the annual goodwill assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results,
business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in
applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since management's judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be
overstated or understated.

We
elected to make July 1 the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present
value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating
conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods.

Disruptions
to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a
significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a SFAS No. 142 first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting
units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.


During
2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairments of $60 million of which $48 million related to divested businesses and $12 million related to businesses
classified as held for sale, respectively. The Company also recorded goodwill impairments of $278 million and $1,344 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

—Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea
cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon
contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The
risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long-term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as
contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If
estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated.

Income Taxes

—In determining income (loss) for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments.
These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international
pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any
reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An
increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance
occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to
the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the
reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax


liabilities
relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date
of acquisition.

Long-Lived Assets

—Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of
long-lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates,
reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long-lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved
in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may be overstated or understated.

The net change in total working capital, net of the effects of divestitures and acquisitions, was a cash decrease of $906 million in 2004,
including cash paid for restructuring and other charges of $266 million. The components of this change are set forth in detail in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant
changes in working capital included a $225 million increase in inventories and a $153 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by an increase of $406 million in income
taxes payable. Also, during 2004 we significantly decreased our participation in our sale of accounts receivable programs resulting in an additional $929 million increase in accounts
receivable. We strive to maximize our cash flow by minimizing the working capital employed in our businesses.

During
2004, 2003 and 2002 we paid out $266 million, $503 million and $518 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 2 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities.


During
2004, 2003 and 2002, Tyco paid $254 million, $597 million and $1,138 million of cash, respectively, to acquire 0.3 million, 0.6 million and
1.4 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.

During
2004, 2003 and 2002, we paid $107 million, $272 million and $625 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback/earn-out
liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions
which require Tyco to make additional "earn-out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These
earn-out payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth.

At
September 30, 2004, the acquisition liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $123 million, of which $29 million is included in accrued and other
current liabilities and $94 million is included in other liabilities. In addition, holdback/earn-out liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $167 million, of
which $59 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $108 million are included in other liabilities.

As
previously discussed, during 2003, we conducted a comprehensive review of Tyco's core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. In November 2003 we
estimated that the potential proceeds, excluding the proceeds from the sale of the TGN, could be at least $400 million once the program is completed. Cumulative proceeds through the date of
this filing are approximately $412 million. As part of this program, we planned to sell the TGN, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. In November 2004, we agreed to sell
the TGN to one of India's telephone and internet service providers for $130 million. As discussed in Note 3, the entire value of the TGN has been written-off. The sale is subject to
governmental approval in the United States, India and other countries.

We
continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards.
During 2003 and 2002, we spent $113 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, on construction of the TGN. Construction of the TGN was completed during 2003. Consequently, the level of
capital expenditures in Electronics decreased in 2004. The level of capital expenditures in the other segments is not expected to exceed depreciation in 2005 and is expected to increase slightly
relative to the level of spending in 2004.

The
provision for income taxes relating to continuing operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2004 was $1,140 million, and the amount of income taxes paid, net
of refunds, during the year was $550 million. The difference is due to timing differences, as well as net operating loss carryforward and carryback utilization.

Capitalization

Shareholders' equity was $30.3 billion at September 30, 2004, compared to $26.4 billion at September 30, 2003. This increase was due
primarily to net income of $2.9 billion and foreign currency translation of $704 million.

At
September 30, 2004, total debt decreased $4.2 billion to $16.7 billion, as compared to $21.0 billion at September 30, 2003. Total debt as a
percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders' equity) was 36% at September 30, 2004 and 44% at September 30, 2003. The decrease in debt resulted principally from the
repayments of debt detailed below partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion 6.0% notes due 2013 by Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA") in November 2003. Our cash balance
increased to $4,467 million at September 30, 2004, as compared to $4,186 million at September 30, 2003.


In
November 2003, TIGSA issued $1.0 billion 6.0% notes due 2013 in a private placement offering. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco. The net
proceeds of approximately $988 million were used to repay a portion of the $2.0 billion outstanding under the 5-year revolving credit facility due 2006. These notes were
subsequently exchanged for registered notes with substantially identical terms in an exchange offer that expired on May 3, 2004.

In
November 2003, holders of principal amount at maturity of $3,197 million of zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 notified Tyco that they had exercised their
option to require Tyco to repurchase their debentures at a price of $775.66 per $1,000 principal at maturity, representing the accreted value of the debentures on that date. On November 18,
2003, Tyco purchased these debentures for cash of $2,480 million.

In
December 2003, TIGSA entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility, which includes a one year term-out option, and a
$1.5 billion 3-year revolving bank credit facility. These facilities have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIGSA can vary based on changes
in its credit rating.
These new facilities replaced the $1.5 billion undrawn 364-day revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in January 2004, and the $2.0 billion drawn
5-year revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in February 2006. As of September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility. The
$1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility expires on December 20, 2004, and we expect that the facility will be replaced by a $1.0 billion 5-year
revolving credit facility prior to its expiration. The $1.5 billion 3-year revolving credit facility expires on December 22, 2006.

In
June 2004, the Company purchased $303 million of its 8.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including
unamortized debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt.

In
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid
was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

Our
bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum
levels of net worth, and other covenants that limit our ability to pledge assets and to make substantial payments in connection with our capital shares. At September 30, 2004, we had three
synthetic lease facilities, of which one has since expired on December 10, 2004, with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our outstanding indentures contain
customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants is presently considered restrictive to our operations. We are
currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

In
2004, we made voluntary contributions to our pension plans totaling approximately $575 million.

The
above transactions support Tyco's previously discussed strategy to strengthen its balance sheet by using a portion of its excess cash to reduce debt.

We
plan to use available cash to continue to fund internal growth and cost reduction opportunities within our businesses. Additionally, we believe that our cash flow generation
capability will allow us to continue to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. While debt reduction remains our focus in the near term, we may consider an appropriate
acquisition should the opportunity arise. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share.

At September 30, 2004, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $1.6 billion.

At
September 30, 2004, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.0 billion due December 20, 2004, and $1.5 billion due December 22, 2006, both of
which were undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements). We expect that the existing $1.0 billion facility will be replaced by a $1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility prior to its expiration. In
addition, certain of the Company's operating subsidiaries have overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $434 million, of which $326 million was undrawn and available at
September 30, 2004. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations.

At
September 30, 2004, the Company had a contingent liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by Electronics. This represents the
maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has
approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. No provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably
determined.

In
June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3-year unsecured letter of credit facility. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit,
supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this
facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSA's bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSA's 6% notes due 2013
issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the bank's base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the
occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the


Company
to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Legal Matters

Class Actions

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and
litigation against our former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named
as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses
and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments
or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Investigation

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Subpoenas and Document
Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be
required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business
with non-governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range
of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Intellectual Property Litigation

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's intellectual property litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Intellectual
Property Litigation.

Environmental Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's environmental matters, see Item 1. Business—Environmental Matters.

Asbestos Matters

Like many other companies, Tyco and some of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing
materials. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these
cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to
asbestos while on a subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution


of
heat-resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically
names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants.

Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because our subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in our experience, a large percentage of these claims were
never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. We will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and we have not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to
asbestos claims.

When
appropriate, we settle claims. However, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 30, 2004, there were
approximately 14,500 asbestos liability cases pending against us and our subsidiaries.

We
believe that we and our subsidiaries have substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles, with respect to asbestos claims. These
indemnitors and the relevant carriers typically have been honoring their duty to defend and indemnify. We believe that we have valid defenses to these claims and intend to continue to defend them
vigorously. Additionally, based on our historical experience in asbestos litigation and an analysis of our current cases, we believe that we have adequate amounts recorded for potential settlements
and adverse judgments in asbestos-related litigation. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, we believe that the
final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account our substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Tax Matters

Tyco and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax
authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. We are reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and are contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies.
Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision. We cannot provide
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these tax deficiencies and contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. It is not
expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to $500 million of permanently reinvested foreign
earnings in 2005 or 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. The Company is currently reviewing whether to take advantage of this new provision of the AJCA.

Other Matters

The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company
does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
new internal controls and procedures are implemented, any reported allegations or violations of our guide to ethical conduct are investigated and appropriate disciplinary and remedial
measures are taken. An allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non-U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004
revenue of


$40 million.
With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into these allegations and whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and records
of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC and are cooperating with their inquiry. We do not believe
this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Backlog

At September 30, 2004, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $13.2 billion, compared to a backlog of $11.3 billion at September 30,
2003. We expect that approximately 80% of our backlog at September 30, 2004 will be filled during 2005. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 30 is as follows ($ in
millions):



(1)

Fire and Security

$

6,726

$

6,782

Engineered Products and Services

3,469

2,025

Electronics

2,454

2,025

Healthcare



Plastics and Adhesives



Corporate and Other



$

(1)

During
the first quarter of 2004, our Precision Interconnect business was transferred from Healthcare to Electronics. In addition, the results of the TGN business held
for sale are presented within Corporate and Other. The Company has conformed its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period information to reflect these changes.

Within Fire and Security, backlog decreased primarily as a result of the sale of Sonitrol by ADT Security in the second quarter of 2004. Backlog
for Fire and Security includes recurring revenue-in-force, which represents twelve months' fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business.
The amount of recurring revenue-in-force at September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003 was $3,559 million and $3,607 million, respectively. Within
Engineered Products and Services, backlog increased primarily as a result of a $1.4 billion adjustment related to a change in how we classify sub-contract costs that are paid by
Infrastructure Services and re-billed to their customers. These costs have historically been treated as "pass through" and were therefore not previously included in reported revenue and
cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. During 2004, the Company began reflecting these subcontract costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. Within Electronics,
backlog increased primarily due to stronger orders resulting from an overall improvement in business conditions across the vast majority of its end markets. Backlog in Healthcare and Plastics and
Adhesives represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the businesses, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare and Plastics and
Adhesives to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sale of Accounts Receivable

Tyco has several programs under which it may sell participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and
security interests in those receivables. As collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sells new receivables. The Company has the risk of credit loss on the receivables
and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve has been retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to repay short-term and long-term
borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and are reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale proceeds are less than the face amount
of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates the cost that would be incurred if commercial paper were issued backed by these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is
accounted for as a loss on the sale of receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such discount aggregated
$18 million, $29 million, and $17 million, or 3.1%, 3.5%, and 2.7% of the weighted-average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable
programs by $929 million, of which $812 million relates to three of its corporate accounts receivable programs. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the availability under corporate
programs was $625 million and $1,025 million, respectively. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the Company further reduced the availability under these programs to
$550 million. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the amounts utilized under these programs was zero and $803 million, respectively. The remaining reduction related to certain of our
international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short-term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The aggregate amount outstanding under these
arrangements was $99 million and $202 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Variable Interest Entities

The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those
assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the
results of those entities but do not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN 46.

As
previously discussed, during 2003 the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN 46 for off-balance sheet accounting. In 2003 in conjunction with
adopting FIN 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure
Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto the Company's balance sheet effective
July 1, 2003, and were subsequently deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 upon the adoption of FIN 46R. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included in the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2003 were $96 million and $69 million, respectively.

Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2005 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for


nonperformance
under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, annual results of operations or cash
flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business—Environmental Matters for a discussion of
these liabilities.

The
Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2004 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which
is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on its estimate of fair value of the vessels (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations" above).

As
a result of exiting certain facilities as part of restructuring and acquisition plans, or otherwise, the Company continues to lease certain properties which it has vacated but has
sub-let to third parties. In the event the third parties vacate the premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the
financial risk of default by sub-lessors is not material, individually and in the aggregate, to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.


Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF Issue
No. 03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments." EITF 03-1 provides guidance on determining
other-than-temporary impairments and its application to marketable equity securities and debt securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") EITF Issue 03-1-1 which delayed the effective date for the
measurement and recognition guidance contained in the EITF 03-1 pending finalization of the draft FSP EITF Issue 03-1-a, "Implementation Guidance for the
Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF 03-1." The disclosure requirements of EITF 03-1 remain in effect. The Company adopted the disclosure requirement of EITF
03-1 as of September 30, 2004. The adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 (revised December 2003 as FIN 46R). FIN 46R further explains how to identify Variable Interest Entities ("VIE") and how to
determine when a business enterprise should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of VIE in its financial statements. The Company adopted FIN 46R as of March 31,
2004. As a result, the joint ventures that were previously consolidated under FIN 46 were deconsolidated effective March 31, 2004. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of the impact of FIN 46R.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," to improve financial statement
disclosure for defined benefit plans. This statement requires additional disclosures about the assets (including plan assets by category), obligations and cash flows of defined pension plans and other
defined benefit postretirement plans. It also requires reporting of various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. Generally, the disclosure requirements are
effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003; however, information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Tyco adopted the
revised SFAS No. 132 during the quarter ended March 31, 2004. See Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of retirement plans.

In
December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," which supercedes SAB 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."
SAB 104's primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21,
"Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The issuance of SAB 104 reflects the concepts contained in EITF 00-21. The other revenue recognition concepts contained in SAB 101 remain
largely unchanged. The issuance of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003." FSP No. 106-2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") on
postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. FSP No. 106-2 also requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the
Act. FSP No. 106-2 is effective for Tyco in the fourth quarter of 2004. The adoption of FSP No. 106-2 did not have a material impact on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

In
September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 04-8 "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share." This
EITF requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF
04-8 is effective for all


periods
ending after December 15, 2004 and requires retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. Any contingently convertible instrument that is settled in cash before
December 31, 2004 would not be reflected in the retroactive restatement. The adoption of this EITF is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "

Inventory Costs

, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS
No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials
(spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS
No. 151 will have on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows.


Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are
not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions,
geopolitical events and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our
liquidity.

Risks Relating to Actions of Tyco's Former Senior Corporate Management

Pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.

As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of our former senior corporate management, former members of our Board
of Directors and our current Chief Executive Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco,
certain of our current and former employees, some members of our former senior corporate management and some former members of our Board of Directors also are named as defendants in several ERISA
class actions. In addition, Tyco and some members of our former senior corporate management are subject to an SEC inquiry, and some members of our former senior corporate management are named as
defendants in criminal cases being prosecuted by the District Attorney of New York County. The findings and outcomes of the prosecutions and the SEC civil action may affect the course of the purported
securities class actions and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are also named as
defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses
and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments
or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
At this time, it is not possible to
estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Continued scrutiny resulting from ongoing governmental investigations may have an adverse effect on our business.

We and others have received subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the District Attorney of New York County, the Department of Labor and
others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. Certain current and former
employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices regarding the ADT dealer connect fees. As previously
reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of our benefit plans. We cannot predict when
these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on
future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non-governmental customers) or suffer other
penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot provide assurance that the effects and results of these or other investigations will not be material and
adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

Tyco and our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. Tyco is currently under audit by the IRS for the years 1997 to
2000. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. We are reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and are
contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been accrued
through the income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our
global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances;
however,
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.

In
connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997-2000, the Company prepared proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns. The proposed amendments are
currently being reviewed by the IRS and if accepted will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare
proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods.

Ongoing SEC inquiries may require us to further amend or restate our public disclosures.

We are subject to inquiries by the SEC's Division of Enforcement. We cannot provide assurance that the resolution of the Division of Enforcement's inquiries will
not necessitate further amendments or restatements to our previously-filed periodic reports or lead to some enforcement proceedings against Tyco. The SEC's Division of Enforcement has not completed
its review of prior management's actions and our accounting, including the matters covered by the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 30, 2002.

Further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls and procedures could have an adverse effect on us.

Management has determined that, in the past, Tyco in general suffered from:

•

poor
documentation;

•

inadequate
policies and procedures to prevent the misconduct of senior corporate executives;

•

inadequate
procedures for proper corporate authorizations;

•

inadequate
approval procedures and documentation;

•

a
lack of oversight by senior management at the corporate level;

•

a
pattern of using aggressive accounting that, even when in accordance with GAAP, was intended to increase reported earnings above what they would have been if more
conservative accounting had been employed;

•

pressure
on, and inducements to, segment and unit managers to increase current earnings, including decisions as to what accounting treatment to employ; and

•

a
lack of a stated and demonstrable commitment by former senior corporate management to set high standards of ethics, integrity, accounting, and corporate governance.


While
we have implemented new procedures, we cannot provide assurance that we will not discover that there have been further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls and procedures.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.

We estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the forseeable future. In
making this estimate, we have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with our pending litigation or investigations. Any material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or
settlements arising from our pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we
will be able to obtain the additional
funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Such
an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

require
us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, including debt reduction or dividend payments;

•

increase
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict
our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;

•

make
it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and

•

increase
the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.

Additional negative publicity may adversely affect our business.

As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco was the subject of continuing negative publicity focusing on these actions. This
negative publicity contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities in 2002 and brought increased regulatory scrutiny
upon us. Additional negative publicity related to former senior corporate management's actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and the market price of
our publicly traded securities.

Our senior corporate management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management.

We replaced our senior corporate executives with a new team during 2002 through 2004, and all of the former members of our Board of Directors determined not to
stand for reelection in March 2003. A new Board of Directors was elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2003. We cannot provide assurance that this major
restructuring of our Board of Directors and senior management team, and the accompanying distractions related to matters arising from the actions of prior management will not adversely affect our
results of operations.


Risks Relating to Our Businesses

Cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our

financial condition and results of operations.

Our
operating results in some of our segments are affected adversely by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which they operate. For example, demand for the products and
services of Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending. Also, the electronic
components business within Electronics is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand and capital investment patterns of these markets, which could
impact the margins in this business. This cyclical impact can be amplified because some of our businesses purchase products from other of our businesses. For example, Fire and Security purchases
certain products sold by Engineered Products and Services. Therefore, a drop in demand for our fire prevention products due to lower new residential or office construction or other factors can cause a
drop in demand for certain of our products sold by Engineered Products and Services.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:

•

the
generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions
or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the
health and safety of our employees.

There
can be no assurances that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators. For example, on August 17, 2004, one of our subsidiaries in Electronics was sentenced for Clean Water Act violations at three of its manufacturing plants in
Connecticut, pursuant to which it paid a $6 million fine and an additional $4 million to fund environmental projects designed to improve the environment for local residents. See
Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Environmental Litigation.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances and costs to restore natural resources. In addition to cleanup costs resulting from environmental laws, private parties could bring
personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored or disposed of by us or contained in our products.

We
have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, certain foreign and state environmental agencies, and some third parties that conditions at a number of sites where we
and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites
and/or for natural resource damages. We also have a number of projects underway at several of our current and former manufacturing facilities in order to comply with environmental laws or otherwise
remediate environmental contamination. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including:

•

radioactive
materials decontamination and decommissioning;

•

solvent,
metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and

•

oil
spill equipment upgrades and replacement.


These
projects, some of which are voluntary and some of which are required under applicable law, involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for
certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us.

The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and
alternative cleanup methods. We have concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $167 million to $443 million. We concluded that the
best estimate within this range is approximately $265 million, of which $42 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $223 million is included in other
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2004. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have
budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection
and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.

We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.

Pursuant to GAAP, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired.
Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating
results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges to goodwill and other asset impairments. Future impairment charges could substantially
affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge. In addition, such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders' equity, increasing our
debt-to-total-capitalization ratio. Such reduction in consolidated net worth and increase in debt as a percentage of total capitalization could result in a default under our
credit facilities.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. See
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our
net revenue derived from sales in non-U.S. markets for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 47.4%, 45.0% and 41.8%, respectively, and we expect revenue from non-U.S.
markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell our
products, such as the Euro, our U.S. Dollar-reported revenue and income will decrease. changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a
significant effect on our results of operations. Our financial statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. Dollars, our functional currency.

We
are a large buyer of steel and resin in the United States. We are also a large buyer of other commodities, including copper, brass, gold, paper, pulp and cotton. Volatility in the
prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and cash flows.


We
monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we purchase hedges or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations
from these fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property
rights, litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior and product liability litigation. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful
plaintiffs to recover treble damages. In addition, our Healthcare business is subject to regulation and potential litigation. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and
we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that
could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our Healthcare business is subject to extensive regulation by the government and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products. Failure to comply with
current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product
manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls,
withdrawals or declining sales.

Our ADT business has generally experienced higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and has caused us to change the useful life of accounts, increasing our depreciation
and amortization expense.

Attrition rates for customers in our global electronic security services business were 15.1%, 15.9% and 13.2% on a trailing 12-month basis as of
September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. If attrition rates show an upward trend, ADT's recurring revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected. Tyco amortizes the costs
of ADT's contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the ADT dealer program using a double-declining balance method based on a ten-year life for the first eight years of
the estimated life of the customer relationships, converting to the straight-line method of amortization to completely amortize the asset pool by the end of the twelfth year. Internally
generated residential and commercial account pools are amortized using a straight-line method over ten to fourteen years. If the attrition rates were to rise for these account pools, then
Tyco may be required to accelerate the
amortization of the costs related to these pools, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by reckless or corrupt behavior by any of our employees or agents or those of our subsidiaries.

Tyco and its subsidiaries operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, including, but not limited to, Asia,
Latin America and Eastern Europe. Tyco's policy mandates strict compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials.
Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or


criminal
acts committed by our employees that would violate the U.S. and/or foreign laws governing payments to government officials. These actions could result in criminal or civil penalties,
including substantial monetary fines, against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.

An
allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non-U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004
revenue of $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into these allegations and whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books
and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC and are cooperating with their inquiry.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
and minimum levels of net worth, and other covenants that limit our ability to pledge assets and to make substantial payments in connection with our capital shares. We have synthetic lease facilities
with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback
transactions.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all
commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities
and our other indebtedness. Acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations. See
Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Downgrades of our debt ratings would adversely affect us.

Certain downgrades by Moody's and S&P would permit the providers of our receivables facilities, to the extent that our receivables facilities are utilized, to
cease further purchases under the facilities and would increase the interest cost of our credit facility borrowings. Downgrades may also increase our cost of capital and make it more difficult for us
to obtain new financing.

Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislation and negative publicity regarding Bermuda companies could increase our tax burden and

affect our operating results.

Legislation Relating to Government Contracts

We continue to assess the potential impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their corporate location abroad. The legislative proposals could cover the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited (a public company that
had been located in Bermuda since the 1980's with origins dating back to the United Kingdom since the early 1900's), as a result of which ADT changed its name to Tyco International Ltd. and
became the parent to the Tyco group.


In
2003, the State of California adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain Bermuda and other foreign-chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts.
To date Tyco companies have requested waivers which have been granted or are still pending with only one request having been denied. However, there is no reliable process for how that waiver authority
will be exercised and how the provision for such waivers will affect Tyco's business.

In
addition, the U.S. federal government and various other states and municipalities have proposed or may propose legislation that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict with any level of certainty the likelihood or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of
regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the impact such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.

Tyco's
revenues related to direct sales to the U.S. federal government and the State of California accounted for less than 2.0% and 0.1%, respectively, of our total net revenues for
2004. We are unable to predict, however, whether the final form of the proposed legislation discussed above would also affect Tyco's indirect sales to the U.S. federal or state governments or the
willingness of Tyco's non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact on us of any proposed legislation
in this area and can provide no assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse.

Tax Legislation

The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation affecting the tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation
transactions. Recently, the U.S. Congress enacted such legislation, which did not, however, retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd. by ADT Limited. We expect
various tax proposals to be introduced in the U.S. Congress in the future and cannot provide assurance that these proposals would not have adverse effects on Tyco if enacted. Such adverse effects
could include substantially reducing the tax benefits of our corporate structure, materially increasing our tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our business.

Negative Publicity

There is continuing negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, U.S. companies' use of, or relocation to, offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. As a
Bermuda company, this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of the
negative public image of Bermuda companies
or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a Bermuda company.

Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Bermuda. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Bermuda based on the
civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts
obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
We have been advised that the United States and Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore,
a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any


U.S.
federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Bermuda.

As
a Bermuda company, Tyco is governed by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and
shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of
a Bermuda company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies do not generally have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may only
exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company in limited circumstances. Under Bermuda law, a company may also agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability, not
involving fraud or dishonesty, incurred in relation to the company. Thus, holders of Tyco securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a
corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

potential distraction costs associated with negative publicity relating to actions of our former senior corporate management.


Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our
more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material
changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2005.

We
utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross-border transactions and anticipated
non-functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial
instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate
swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows of principal repayment and weighted-average interest rates. For interest rate and cross-currency swaps, the table presents notional amounts
at the current market price rate and weighted average interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. The amounts included in the
table below are in U.S. Dollars, unless noted ($ in millions):

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

The information required by Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) has previously been reported by the Company. There have been no disagreements with our accountants, as
defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(b).

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

On September 17, 2002 and December 30, 2002 we reported in Current Reports on Form 8-K the findings of outside counsel investigations that
identified internal control weaknesses in our accounting and financial reporting. These findings have played a significant role in our efforts to strengthen our internal control environment in such
areas as acquisition accounting, restructuring, financial and legal controls, reserve utilization, incentive compensation and a number of other areas relevant to our financial statements. Tyco's
senior management and Board of Directors continue their comprehensive, diligent efforts in reviewing Tyco's internal controls and policies and procedures. These efforts have been enhanced and expanded
as a result of our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOx 404"), which have not yet been completed. Although the framework has been


put
in place to materially improve the control structure of Tyco, it will take some time to realize all of the benefits from our initiatives.

Senior
management is committed to continuing to improve our corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting. During 2003 and 2004, our Board of Directors and senior
management initiated the following actions:

•

Created
new Board and Board Committee charters;

•

Created
a new employee Guide to Ethical Conduct, began a planned, targeted training on certain identified risk areas and conducted worldwide employee meetings to train
employees;

•

Established
company-wide compliance training;

•

Chartered
a new Compliance Risk Committee;

•

Instituted
detailed operating and strategy reviews with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and each business segment;

•

Realigned
reporting such that the business segment chief financial officers and general counsels report directly to our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel,
respectively, and instituted similar reporting within each business segment;

•

Reviewed
total incentive compensation spending with the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors;

•

Created
a detailed delegation of authority to govern, among other business processes, the expenditure or commitment of funds;

•

Developed
a controllership guide to provide guidance on applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States;

•

Required
internal representation letters, similar to the certifications by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, for key general manager and financial and
legal executives;

•

Instituted
a code of conduct for all financial executives;

•

Developed
a corporate policy manual to provide broadly applicable and consistent direction on authority, procedures and accountability with respect to business operations;

•

Instituted
an account reconciliation process to improve controls over core accounting records;

•

Created
an Ombudsman office;

•

Conducted
intensified internal audits, and detailed controls and operating reviews;

•

Developed
treasury department policies and procedures and a related training program;

•

Conducted
a thorough review of internal audit processes and procedures and expanded the resources and responsibilities of the internal audit function, including a senior
internal audit officer who reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors;

•

Created
a disclosure committee that is comprised of a cross-functional team, including, but not limited to, senior personnel from the legal, finance, internal audit and
corporate governance departments with responsibility for reviewing Tyco's periodic SEC filings for adequacy of disclosure and communicating material findings to the Company's Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer;

•

Hired
a new Chief Accounting Officer;


•

Developed
a formal fraud risk assessment process during the fourth quarter of 2004 that will be rolled out during 2005, whereby our finance and operational leaders will
review their businesses for susceptibility to fraud and make appropriate changes to internal controls; and

•

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, began implementing substantial changes to the tax reporting and compliance processes, including preparation of amended federal U.S. income
tax returns, hiring and training of additional tax personnel and the completion of a comprehensive review, analysis and reconciliation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

In
connection with our SOx 404 compliance efforts, we have invested significant resources in documenting, analyzing and testing our internal controls. As necessary, we have taken, and
currently continue to take actions to remediate control gaps identified including additional information technology controls, improved segregation of duties, predominantly in our smaller entities,
further formalization of our controllership guide, extensive training on generally accepted accounting principles and internal controls and enhanced monitoring controls. We are committed to ongoing
assessments of our controls and their effectiveness, the results of which will be reported to our shareholders.

Senior
management believes based on its knowledge that the financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. We cannot provide assurance that new problems will not be found in the
future. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud because no control system can provide absolute assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within Tyco have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some person or by collusion of two or more people. We expect to continue to improve our controls with each passing
quarter. Our Board of Directors and senior management are committed not only to a sound internal control environment but also to be recognized as a leader in corporate governance.

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Tyco's disclosure controls and procedures by senior
management. Based on that evaluation, Tyco's management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that these disclosure procedures and controls are effective. Except as described above, there have been no
significant changes in internal controls. Tyco will continue to make ongoing assessments of these controls and procedures.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discussion of Management's Responsibility

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in this report.
We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to being recognized as a leader in governance, controls, clarity and transparency of financial statements. We are committed to making
honesty, integrity and transparency the hallmarks of how we run Tyco. We believe that to succeed in today's environment requires more than just compliance with laws and regulations—it
requires a culture based upon the highest levels of integrity and ethical values. Expected behavior starts with our Board of Directors and our senior team leading by example and includes every one of
Tyco's 258,400 global employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and business partners. One of our most crucial objectives is continuing to restore public, employee and shareholder confidence in
Tyco. We believe this is being accomplished; first, by issuing financial information and related disclosures that are accurate, complete and transparent so investors are well informed; second, by
supporting a leadership culture based on an ethic of uncompromising integrity and accountability; and third, by recruiting, training and retaining high-performance individuals who have the
highest ethical standards. We take full responsibility for meeting this objective, adopting appropriate accounting standards, designing and maintaining adequate systems of internal and disclosure
controls and devoting our full commitment and the necessary resources to these items.

Dedication to Governance, Controls and Financial Reporting

Throughout 2004, we continued to make significant progress designing, maintaining and monitoring internal controls over financial reporting and disclosures and
improving our corporate governance practices, many of which are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that a strong control environment is a dynamic process.
Therefore, we intend to continue to devote substantial resources to document, assess and improve our internal controls and corporate governance, and we believe that the controls currently in place
provide reasonable assurance that our assets are safeguarded, transactions are in accordance with authorizations and that financial records are reliable for our financial statements.

We
are pleased with our corporate governance and control improvements; however, we still have more to accomplish in a dynamic and quite complex environment before we are fully confident
that we have in place all of the rigorous and effective controls that we and our Board of Directors desire.

Our
Audit Committee meets regularly and separately with management, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors, and our internal auditors to discuss financial reports,
controls and auditing.

We,
our Board and our Audit Committee are all committed to excellence in governance, financial reporting and controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule for the year ended September 30, 2004, listed in the Index
at Item 15a. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the 2004 consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2004, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

To
the Board of Directors

and Shareholders of Tyco International Ltd.

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Tyco International Ltd. and its subsidiaries at September 30, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended September 30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2003 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation—

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco
International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Tyco") and have
been prepared in United States Dollars, and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP").

Principles of Consolidation—

Tyco is a holding company which conducts its business through its operating subsidiaries. The
Company is a global, diversified company that provides products and services in five business segments: Fire and Security, Electronics, Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services and Plastics and
Adhesives (see Note 23). The Company consolidates companies in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares unless control is likely to be temporary. Also, the Company
consolidates variable interest entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities' potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. While the Company presents its results of operations as of a September 30 year end, certain subsidiaries consistently close
their books up to one month prior to that closing date. The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date
of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition—

The Company recognizes revenue principally on four types of transactions—sales of products,
sales of security systems, subscriber billings for monitoring services and contract sales.

Revenue
from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass. This is generally when the products reach the
free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonable assured.

Provisions
for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in determining sales in the same
period the related sales are recorded. These provisions are based on estimates derived from current program requirements and historical experience.

Sales
of security monitoring systems include multiple components including installation. Amounts assigned to each component are based on that component's objectively determined fair
value. If fair value cannot be objectively determined for a sale involving multiple elements, the Company recognizes the revenue from installation of services, along with the associated direct
incremental costs, over the contract life.

Revenue
from the sale of services is recognized as services are rendered. Subscriber billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are
rendered, and the associated deferred revenue is included in current liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

Contract
sales for the installation of fire protection systems, undersea fiber optic cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to completion. Cost to completion is
measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current
period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable.


In
providing services under certain contracts, Infrastructure Services (a business unit within Engineered Products and Services) incurs sub-contract and other costs that are
paid by Infrastructure Services and re-billed to their customers. These costs have historically been treated as "pass through" and were therefore not included in reported revenue and cost
of revenue of Infrastructure Services. Effective January 1, 2004, retroactive to October 1, 2003, the Company began reflecting these sub-contract costs in both revenue and
cost of revenue for Infrastructure Services, resulting in incremental revenue and cost of revenue of $739 million for the year ended September 30, 2004. The Company has not adjusted
revenue or cost of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 as such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no impact on previously reported operating
income, net income (loss) or cash flow.

Certain
of the Company's long-term contracts have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based on the contract terms and technology
specific issues. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion
accounting.

The
Company's global undersea fiber optic network, on which it sells bandwidth capacity, is known as the Tyco Global Network ("TGN"). The Company's sales of bandwidth capacity are
generally structured as either service arrangements or operating leases. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the service arrangement ratably over the service period and recognizes revenue
associated with the operating leases over the lease term. The Company plans to sell the TGN (see Note 28).

At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable and other long-term receivables included retainage provisions of $86 million and $122 million,
respectively, of which $34 million and $54 million are unbilled, respectively. These retainage provisions consist primarily of electronics contracts, fire protection contracts as well as
transportation, water and environmental-related contracts and become due upon contract completion and acceptance. At September 30, 2004 the retainage provision included $57 million,
which is expected to be collected during 2005. In addition, at September 30, 2004 and 2003, $48 million and $47 million, respectively, of accounts receivable were unbilled related
to long-term contracts.

Research and Development

—Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of sales.
Customer-funded research and development are costs incurred by Tyco that are reimbursed by customers. There is no net impact on research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations for customer-funded research and development. Research and development expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations reflects company-sponsored research and development only.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Employee Share Option Plans

—Tyco measures compensation cost in connection with employee share option plans using the intrinsic
value method and accordingly does not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price at the date of grant. Had the fair
value based method been applied by Tyco, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions set forth in Note 21, the effect on net income (loss) and


earnings
(loss) per share for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have been as follows ($ in millions, except per share data):

Translation of Foreign Currency—

For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that account in a functional currency
other than U.S. Dollars and do not operate in highly inflationary environments, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
within shareholders' equity. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are translated at the rate of
exchange in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments for the assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are included in net income.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, the amounts of which are not material in any period presented, are included in net income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—All highly liquid investments purchased with maturity of three months or less from the time of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

On
occasion, the Company is required to post cash collateral to secure reimbursements or indemnity obligations under letters of credit and performance guarantees in respect of various
construction projects. The amount of restricted cash in collateral was $84 million (of which $30 million is included in current assets and $54 million is included in
long-term assets) and $445 million (of which $142 million is included in current assets and $303 million is included in long-term assets) at
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses
inherent in Tyco's receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Inventories—

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market
value.


Property, Plant and Equipment, Net—

Property, plant and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $1,478 million, $1,459 million and $1,454 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair
expenditures are charged to expense when incurred. For the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company capitalized interest of $2 million, $25 million and
$100 million, respectively. The high level of capitalized interest in 2002 is due to the construction of the TGN. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

Remaining term of the lease

Subscriber systems

10 to 14 years

Other machinery, equipment and furniture and fixtures

2 to 20 years

The
Company generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer
accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. Subscriber systems represent internally generated residential systems and internally generated commercial systems (customer accounts acquired through
the ADT dealer program are recorded as intangible assets). For internal purposes, the Company considers internally generated commercial accounts in three smaller groups consisting of small business,
core commercial and national commercial accounts. The internally generated residential and commercial account pools are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a
ten-year period (a fourteen-year period is used for national commercial accounts and a fourteen-year period with write-off of specific accounts upon
discontinuance is used for residential and commercial accounts in certain non-U.S. geographic locations).

Long-Lived Assets

—The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets,
including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash
flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the
underlying business. An impairment in the carrying value of an asset is recognized whenever anticipated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
The net book value of an asset is adjusted to fair value if its expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than book value. The amount of the impairment recognized is the difference between the
carrying value of the asset and its fair value. Fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying
degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill

—Effective October 1, 2001, the beginning of Tyco's fiscal year 2002, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," under which goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually and
as triggering events occur. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and
transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.


The
Company has elected to make July 1 the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. SFAS No. 142 defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one
level below an operating segment. Our reporting units as of September 30, 2004 were as follows: Electronic Security Services, Fire Protection Contracting and Services, Electronic Components,
Wireless, Electrical Contracting Services, Power Systems, Printed Circuit Group, Submarine Telecommunications, Medical Devices & Supplies, Retail, Pharmaceuticals, Flow Control and Fire
Products, Electrical and Metal Products, Infrastructure Services, Plastics, A&E Products, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products. When changes occur in the composition of one or more segments or
reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the segments or reporting units affected based on their relative fair value as prescribed by SFAS No. 142.

Goodwill
valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions
including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods.

Disruptions
to the business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a
significant component of a reporting unit, and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform
a SFAS No. 142 first step valuation analysis for some or all of Tyco's reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in
additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in the future.

See
Note 13 for more information on SFAS No. 142 and Note 4 for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill relating to Tyco Capital.

Intangible Assets, Net

—Intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer relationships, and intellectual
property. Certain contracts and related customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the
ADT dealer program. Acquired contracts and related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price. In those instances where the Company incurs costs associated
with maintaining and operating its ADT dealer program, including brand advertising and due diligence. In certain programs, dealers pay the Company a non-refundable amount for each of the
contracts sold to the Company. This non-refundable charge represents dealer reimbursement to the Company for costs incurred by the Company associated with maintaining and operating the ADT
dealer program. Accordingly, each acquired contract and related customer relationship was recorded at its contractually determined purchase price, net of a non-refundable amount charged to
dealers at the time the contract was accepted for purchase.

During
the first six months (twelve months in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from
customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The non-refundable charge to the dealer is retained
by the Company even in the event of customer cancellation. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset.

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program described above are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and
pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Based upon attrition


studies
of the ADT dealer program customer base, conducted by an independent appraiser, the Company believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective above is
the double-declining balance method based on a ten-year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationship, converting to the straight-line
method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated
method of amortization described above.

Other
contracts and related customer relationships, as well as intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology, are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over five to forty years. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant
a revision to the remaining useful life. In addition, intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

Investments

—The Company invests in equity and debt securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity
securities that represent less than twenty percent ownership are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to other comprehensive
income within shareholders' equity for available for sale securities unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management
determines the proper classification of investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and
reevaluates such classifications as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Other
equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that they are recorded at the
lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.

For
equity investments in which the Company owns or controls twenty percent or more of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant influence over operating and financial
policies, the equity method of accounting is used. The Company's share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and was not material in
any period presented.

Restricted Investments

—Restricted investments consist of fixed income securities with maturities in excess of three months
that are restricted because they are currently held as collateral for certain insurance obligations.

Product Warranty

—The Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. Manufactured products are
warranted against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Generally, product warranties are implicit in
the sale; however, the customer may purchase an extended warranty. Manufactured equipment is also warranted in the same manner as product warranties. However, in


most
instances the warranty is either negotiated in the contract or sold as a separate component. Warranty period terms range from 90 days (e.g., consumable products) up to 20 years
(e.g., power system batteries.) The warranty liability is determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of
material and labor, and in certain instances estimated property damage.

Environmental Costs

—Tyco is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Tyco provides for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company discounts environmental liabilities using a risk-free rate
of return when the obligation is fixed or reliably determinable. The impact of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2004 and 2003 was to reduce the obligation by
$20 million and $17 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

—Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book values and the tax bases of particular assets and
liabilities and operating loss carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets
if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Insurable Liabilities

—The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities up
to pre-determined program deductibles subsequent to which the risk of loss is transferred to the Company's insurance carriers. The determination of these liabilities and related expenses
is dependent on claims experience. For certain of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience.
Certain insurance liabilities are discounted using a risk-free rate of return when the obligation is reliably determinable. The impact of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
September 30, 2004 and 2003 was to reduce the obligation by $45 million and $32 million, respectively.

Financial Instruments

—All derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
Changes in a derivative financial instrument's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. At its inception, if the derivative financial instrument is
designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative
financial instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings.

Fair
value estimates are based on relevant market information, including current market rates and prices, assuming adequate market liquidity. Fair value estimates for interest rate and
cross-currency swaps are calculated by the Company or are provided to the Company by high-quality, third-party financial institutions known to be high volume participants in this market.

The
Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company's objective for utilizing derivatives is to manage these
risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. For those transactions that are designated as hedges, the Company documents relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, and links derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to specific
firm commitments or


forecasted
transactions. For transactions designated as hedges, the Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates, the Company enters into various interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties. To ensure both appropriate use as a hedge and hedge accounting treatment, all derivatives entered into are designated according to a hedge objective against specified liabilities such
as a specifically underwritten debt issue. The Company's primary hedge objectives include the conversion of fixed-rate liabilities to variable rates. The derivative financial instruments
associated with these objectives are classified as fair value hedges.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes forward and option contracts with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties. The objective of these hedging contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans, booked accounts and notes
receivable and accounts payable, and forecasted transactions. Only in very limited circumstances is hedge accounting designated. The remaining hedges are marked to market.

The
Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as Tyco deals with a variety of
major banks worldwide with long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments are utilized
thereby affording optimum clarity as to the market risk. None of the Company's derivative financial instruments outstanding at
year end would result in a significant loss to the Company if a counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, the Company does not require collateral or other
security to be furnished by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments.

Share Premium and Contributed Surplus

—In accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, when Tyco issues shares for cash at a
premium to their par value, the resulting premium is credited to a share premium account, a non-distributable reserve. When Tyco issues shares in exchange for shares of another company,
the excess of the fair value of the shares acquired over the par value of the shares issued by Tyco is credited, where applicable, to contributed surplus, which is, subject to certain conditions, a
distributable reserve.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses. Significant estimates in these Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges and credits, acquisition liabilities, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable,
estimates of future cash flows associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, fair values of financial
instruments, estimated contract revenue and related costs, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and tax valuation reserves, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions
for pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in results of operations in the period that the
event or circumstances giving rise to such changes occur.


Reclassifications

—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation, the most
significant of which are deferred taxes and discontinued operations.

Accounting Pronouncements

—In November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments." EITF 03-1 provides guidance on determining other-than-temporary impairments and its application to marketable equity securities and debt securities accounted for under SFAS
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") EITF Issue 03-1-1
which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in the EITF 03-1 pending finalization of the draft FSP EITF Issue 03-1-a,
"Implementation Guidance for the Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF 03-1." The disclosure requirements of EITF 03-1 remain in effect. The Company adopted the disclosure
requirements of EITF 03-1 as of September 30, 2004. The adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 are not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (revised December 2003 as FIN 46R). FIN 46R further
explains how to identify Variable Interest Entities ("VIE") and how to determine when a business enterprise should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of VIE in its
financial statements. The Company adopted FIN 46R as of March 31, 2004. As a result, the joint ventures that were previously consolidated under FIN 46 were deconsolidated effective
March 31, 2004. See Note 9 for further discussion of the impact of FIN 46R.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," to improve financial statement
disclosure for defined benefit plans. This statement requires additional disclosures about the assets (including plan assets by category), obligations and cash flows of defined pension plans and other
defined benefit postretirement plans. It also requires reporting of various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. Generally, the disclosure requirements are
effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003; however, information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Tyco adopted the
revised SFAS No. 132 during the quarter ended March 31, 2004. See Note 19 for further discussion of retirement plans.

In
December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," which supercedes SAB 101, "Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 104's primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the
issuance of EITF 00-21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The issuance of SAB 104 reflects the concepts contained in EITF 00-21. The other
revenue recognition concepts contained in SAB 101 remain largely unchanged. The issuance of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003." FSP No. 106-2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") on
postretirement health care plans that provide


prescription
drug benefits. FSP No. 106-2 also requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act. FSP No. 106-2 is
effective for Tyco in the fourth quarter of 2004. The adoption of FSP No. 106-2 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In
September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 04-8 "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share". This
EITF requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF
04-8 is effective for all periods ending after December 15, 2004 and requires retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. Any contingently convertible
instrument that is settled in cash before December 31, 2004 would not be reflected in the retroactive restatement. The adoption of this EITF is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "

Inventory Costs

, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS
No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials
(spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS
No. 151 will have on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

3.    Charges for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

2004 Charges

During 2004, the Company recorded total charges for the impairment of long-lived assets held for use in continuing operations of $99 million.
Plastics and Adhesives recorded charges for the impairment of property, plant and equipment of $47 million related to the Company's decision to close certain facilities as discussed in
Note 2. Fire and Security recorded charges of $34 million primarily related to the write-down of a United States facility to its estimated fair value, and to a lesser extent,
to the write-off of cash management software. In addition, Corporate, Engineered Products and Services, Electronics and Healthcare recorded combined charges of $18 million related
to the impairment of property, plant and equipment.

2003 Charges

During 2003, the Company recorded total charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $825 million.

Fire
and Security recorded charges for the impairment of intangible assets of $101 million resulting from the further deterioration of future estimated cash flows anticipated from
customers primarily in Mexico and certain Latin American countries following the curtailment, and in some instances, the termination of the ADT dealer program in these countries. In addition,
$11 million of impairment charges were recorded related to the discontinuance of two brand names. Fire and Security also recorded charges for the impairment of property, plant and equipment of
$21 million related primarily to subscriber systems and other fixed assets, as well as $10 million associated with the termination of a software development project.

The
Company recorded charges for the impairment of property, plant and equipment of $679 million at Corporate, of which $664 million related to the impairment of the TGN
which was classified as held for sale. This impairment was recorded to write-off the entire TGN as a result of our intention to divest this business. The amount of the impairment was based upon
estimates of its fair value, less costs to dispose. The remaining $15 million charge primarily related to the closure and relocation of corporate offices.

In
addition, other impairment charges of $2 million and $1 million that were recorded at Engineered Products and Services and Electronics, respectively.


2002 Charges

During 2002, the Company recorded total charges for the impairment of long-lived assets in continuing operations of $3,310 million.

Fire
and Security recorded a charge of $6 million related to the impairment of intangible assets resulting from the curtailment, and in certain markets, the termination of the ADT
dealer program. In addition, Fire and Security recorded a charge of $109 million primarily related to the impairment of
property, plant and equipment associated with the termination of a software development project. The software development project related to a strategy to develop a new comprehensive integrated
customer database and associated applications for this segment and its acquired companies. During 2002, management, with the assistance of a third-party consultant, performed a full evaluation to
determine the information technology needs of the Fire and Security business relative to where it stood then and expectations for it over the near future. As a result of this review, the Company
decided to abandon the project, which was still in the development and testing stage, resulting in the write-off of capitalized costs.

Electronics
recorded a charge of $569 million, of which $541 million primarily related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment related to the closure of
facilities as discussed in Note 2 and $28 million related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with undersea systems technology and know-how acquired through
acquisitions.

The
Company recorded a charge of $2,611 million at Corporate, of which $2,582 million related to the impairment of the TGN, and $29 million related to the impairment
of certain corporate properties associated with the consolidation of corporate headquarters discussed in Note 2.

During
2002, the fiber optic capacity available in the market significantly exceeded overall market demand, which created sharply declining prices and reduced anticipated future cash
flows for the TGN. As a result, the Company assessed the carrying value of the TGN assuming a held and used model applying an analysis that employed estimates as to current and future market pricing,
demand and network completion costs. This analysis was highly sensitive to changes in these estimates. Based upon these estimates, the Company concluded that the value of its fiber optic network was
partially impaired and consequently recorded an impairment charge during the quarter ended March 31, 2002. The amount of the impairment was based upon the difference between the carrying value
of each asset group and the estimated fair value of those assets groups as of March 31, 2002. The estimated fair value of each asset group was determined using an income (discounted cash flow)
approach. The cash flow forecasts were prepared using the 15-year estimated weighted-average useful life of each of the TGN asset groups. Probability factors were applied to various
scenarios weighting the likelihood of each possible outcome. Then, each cash flow forecast was discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital of 15%. Based upon these analyses, the sum of the
expected future discounted cash flows was subtracted from the carrying values of the asset groups resulting in an impairment loss for the TGN. The entire TGN placed in service as of March 31,
2002 was written-off at that time, as well as a portion of TGN construction in progress. The Company reconsidered the factors noted above, such as projected operating results, business plans and an
estimate of discounted future cash flows, in order to retest the carrying value of the TGN for a further impairment at June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002. The Company determined that
no impairment charge was necessary at June 30, 2002. However, the further decline in the telecommunications industry necessitated an additional impairment charge and, therefore, a charge was
recorded as of September 30, 2002.


Engineered
Products and Services, Plastics and Adhesives, and Healthcare recorded charges of $10 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively, related to the
impairment of property, plant and equipment associated with the closure of facilities discussed in Note 2.

4.    Divestitures and Discontinued Operations

2004 Activity

During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments of divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or
write-down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. In addition, the Company also recorded losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million
($123 million after tax) to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value.

During
2003, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. In connection with this program, the
Company divested twenty-one and liquidated four non-core businesses across all business segments except Plastics and Adhesives and primarily within Fire and Security for aggregate proceeds
of $252 million in cash, of which $16 million of the proceeds are currently held in escrow. Total assets and total liabilities of the divested businesses were $445 million and
$115 million, respectively. Total assets include cash retained by the businesses sold of $13 million.

Net
revenue and net loss for 2004 through the date of disposition were $460 million and $43 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet the criteria for
discontinued operations. Net revenue and net income for the year ended September 30, 2003 were $587 million and $24 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet
the criteria for discontinued operations.

Net
revenue of 2004 discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $889 million, $815 million and $766 million,
respectively. Pretax (loss) income of these discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $(135) million, $7 million and $19 million,
respectively.

2003 Activity

During 2003, Tyco recorded income from discontinued operations of $20 million for a restitution payment made by Frank E. Walsh Jr., a former
director (see Note 14).

2002 Activity

During 2002, the Company sold certain of its businesses for net proceeds of $139 million in cash that consisted primarily of businesses within Healthcare
and Fire and Security. In connection with these dispositions, the Company recorded a net gain of $24 million, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

On
July 8, 2002, the Company divested Tyco Capital (CIT Group Inc.) through the sale of 100% of the common shares of CIT Group Inc. ("CIT"), its principal operating
subsidiary, in an initial public offering ("IPO"). Accordingly, the results of Tyco Capital are presented as discontinued operations. Operating results from the discontinued operations of Tyco Capital
from October 1, 2001 through July 8, 2002 were $3.3 billion of finance income, $6.0 billion of pre-tax loss and $6.3 billion of net loss. The net loss
includes a goodwill impairment charge of $6,638 million.

During
the quarter ended March 31, 2002, Tyco experienced disruptions to its business surrounding its announced break-up plan, a downgrade in its credit ratings, and a
significant decline in its market capitalization. During this same time period, CIT also experienced credit downgrades and a disruption to its historical funding base. Further, market-based
information developed in connection with the Company's preliminary consideration of the proposed IPO of CIT indicated that CIT's book value exceeded its estimated fair value as of March 31,
2002. As a result, the Company performed a SFAS No. 142 first step goodwill impairment analysis as of March 31, 2002 and concluded that an impairment charge was warranted at that time.

Management's
objective in performing the first step goodwill impairment analysis was to obtain relevant market-based data to calculate the estimated fair value of CIT as of
March 31, 2002 based on its projected earnings and market factors expected to be used by market participants in ascribing value to CIT in the planned separation of CIT from Tyco. Management
obtained relevant market data from financial advisors regarding the range of price to earnings multiples and market condition discounts applicable to CIT as of March 31, 2002 and applied these
market data to CIT's projected annual earnings as of March 31, 2002 to calculate an estimated fair value and any resulting goodwill impairment. The estimated fair value was compared to the
corresponding carrying value of CIT at March 31, 2002. As a result, the Company recorded a $4,513 million impairment charge as of March 31, 2002, which is included in discontinued
operations.

A
second step goodwill impairment analysis is required whenever a reporting unit's book value exceeds estimated fair value. This analysis required the Company to estimate the fair value
of the reporting unit's individual assets and liabilities to complete the analysis of goodwill as of March 31, 2002. The Company completed this second step analysis for CIT during the quarter
ended June 30, 2002 and, as a result, recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $132 million. During the June 30, 2002 quarter, CIT experienced further credit
downgrades and the business environment and other factors continued to negatively impact the likely proceeds of the IPO. As a result, the Company performed another first step and second step analysis
as of June 30, 2002 in a manner consistent with the March 2002 process described above. Each of these analyses was based upon updated market data


at
June 30, 2002 and through the period immediately following the IPO, including the IPO proceeds. These analyses resulted in a goodwill impairment of $1,867 million. Tyco also recorded
an additional impairment charge of $126 million in order to write-down its investment in CIT to fair value for a total CIT goodwill impairment of $2,125 million. This
write-down was based upon net IPO proceeds of approximately $4.4 billion, after deducting estimated out-of-pocket expenses, and is included in the
$6,283 million loss from discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Tyco recorded a loss on the sale of Tyco Capital of $59 million.

5.    Acquisitions

Acquisitions

During 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of 2 businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of
$9 million. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

During
2003, the Company purchased seven businesses within Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, Fire and Security and Electronics for an aggregate cost of $44 million in
cash, net of $1 million of cash acquired. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tyco's
consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates.

During
2002, the Company purchased approximately 130 businesses for an aggregate cost of $3,751 million, consisting of $1,684 million in cash, net of $158 million of
cash acquired, and the issuance
of approximately 48 million common shares valued at $1,919 million, plus the fair value of stock options and pre-existing put option rights assumed of $148 million
($103 million of the put option rights have been paid in cash). The 2002 acquisitions include, among others, SBC/Smith Alarm Systems, Century Tube Corporation, Sensormatic Electronic
Corporation ("Sensormatic"), Transpower Technologies, DSC Group ("DSC"), Water & Power Technology, LINQ Industrial Fabrics, Inc., Paragon Trade Brands, Inc. ("Paragon"),
Communications Instruments, Inc., Clean Air Systems and the purchase of the remaining minority public interest of TyCom Ltd. ("TyCom"). In addition, Tyco issued approximately
18 million common shares valued at $820 million in connection with its amalgamation with TyCom (see TyCom Ltd. discussion below). The fair value of debt of acquired companies
aggregated $799 million. These acquisitions were funded utilizing net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been
included in Tyco's consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates.

Acquisition Liabilities

The Company paid $54 million, $172 million and $475 million in cash to fund acquisition liabilities related to acquisitions during 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

At
September 30, 2004, there were no acquisition liabilities related to 2004 or 2003 acquisitions reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During
2002, the Company recorded $195 million of acquisition liabilities related to plans to integrate businesses acquired during 2002. During 2003, the Company
finalized the integration plans that the Company began to assess and formulate at the date of the 2002 acquisitions, such as Paragon


and
Eberle Controls GmbH, and as a result recorded additional acquisition liabilities of $26 million and a corresponding increase to goodwill and deferred tax assets. These additions primarily
reflect the additional distributor and supplier cancellation fees. Through September 30, 2004, a total of $155 million has been expended related to these plans. Through
September 30, 2004, the Company also completed certain actions under these acquisition plans at costs that were less than originally estimated and as a result reduced its acquisition
liabilities by $38 million. Goodwill and related deferred tax assets were reduced by an equivalent amount.

The
termination of employees and consolidation of facilities related to the 2002 acquisitions are essentially complete, except that cash payments will continue related primarily to
certain long-term non-cancellable lease obligations and long-term severance arrangements.

During
2001, the Company recorded $1,021 million of acquisition liabilities related to plans to integrate businesses acquired during 2001. During 2002, the Company
finalized the integration plans that it began to assess and formulate at the date of the 2001 acquisitions, and as a result, recorded additional acquisition liabilities of $340 million. Through
September 30, 2004, a total of $957 million had been expended related to these plans. Through September 30, 2004, the Company completed certain actions under these acquisition
plans at costs that were less than originally estimated and as a result reduced 2001 acquisition liabilities by $300 million. Goodwill and related deferred tax assets in the aggregate
were reduced by an equivalent amount. Through September 30, 2004, the Company reclassified $29 million of fair value adjustments related to the write-down of assets to other
balance sheet accounts.

Actions
under the 2001 acquisition plans are essentially complete; however, cash payments will continue related primarily to certain long-term non-cancellable lease obligations and
long-term severence arrangements.

At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, acquisition liabilities were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions):



Accrued and other current liabilities

$


$


Other liabilities



$

Holdback/Earn-out Liabilities

The Company paid cash of approximately $53 million, $100 million and $150 million relating to holdback and earn-out liabilities
related to certain prior period acquisitions during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company also issued 44,139 common shares valued at $2 million relating to earn-out
liabilities during 2002. The value of these earn-out common shares is based upon the fair value of the stock at the time of issuance. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the
purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance
sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions that would require Tyco to make additional "earn-out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to
its acquisition by Tyco. These earn-out payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth and are generally treated as additional purchase
price.

At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, holdback/earn-out liabilities were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions):

ADT Dealer Program

During the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Tyco paid $254 million, $597 million and $1,138 million of cash,
respectively, to acquire 0.3 million, 0.6 million and 1.4 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.

TyCom Ltd.

On December 18, 2001, the Company completed its amalgamation with TyCom and each of the approximately 56 million TyCom common shares not owned by
Tyco were converted into the right to
receive 0.3133 of a Tyco common share. Upon completion of the amalgamation, TyCom became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco, and each outstanding option to purchase TyCom common shares became
exercisable for Tyco common shares, with the number of Tyco shares equal to the number of TyCom common shares issuable upon exercise immediately prior to the consummation multiplied by the exchange
ratio of 0.3133. The per share exercise price for the Tyco common shares issuable upon the exercise of TyCom options equals the exercise price per TyCom common share, at the price for which such
options were exercisable prior to the amalgamation, divided by the exchange ratio. In addition, each outstanding TyCom restricted share was converted into a restricted Tyco common share based on the
exchange ratio. The options and restricted shares are subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the amalgamation.

6.    Write-Off of Purchased In-Process Research and Development

During 2002, in connection with Tyco's acquisition of Sensormatic and DSC Group, the Company wrote-off the fair value of purchased
in-process research and development ("IPR&D") of various projects for the development of new products and technologies in the amount of $18 million. Management determined the value
of the IPR&D using, among other factors, appraisals.


7.    Other Expense, Net

During 2004, net other expense of $286 million consisted primarily of a $284 million loss related to the repurchase of a portion of its outstanding
convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases.

During
2003, net other expense of $223 million consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million. See Note 15 for details regarding debt
repurchases. Additionally, net other expense included an $87 million loss relating to the write-down of various investments when it became evident that the declines in the fair
value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications industry.

During
2002, net other expense of $217 million consisted primarily of a $271 million loss on various investments, mainly related to its investments in FLAG Telecom
Holdings Ltd. ("FLAG") when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of FLAG and other investments were other than
temporary. This loss was partially offset by a gain of $30 million related to the retirement of debt and a net gain on divestiture of $24 million (see Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).

8.    Income Taxes

The reconciliation between U.S. federal income taxes at the statutory rate and the Company's provision for income taxes on continuing operations for the years

for non-U.S. income taxes. The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2004 and 2003 includes $523 million and $57 million, respectively, for federal income taxes and
$40 million and $(98) million, respectively, for state income taxes. Income tax (benefit) provision relating to discontinued operations was ($9) million, $7 million and
$323 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Non-U.S. income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes was $3,329 million, $2,827 million and
$(665) million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

The
presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in prior years has been reclassified for comparability purposes to reflect the results of a detailed analysis of deferred tax
assets and liabilities completed during 2004. This reclassification included recording an additional deferred tax asset and a related full valuation allowance of $1,026 million as of
September 30, 2003.

At
September 30, 2004, the Company had $3,644 million of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Of these, $2,555 million
have no expiration, and the remaining $1,089 million will expire in future years through 2013. In the U.S., there were approximately $3,608 million of federal and $3,459 million
of state net operating loss carryforwards at September 30, 2004, which will expire in future years through 2024.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,992 million and $1,879 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relates principally to the
uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future
taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be
realized. At September 30, 2004, approximately $424 million of the valuation allowance will ultimately reduce goodwill if the net operating losses are utilized.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain proposed tax
deficiencies. Amounts


related
to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the
complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has
reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate
assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax
benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the
liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one
year.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially
permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by
such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences
related to investments in subsidiaries.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. It is not
expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to $500 million of permanently reinvested foreign
earnings in 2005 or 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. The Company is currently reviewing whether to take advantage of this new provision of the AJCA.

9.    Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change—Variable Interest Entities

During 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46, which requires identification of the Company's participation in VIE's, which are entities with a level of invested equity
that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. For
entities identified as VIE's, FIN 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to VIE's, if any, bears a majority of the risk to its expected losses,
or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns.

The
Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the
Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those
entities, but the Company does not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN 46.


The
Company has three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Company's segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and
for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46 and, accordingly, restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN 46 for
off-balance sheet accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and, consequently, recorded a $75 million after-tax loss ($115 million
pretax) cumulative effect adjustment. In addition, total debt increased by $498 million at the time of consolidation, July 1, 2003.

In
2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity
method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which the Company owns a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN 46. Accordingly, these ventures were
consolidated onto the Company's balance sheet effective July 1, 2003. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at
September 30, 2003 were $112 million and $96 million, respectively.

Subsequently,
these four joint ventures were deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 with the adoption of FIN 46R. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included
in the Company's balance sheet at September 30, 2003 were $96 million and $69 million, respectively.

10.    Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The computation of diluted earnings per common share in 2004 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of options to purchase approximately
67 million shares because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Additionally, diluted earnings per common share excludes approximately 5 million and 4 million shares related to the
Company's zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 and 2021, respectively, because the conversion conditions have not been met.

The
computation of diluted earnings per common share in 2003 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of options to purchase approximately 110 million shares because the
effect would be anti-dilutive. Diluted earnings per common share for 2003 excludes approximately 38 million and 4 million shares related to the Company's zero coupon convertible
debentures due 2020 and 2021, respectively, because conversion conditions have not been met. Diluted earnings per common share for 2003 also excludes approximately 94 million shares and
49 million shares related to the Company's convertible senior debentures due 2018 and 2023, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.


The
computation of diluted loss per common share in 2002 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of options to purchase approximately 10 million shares and the potential
exchange of convertible debt due 2010 for approximately 3 million shares, because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Diluted loss per common share for 2002 also excludes
approximately 48 million and approximately 25 million shares related to the Company's zero-coupon convertible debentures due 2020 and 2021, respectively, because conversion
conditions have not been met.

11.    Sale of Accounts Receivable

Tyco has several programs under which it may sell participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and
security interests in those receivables. As collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sells new receivables. The Company retains the risk of credit loss on the
receivables and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve has been retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to repay short-term and
long-term borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and are reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale proceeds are less
than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that
approximates the cost that would be incurred if commercial paper were issued backed by these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is accounted for as a loss on the sale of
receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such discount aggregated $18 million, $29 million, and
$17 million, or 3.1%, 3.5%, and 2.7% of the weighted-average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company retains collection and administrative
responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which
$812 million relates to three of its corporate accounts receivable programs. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the availability under corporate programs was $625 million and
$1,025 million, respectively. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the amounts utilized under these programs was zero and $803 million, respectively. The remaining reduction related to
certain of the Company's international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short-term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The aggregate amount
outstanding under these arrangements was $99 million and $202 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

12.    Investments

At September 30, 2004 and 2003, Tyco had available-for-sale equity investments with a fair market value of $104 million and
$23 million and a cost basis of $104 million and $26 million, respectively. These investments are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets within the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2004, there were unrealized losses of $2 million and unrealized gains of $5 million associated with these investments. At
September 30, 2003, there were unrealized losses of $2 million and unrealized gains of $4 million associated with these investments. The unrealized gains and losses have been
included as a separate component of shareholders' equity. See Note 7 for discussion of realized losses on equity investments.

At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, Tyco had held-to-maturity investments with a fair value of $19 million and $22 million, respectively. These
investments are included in other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

At
September 30, 2004 and 2003, Tyco had restricted investments of $7 million and $470 million, respectively. The majority of these restricted investments are used
to fund certain pension plans.

The
net decrease in goodwill includes $480 million associated with acquisitions completed prior to 2003, primarily related to fair value adjustments as well as
the finalization of deferred taxes related to previously recorded acquisition liabilities.

(2)

During
2004, the Company undertook a comprehensive project to review its 2003 deferred income tax accounts. While the results of this project were not material to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has reclassified certain prior year balances to enhance comparability.

(3)

The
net decrease in goodwill includes $233 million primarily due to the finalization of deferred taxes related to previously completed acquisitions.

2004 Activity

During 2004, the Company divested twenty-one and liquidated four non-core businesses (See Note 4). Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," it was determined that the recorded book value of these businesses would not be fully recovered. During 2004, the Company recorded goodwill
impairments of $60 million of which $48 million related to divested businesses and $12 million related to businesses classified as held for sale, respectively.

2003 Activity

During 2003, the Company changed its internal reporting structure such that the operations of Tyco's plastics and adhesives businesses (previously reported within
Healthcare and Specialty Products) now comprise the Plastics and Adhesives reportable segment. As a result, the goodwill within Healthcare and Specialty Products was reassigned based on the relative
fair value of the new reporting unit. No impairments resulted from this reevaluation.

In
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company further reorganized its reporting structure (see Note 23). As part of that reorganization, the Company finalized a plan in
September 2003 to sell the TGN, the major operating asset of the Tyco Submarine Telecommunications business. The results of the TGN business held for sale were previously included in
Electronics, but are now presented within Corporate and Other. The Company plans to exit the TGN business held for sale because it has


decided
not to invest further in this industry. The reorganization resulted in a change in the composition of its reporting units. As a result, goodwill was reassigned to the new reporting units using
a relative fair value allocation approach, resulting in the recognition of impairment charges of $278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group.
This charge was based on a valuation performed by management with the assistance of a third party consultant using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of each
of the reporting units. After the impairment, there is no goodwill remaining at the Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group reporting units.

2002 Activity

Under the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company's transitional benchmark analysis concluded that there was no goodwill impairment at
October 1, 2001. However, during the quarter ended March 31, 2002, Electronics recorded a charge of $2,218 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets of
the TGN, as a result of the fiber optic capacity available in the market significantly exceeding overall market demand, thereby creating sharply declining prices and reduced cash flows. For additional
information on the TGN impairment charge, see Note 3. As such, an updated goodwill valuation was completed as of March 31, 2002 for Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. The valuation was
completed using an income approach based upon the present value of future cash flows of the reporting unit as of March 31, 2002. However, this first step analysis resulted in no impairment of
the Submarine Telecommunications reporting unit's goodwill at that date.

During
the quarter ended June 30, 2002, additional circumstances developed that indicated a potential impairment of the value of goodwill with respect to the Company's reporting
units. Tyco experienced
disruptions to its business surrounding the termination of its previously announced break-up plan, the resignation of its chief executive officer, further downgrades in its credit ratings
and an additional decline in its market capitalization. Updated valuations were completed for all reporting units as of June 30, 2002 using an income approach based on the present value of
future cash flows of each reporting unit. An additional discount factor was then applied to reflect a decrease in reporting unit valuations for recent disruptions at the Company's corporate offices
and negative publicity about Tyco, as evidenced by the decline in the Company's total market capitalization. This resulted in goodwill impairment of $845 million, including $608 million
relating to Tyco Submarine Telecommunications and $237 million relating to Tyco Infrastructure Services, a reporting unit within Engineered Products and Services.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2002, step two analyses, as prescribed by SFAS No. 142, were completed for the Tyco Submarine Telecommunications and Tyco
Infrastructure Services reporting units. This resulted in an incremental goodwill impairment on continuing operations of $162 million ($80 million relating Tyco Submarine
Telecommunications and $82 million relating to Tyco Infrastructure Services).

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2002, circumstances associated with the restructuring charges related to the Submarine Telecommunications reporting unit indicated potential
further impairment of the value of goodwill of this reporting unit. An updated valuation using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows was completed as of
September 30, 2002. The valuation resulted in an additional goodwill impairment on continuing operations of $337 million.


Following
the impairments recorded during 2002 totaling $1,344 million, there is no goodwill remaining at the Tyco Submarine Telecommunications and Tyco Infrastructure Services reporting units.

During
2002, the Company curtailed, and in certain markets terminated, the ADT dealer program. Due to a decrease in projected purchases of customer contracts through the ADT dealer
program, an updated valuation using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows as of September 30, 2002 was performed for the Security Services reporting unit. The
valuation results indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the book value of the reporting unit, resulting in no impairment of the Security Services reporting unit's goodwill at
that date.

See
Note 4, "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations," for information regarding the impairment of goodwill relating to Tyco Capital.

Intangible
assets, net were $5,335 million and $5,779 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization amounted to
$3,066 million and $2,489 million at September 30, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The following table sets forth the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the Company's intangible assets at September 30, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions):

Intangible
assets not subject to amortization are excluded from the calculation of the weighted average

amortization period.

During 2004, the Company reassessed the useful lives of certain intangible assets. This reassessment resulted in an immaterial charge to
amortization expense due to shortening the amortization periods for certain patents and reclassifying certain tradenames to indefinite-lived intangible assets. The intangible asset classifications
have been conformed to the current period presentation.

As
of September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $672 million and $678 million of intangible assets not subject to amortization, respectively. These assets as of
September 30, 2004 primarily relate to tradenames of $389 million in Healthcare, intellectual property (primarily trademarks) of $261 million in Fire and Security as well as
Engineered Products and Services, and $22 million of other intangible assets. The intangible assets not subject to amortization as of September 30, 2003 primarily relate to tradenames of
$389 million in Healthcare, intellectual property (primarily trademarks) of $261 million in Fire and Security as well as Engineered Products and Services, and $28 million of other
intangibles.

Intangible
asset amortization expense for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $698 million, $724 million and $619 million, respectively. The
estimated aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets currently owned by the Company is expected to be approximately $650 million for 2005, $600 million for 2006,
$500 million for 2007, $450 million for 2008, and $450 million for 2009.

See
Note 3 for information regarding the impairment of intangible assets.


14.    Related Party Transactions

The Company has amounts due related to loans and advances issued to employees in prior years under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, relocation programs
and other advances made to executives. Loans were provided to employees under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, which is now discontinued except for outstanding loans, for the payment of taxes
upon the vesting of shares granted under our Restricted Share Ownership Plans. The loans are not collateralized and bear interest, payable annually, at a rate based on the six-month LIBOR,
calculated annually
as the average of the 12 rates in effect on the first day of the month. Loans are generally repayable in ten years, except that earlier payments are required under certain circumstances, such as when
an employee is terminated. In addition, the Company issued mortgages to certain employees under employee relocation programs. These mortgages are generally payable in 15 years and are
collateralized by the underlying property. During 2004 and 2003, the maximum amount outstanding under these programs was $78 million and $82 million, respectively. Loans receivable under
these programs, as well as other unsecured advances outstanding, were $70 and $79 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The total outstanding loans receivable includes
loans to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Company's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (until June 2002). The amount outstanding under these loans, plus accrued interest, was
$49 million and $48 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and the rate of interest charged on such loans was 1.25%. Interest income on the remaining interest
bearing loans totaled $1 million, $1 million, and $6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Certain of the above loans totaling $21 million and $24 million at
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are non-interest bearing. The total non-interest bearing loans include loans to Mark A. Belnick, the Company's former
Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Counsel. The amount outstanding at both September 30, 2004 and 2003 was $15 million.

During
2004, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Brunswick Corporation and VF Corporation. Sandra S. Wijnberg, a Director, is an executive officer of Marsh & McClennan
Companies, Inc. George W. Buckley, a Director, is an executive officer of Brunswick Corporation. Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive officer of VF Corporation. Purchases from
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. during 2004 were approximately $22 million. Purchases from other companies noted above during 2004 aggregated less than 1 percent of
consolidated net revenue.

During
2003, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Brunswick Corporation, VF Corporation, Verizon Communications, Inc., Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and MicroWarehouse, Inc.
Sandra S. Wijnberg, a Director, is an executive officer of Marsh & McClennan Companies, Inc. George W. Buckley, a Director, is an executive officer of Brunswick
Corporation. Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive officer of VF Corporation. Bruce S. Gordon, a Director, was an officer of Verizon Communications, Inc.
Brendan R. O'Neill and Jerome B. York, both Directors, were executive officers of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and MicroWarehouse, Inc., respectively, at the time of these
commercial transactions. Purchases from Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Imperial Chemical Industries PLC during 2003 were approximately $18 million and $16 million,
respectively. Purchases from other companies noted above during 2003 aggregated less than $15 million.

In
2001, Tyco authorized compensation arrangements to L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, the Company's Chief Financial Officer until August 2002. In connection
with such arrangements, Tyco purchased executive split dollar life insurance policies for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz and entered


into
a shared ownership agreement with each of them whereby the Company agreed to pay premiums for these insurance policies for an 11-year period beginning in 2001. In 2001, amended
policies were executed providing for additional Company-paid premiums. The Company is a co-beneficiary of the policies, less amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and
Swartz. Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz are the beneficiaries of the cash surrender values of the policies plus the amount of any unpaid premiums. The Company's obligations under these
arrangements were entered into in recognition of services rendered by these officers and were not contingent upon continuing employment. In 2001, the Company deposited $31 million into a
consolidated rabbi trust to fund premiums on the policies. The Consolidated Financial Statements include charges of $27 million related to the initial awards for Mr. Kozlowski and
$14 million for Mr. Swartz in 2001 and charges of $5 million for Mr. Kozlowski and $2 million for Mr. Swartz in 2002 under the policy, as amended. The
Consolidated Financial Statements include charges of $6 million for Mr. Kozlowski in both 2004 and 2003. In the event the investment options within the policies do not earn specified
interest amounts, Tyco has guaranteed a supplemental premium payment amount to ensure a 10% annual return on the cash surrender value, and any unpaid premiums. This liability is accreted by a charge
to earnings throughout the period of the arrangements to make the specified supplemental premium payments, if any. In conjunction with Mr. Swartz's termination of employment, a lump sum payment
of $25 million, which represented the present value of the annual premium amounts at his termination date for the remainder of the contractual period, was made to Mr. Swartz and in
return Mr. Swartz waived Tyco's obligation to continue making premium payments. The Company has accrued $58 million and $53 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in connection with these arrangements, of which $24 million is held in the rabbi trust as of September 30, 2004. Tyco's ability to
withdraw monies from the rabbi trust for purposes other than premium payments requires Mr. Kozlowski's approval. Tyco discontinued making premium payments for Mr. Kozlowski's insurance
policy as of October 1, 2002. The Company filed affirmative actions against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz, seeking disgorgement of all benefits under these executive life insurance
policies. Pending resolution of such action against Mr. Kozlowski, premium obligations since October 2002 have been drawn down from the cash surrender value of such policy to avoid
termination of such policy's death benefit.

During
2002, Mark H. Swartz, the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, had outstanding loans from Tyco. The rate of interest charged on such loans was 2.11%. The maximum
amount outstanding under these loans during 2002 was $25 million, plus accrued interest, and such loans were repaid in full prior to September 30, 2002.

Richard J.
Meelia, the President of Tyco Healthcare, had an outstanding loan under the Key Employee Loan Program. The rate of interest charged on such loan was 2.23% and 2.06% for
2003 and 2002, respectively. The maximum amount outstanding under this loan during 2003 and 2002 was significantly less than $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and such loan was
repaid in full prior to September 30, 2003.

During
2002, Robert P. Mead, the former President of Tyco Engineered Products and Services, had an outstanding loan under the Key Employee Loan Program. The rate of interest
charged on such loan was 2.03%. The maximum amount outstanding under this loan during 2002 was approximately $1 million, and such loan was repaid in full prior to September 30, 2002.

During
2002, Jerry R. Boggess, the former President of Tyco Fire and Security, had an outstanding loan under the Key Employee Loan Program. The rate of interest charged on such
loan was 2.03%.


The
maximum amount outstanding under this loan during 2002 was less than $1 million, and such loan was repaid in full prior to September 30, 2002.

During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors and new senior management adopted a policy under which no new loans are allowed to be granted to any officers of the Company and
existing loans are not allowed to be extended or modified.

Certain
former Tyco directors and executive officers owned TyCom Ltd. shares or options, which were converted to Tyco shares and Tyco options upon the amalgamation of a subsidiary
of Tyco with TyCom Ltd. on December 18, 2001 at the exchange ratio applicable to all holders of TyCom Ltd. shares and options.

Stephen
W. Foss was a Director of Tyco until March 6, 2003. Mr. Foss is the owner of a corporate aircraft which the Company leased from him starting in May 2001
after seeking competitive bids of which Mr. Foss's bid was considered the most competitive given anticipated usage. Tyco paid Mr. Foss, and a company of which he is president, an
aggregate of $587,000 in lease payments for the Company's use of the aircraft and its pilots during 2002. These leasing arrangements were terminated as of September 30, 2002.

Joshua
M. Berman was a Director of Tyco until December 5, 2002. From March 1, 2000 through July 31, 2002, the Company engaged Mr. Berman to render legal and
other services. During this period, the Company compensated Mr. Berman an annual rate of $360,000 and provided Mr. Berman with health benefits, secretarial assistance, a cell phone and
electronic security services for his homes. The Company also reimbursed Mr. Berman for legal fees and expenses incurred by him in connection with matters relating to Tyco pursuant to
indemnification provisions applicable to all directors of Tyco. Mr. Berman is a retired counsel to the law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, which provided legal services to the
Company during 2002.

The
Company filed civil complaints against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to alleged abuses of our Key Employee Loan
Program and
relocation program, unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self-dealing transactions and other improper conduct.

In
June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related
wrongful conduct involving a $20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The
payment was purportedly made for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging our acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh pleaded guilty to a felony
violation of New York law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York County) and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the SEC in United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Both the felony charge and the civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such payment. The felony charge accused
Mr. Walsh of intentionally concealing information concerning the payment from Tyco's directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities in the State of New York. The SEC
action alleged that Mr. Walsh knew that the registration statement covering the sale of Tyco securities as part of the CIT acquisition contained a material misrepresentation concerning fees
payable in connection with the acquisition. Pursuant to the plea and settlement, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on December 17, 2002. Our claims against
Mr. Walsh are still pending.

These

In November 2003, Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA") issued $1.0 billion 6.0% notes due 2013 in a private placement offering.
The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco. The net proceeds of approximately $988 million were used to repay a portion of the $2.0 billion outstanding under the
5-year revolving credit facility due 2006. These notes were subsequently exchanged for registered notes with substantially identical terms in an exchange offer that expired on
May 3, 2004.

In
November 2003, holders of principal amount at maturity of $3,197 million of zero coupon convertible senior debentures due 2020 notified Tyco that they had exercised
their option to require Tyco to repurchase their debentures at a price of $775.66 per $1,000 principal at maturity, representing


the
accreted value of the debentures on that date. On November 18, 2003, Tyco repurchased these debentures for cash of $2,480 million.

In
December 2003, TIGSA entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility, which includes a one year term-out option, and a
$1.5 billion 3-year revolving bank credit facility. These facilities have variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIGSA can vary based on changes in
its credit rating. These new facilities replaced the $1.5 billion undrawn 364-day revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in January 2004, and the
$2.0 billion drawn 5-year revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in February 2006. As of September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings
under either facility. The $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility expires on December 20, 2004, and the Company expects that the facility will be replaced by a
$1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility prior to its expiration. The $1.5 billion 3-year revolving credit facility expires on December 22, 2006.

In
June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3-year unsecured letter of credit facility. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit,
supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this
facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSA's bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSA's 6.0% notes due
2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the bank's base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the
occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the release of
approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2004 there are no outstanding borrowings under this facility.

In
June 2004, the Company purchased $303 million of its 8.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including unamortized
debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt.

In
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid
was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

The
Company's bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and other covenants that limit the Company's ability to pledge assets and to make substantial payments in connection with its capital shares. At
September 30, 2004, the Company had three synthetic lease facilities, of which one has since expired on December 10, 2004, with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage
ratios. The Company's outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are presently
considered restrictive to the Company's operations. The Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The
fair value of debt was approximately $19,392 million (book value of $16,733 million) and $21,652 million (book value of $20,965 million) at September 30,
2004 and 2003, respectively, based on discounted cash flow analyses using current market interest rates.


The
aggregate amounts of total debt maturing during the next five years are as follows (in millions): $2,116 in 2005, $2,026 in 2006, $764 in 2007, $2,608 in 2008, $1,648 in 2009 and
$7,571 thereafter.

The
weighted-average rate of interest on total debt was 5.4% and 4.9% at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The weighted-average rate of interest on all variable debt was
6.2% and 5.9% at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The impact of the Company's interest rate swap agreements on reported interest expense was a reduction of $66 million, zero
and $116 million and for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

16.    Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2005 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, annual results of operations or
cash flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 18 for a discussion of these liabilities.

The
Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2004 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which
is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on its estimate of the fair value of the vessels (see Note 18).

As
a result of exiting certain facilities as part of restructuring and acquisition plans, or otherwise, the Company continues to lease certain properties which it has vacated but has
sub-let to third parties. In the event the third parties vacate the premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the
financial risk of default by
sub-lessors is not material, individually and in the aggregate, to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Note 1.

Settlements
made include spending of $78 million by Engineered Products and Services in connection with a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of
Central Sprinkler. The VRP was initiated in 2001 and relates to the recall of certain Model GB fire sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler. Identification and
investigation of problems with the sprinkler heads commenced prior to Tyco's acquisition. All affected sprinkler heads are replaced over a 5-7 year period free of charge to property
owners.

17.    Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, long-term investments, accounts payable, debt
and derivative financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, long-term investments, accounts payable and derivative financial instruments
approximated book value at September 30, 2004 and 2003. See Note 15 for the fair value estimates of debt.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and changes in a derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge criteria are met.

Interest Rate Exposures

The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Under these agreements, the Company receives fixed rates of
interest ranging from 6% to 6.75% and pays floating rates of interest based on six month LIBOR. At September 30, 2004, the Company had interest rate swaps in a net gain position of
$53 million designated as fair value hedges with expiration dates in 2011 and 2013. The mark-to-market effects of both the interest rate swap agreements and the
underlying debt obligations were recorded in interest expense and are directly offsetting to the extent the hedges are effective. As a result, the impact on income due to ineffectiveness was not
significant.

Foreign Currency Exposures

The Company hedges its net investment in certain foreign operations. Included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income was
a net loss of $194 ($142 after tax) at September 30, 2004.


The
Company uses forward agreements to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on raw material purchases. These forward agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains
and losses resulting from these hedges, the amounts of which are not material in any period presented, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive
income to earnings and recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales when the underlying transaction impacts earnings.

Tyco
uses various options, swaps, cross-currency swaps and forwards not designated as hedging instruments, to manage foreign currency exposures on accounts and notes receivable, accounts
payable, intercompany loan balances and forecast transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. At September 30, 2004, the Company had recorded net assets of $78 million related
to these transactions.

18.    Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has facility, vehicle and equipment leases that expire at various dates through the year 2050. Rental expense under these leases and leases for
equipment was $790 million, $848 million and $837 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At September 30, 2004, the minimum lease payment obligations under
non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: $658 million in 2005, $529 million in 2006, $377 million in 2007, $273 million in 2008, $212 million in
2009 and an aggregate of $862 million in years 2010 through 2050. These payments include obligations under an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea
vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in October 2006, a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy these vessels for approximately $280 million, or return the vessels to the lessor and,
under a residual guarantee, pay any shortfall in sales proceeds to the lessor from a third party in an amount not to exceed $235 million. As of September 30, 2004, the Company expects
this obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on an estimate of the fair value of the vessels performed by management with the
assistance of a third-party valuation. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company incurred expenses of $14 million, $11 million and $2 million, respectively, related to this expected
obligation.

At
September 30, 2004, the Company had a contingent liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by Electronics. This represents the
maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has
approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. No provision has been made in Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably
determined.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Class Actions

As a result of actions taken by the Company's former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of the Company's former senior corporate management, former
members of our Board of Directors and the Company's current Chief Executive Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the
federal securities laws. Tyco, certain of the Company's current and former employees, some members of the Company's former


senior
corporate management and some former members of the Company's Board of Directors also are named as defendants in several Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") class actions. In
addition, Tyco and some members of the Company's former senior corporate management are subject to a SEC inquiry, and some members of the Company's former senior corporate management are named as
defendants in criminal cases being prosecuted by the District Attorney of New York County. The findings and outcomes of the prosecutions and the SEC civil action may affect the course of the purported
securities class actions and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco. The Company is generally obligated to indemnify its directors and officers and its former directors and officers who are named as
defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, the Company's insurance carriers may decline coverage, or the Company's coverage may be insufficient to
cover its expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. The Company is unable at this time to estimate what its ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that the
Company will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these
matters.

Investigation

The Company and others have received subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the District Attorney of New York County, the Department of
Labor and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into the Company's governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls.
Certain current and former employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices for the ADT dealer connect
fees. As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of the Company's
benefit plans. The Company cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can the Company predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that the Company will
be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact the Company's
business with non-governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. It is not possible to estimate the amount
of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Intellectual Property Litigation

Mallinckrodt, Inc. ("Mallinckrodt") and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc. ("Nellcor"), plaintiffs/counter-defendants v. Masimo
Corporation ("Masimo") et al., defendants/counter-claimants,

is a consolidated patent infringement action in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. Nellcor alleges that Masimo infringed one Nellcor patent related to pulse oximeters, which are medical devices used to measure blood oxygen levels in patients, and Masimo alleges that
Nellcor infringed four Masimo patents related to pulse oximeters. Trial in the action commenced on February 18, 2004. On March 16, 2004, the jury returned a liability finding that
Nellcor willfully infringed the four Masimo patents and that Masimo did not infringe the one Nellcor patent. On March 26, 2004, the jury awarded Masimo $134.5 million in damages for
Nellcor's alleged infringement through December 31, 2003.


After
hearing post-trial motions, the district court issued an order on July 14, 2004 which (i) denied Masimo's request to impose an injunction on the sale of pulse
oximeters; (ii) reversed the jury finding of patent infringement for one of the four patents at issue; (iii) ruled that a second patent was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable
conduct in seeking the patent; and (iv) overturned the jury finding that the infringement was "willful." On August 6, 2004, the district court entered final judgment that included
additional damages of $29.5 million for Nellcor's alleged infringement from January 1, 2004 through May 31, 2004. Nellcor is appealing the jury's infringement finding on the
remaining two Masimo patents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The briefing for the appeal is scheduled to be completed by February 28, 2005. The Court of Appeals
has not yet scheduled oral argument for the appeal. Tyco has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the jury's decision will be overturned and,
further, Tyco intends to vigorously pursue all available means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to this damage
award.

Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP ("Tyco Healthcare") and Mallinckrodt, Inc.

is a separate lawsuit also pending in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt are subsidiaries of Tyco. In this lawsuit, Masimo alleges violations of antitrust laws against
Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximeter products. Masimo alleges that Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt used their market position to prevent hospitals from purchasing
Masimo's pulse oximetry products. Masimo seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages. Trial is scheduled to begin on February 22, 2005. At this time, Tyco cannot
predict the outcome of the antitrust case and, therefore, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or the range of potential losses that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement in
this matter. It is possible that Tyco will be required to pay an award of damages in the antitrust lawsuit.

Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") v. United States Surgical ("U.S. Surgical")

is a patent infringement action in which
U.S. Surgical, a subsidiary of Tyco, is the defendant. In February 2002, the United States District Court for the Central District of California held that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL universal
seal system, contained in certain surgical trocar and access devices manufactured by U.S. Surgical, infringed certain of the plaintiff's patents. The district court entered a permanent injunction
against U.S. Surgical based upon infringement of one of the three patents involved in the suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's permanent
injunction ruling in September 2003 for the VERSASEAL product, which is no longer on the market. In October 2003, the district court ruled in U.S. Surgical's favor, holding that two
other patents involved in the case were invalid. A trial on damages for the earlier infringement ruling in the district court concluded on July 27, 2004. The jury awarded Applied Medical
$43.5 million in damages and returned a finding that the earlier infringement was willful, giving the district court discretion to enhance those damages to up to treble the damages awarded to
Applied Medical by the jury. On October 1, 2004, the district court issued post-trial rulings that (i) denied U.S. Surgical's motion to set aside the jury's finding on
willfulness; and (ii) granted Applied Medical's motion for enhanced damages, enhancing the jury's damages award by 25%, or $11 million. The district court will also consider during post
trial proceedings what pre-judgment interest, if any, should be awarded, and whether Applied Medical is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees. After the proceedings are completed at the
district court, U.S. Surgical will appeal the damages award and the willfulness finding


to
the court of appeals. Tyco has recorded a liability related to this matter, and does not expect to incur material losses beyond what has already been accrued.

On
July 31, 2003, Applied Medical filed another patent infringement suit against U.S. Surgical in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint alleges that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL Plus trocar product infringes Applied Medical's U.S. Patent No. 5,385,533. Applied Medical seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. Applied Medical filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the district court denied on December 23, 2003. Trial is
currently scheduled to commence in March 2005. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this patent infringement case and, therefore, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss
or range of potential losses that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement in this matter.

Environmental

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site
cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of
September 30, 2004, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $167 million to $443 million. As of September 30,
2004, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $265 million, of which $42 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and
$223 million is
included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $265 million, the Company believes that
any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos

Like
many other companies, Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Consistent
with the national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been
filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while
on a subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat-resistant industrial products
incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate
defendants.

Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these
claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial
court proceeding related to asbestos claims.


TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

When
appropriate, the Company settles claims. However, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 30, 2004, there
were approximately 14,500 asbestos liability cases pending against us and our subsidiaries.

The
Company believes that it and its subsidiaries have substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles, with respect to asbestos claims.
These indemnitors and the relevant carriers typically have been honoring their duty to defend and indemnify. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these claims and intends to continue to
defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on the Company's historical experience in asbestos litigation and an analysis of the Company's current cases, the Company believes that it has adequate
amounts recorded for potential settlements and adverse judgments in asbestos-related litigation. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these
asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance
coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Matters

The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company
does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
new internal controls and procedures are implemented, any reported allegations or violations of the Company's guide to ethical conduct are investigated and appropriate disciplinary
and remedial measures are taken. An allegation was brought to the Company's attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non-U.S.
subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, the Company conducted an internal investigation into these allegations and whether certain payments
were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. The Company has taken remedial steps and have reported the results of its investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC and
are cooperating with their inquiry. The Company does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

19.    Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined
benefit retirement plans covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit
cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the
expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits
under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. The following tables exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods
presented. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for all of its pension plans.


The
net periodic benefit cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows ($ in

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance
expectations as provided by its external advisors.

The
Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a superior return on assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40%
allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S. pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 57% to equity securities, 32% to
debt securities and 11% to other asset classes, including real estate and cash equivalents.


Pension
plans have the following weighted-average asset allocations at September 30, 2004 and 2003:

The
Company made significant voluntary contributions on September 30, 2004 that were held in cash and cash equivalents on that date, which increased the cash and
cash equivalent asset allocation percentage to 11% for the U.S. plans at September 30, 2004.

Although
the Company does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly
hold Tyco stock. The aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that at a minimum it will make the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in 2005 of $9 million for
the U.S. plans and $185 million for non-U.S. plans.

Benefit
payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows ($ in millions):

2010–2014



The
accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. plans as of September 30, 2004 and 2003 was $2,210 and $2,208, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for
all non-U.S. plans as of September 30, 2004 and 2003 was $2,361 and $2,046, respectively.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2,201 million and
$1,984 million, respectively, at September 30, 2004 and $2,201 million and $1,496 million, respectively, at September 30, 2003.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$2,214 million and $1,346 million, respectively, at September 30, 2004 and $1,936 million and $1,134 million, respectively, at September 30, 2003.


The
Company also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit plans on behalf of certain employees. Pension expense related to multi-employer plans was $13 million,
$14 million and $10 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Executive Retirement Arrangements

—Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz participated in individual Executive Retirement
Arrangements maintained by Tyco (the "ERA"). Under the ERA, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz would have fixed lifetime benefits commencing at their normal retirement age of 65. The Company's
accrued benefit obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 30, 2004 were $58 million and $30 million, respectively. The Company's accrued benefit
obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 30, 2003 were $54 million and $28 million, respectively. Retirement benefits are available at earlier ages and
alternative forms of benefits can be elected. Any such variations would be actuarially equivalent to the fixed lifetime benefit starting at age 65. Amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz
under the ERA are in dispute by the Company. For further information, see Note 14.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

—The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include
401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants'
compensation and was $152 million, $184 million and $180 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company also maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan ("SERP"). This plan is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to IRS limits on eligible compensation under the defined contribution plans. Expense related to
the SERP was $3 million, $4 million and $16 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer
a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts.
The measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation expense was
$15 million, $17 million and $16 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $158 million, $189 million and
$182 million at September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Rabbi Trust

—The Company has established a rabbi trust to fund deferred compensation and SERP liabilities that is currently
funded primarily through corporate-owned life insurance policies. The rabbi trust assets, which are consolidated, are available to pay plan benefits and are subject to the claims of the Company's
creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. The cash surrender value of these policies, net of outstanding loans, included in other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were
$210 million, $232 million and $316 million at September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At the September 30, 2004, the rabbi trust also held
$32 million of cash. The employees are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

—The Company generally does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions for its
employees. However, certain acquired operations provide these benefits to employees who were eligible at the date of acquisition, and a small number of U.S. and Canadian operations provide
on-going eligibility for such benefits. The following tables exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company uses a September 30
measurement date for all of its postretirement benefit plans.

2010–2014


For
measurement purposes, for the years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, a 12.71% and 11.55% composite annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
benefits was assumed, respectively. At September 30, 2003, the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by the year 2011 and remain at that level thereafter. At September 30,
2004, the composite annual rate of increase in health care benefit costs was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by the year 2013 and remain at
that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects ($ in millions):

20.    Shareholders' Equity

Preference Shares

—Tyco has authorized 125,000,000 preference shares, par value of $1 per share, at September 30, 2004
and 2003, of which none and one such share, respectively, was issued and outstanding. The one preference share was designated a special voting preference share in connection with the purchase of CIT
in June 2001. This preference share provided a mechanism by which the holders of outstanding exchangeable shares exercised their voting, dividend and liquidation rights, which were equivalent
to those of Tyco common shareholders, except that each exchangeable share was equivalent to 0.6907 of a Tyco common share. In connection with the IPO of CIT, the exchangeable shares were redeemed
effective July 5, 2002 through the issuance of 3,243,322 Tyco common shares. As a result, no one was entitled to exercise the rights attaching to the preference share.

Rights
as to dividends, return of capital, redemption, conversion, voting and otherwise with respect to the preference shares may be determined by Tyco's Board of Directors on or before
the time of issuance. In the event of the liquidation of the Company, the holders of any preference shares then outstanding would be entitled to payment to them of the amount for which the preference
shares were subscribed and any unpaid dividends prior to any payment to the common shareholders.

Dividends

—Tyco has paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0125 per common share since July 1997.


Shares Owned by Subsidiaries

—Shares owned by subsidiaries are treated as treasury shares and are recorded at cost.

21.    Share Plans

As of January 1, 2004, the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") became effective due to affirmative vote of a
majority of the common shares represented in person or by proxy at the 2004 Annual General Meeting. The 2004 Plan replaces the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended as of
May 12, 1999 (the "LTIP I Plan"), the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan"), as well as Tyco International Ltd. 1994
Restricted Stock Ownership Plan for Key Employees (the "1994 Plan") for all awards effective on and after March 25, 2004. The 2004 Plan provides for the award of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long term performance awards, restricted units, restricted stock, deferred stock units, promissory stock and other stock-based awards (collectively,
"Awards").

The
2004 Plan provides for a maximum of 160 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan. In addition, any
common shares that have been approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the 1994 Plan and the LTIP Plans but which have not been awarded thereunder as of January 1, 2004, reduced
by the number of common shares related to Awards made under the LTIP Plans between January 1, 2004 and the date the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, (or which have been awarded but will
not be issued, owing to expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004) and which are no longer available
for any reason (including the termination of the 1994 Plan or the LTIP Plans) will also be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. When common shares are issued pursuant to a grant of restricted
stock, restricted units, deferred stock units, promissory stock, performance units or as payment of an annual performance bonus or other stock-based award, the total number of common shares remaining
available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per common share issued. At September 30, 2004, there were approximately 185 million shares available for future grant
under the 2004 Plan (including shares available under both the LTIP I and LTIP II Plans which are now assumable under the 2004 Plan).

The
1994 Plan provided for the issuance of restricted stock grants to officers and non-officer employees. The number of shares available for issuance under the 1994 Plan was
reduced to 999,524 in October 2002, but was automatically increased by 10 million shares, or 0.5%
of the total common shares outstanding on October 1, 2003, in accordance with the terms of the plan. However, upon effectiveness of the 2004 Plan, the automatic increase in shares available for
issuance under the 1994 Plan did not occur on October 1, 2004 and will not occur in the future.

The
LTIP I Plan reserved common shares for issuance to Tyco's directors, executives and managers as share options. This plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, which consists exclusively of independent directors of the Company. Tyco has reserved 140 million common shares for issuance under the LTIP I Plan. At
September 30, 2004, there were approximately 28 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan but now available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

The
LTIP II Plan was a broad-based option plan for non-officer employees. Tyco has reserved 100 million common shares for issuance under the LTIP II Plan. The
terms and conditions of this plan


are
similar to the LTIP I Plan. At September 30, 2004, there were approximately 18 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan but now available for future
grant under the 2004 Plan.

Restricted Shares

—Common shares are awarded subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time
of grant. The 2004 Plan indicates that, unless otherwise stated, the stock will vest in equal annual installments over a period of four years. However, the majority of Tyco's restricted share grants
cliff vest after three years. All restrictions on the stock will lapse upon normal retirement, death or disability of the employee.

For
grants which vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market value of the shares at the date of vesting is expensed over the period of performance, once
achievement of criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the shares at the time of the grant is amortized (net of income tax benefit) to
expense over the period of vesting. Unamortized compensation expense is recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity. Recipients of all restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and
receive dividends. Income tax benefits resulting from the vesting of restricted shares, including a deduction for the excess, if any, of the fair market value of restricted shares at the time of
vesting over their fair market value at the time of the grants and from the payment of dividends on unvested shares, are credited to contributed surplus.

At
September 30, 2004, 19 million shares had been granted, of which 3 million were granted under the 2004 Plan and 16 million were granted under the 1994
Plan.

Share Options

—Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of
the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. The 2004 Plan indicates that, unless otherwise stated, the options will become
exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. However, the majority of Tyco's stock option grants vest in
equal annual installments over three years. Options assumed as part of business combination transactions are administered under Tyco's plan but do not reduce the available shares and retain all the
rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted.

At
September 30, 2004, approximately 372 million share options had been granted, of which 230 million, 124 million and 18 million were granted under
the LTIP I, LTIP II and 2004 Plans, respectively.

Deferred Stock Units

—Deferred Stock Units ("DSU's") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco common shares with
distribution deferred until termination of employment. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the fair
market value of the DSU's at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The unamortized portion of deferred compensation expense is recorded as a reduction of
shareholders' equity. Recipients of DSU's do not have the right to vote such shares and do not have the right to receive cash dividends. However, they have the right
to receive dividends in the form of additional DSU's. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. The 2004 Plan indicates that, unless otherwise stated, the DSU's will vest in equal
annual installments over four years. However, the majority of Tyco's DSU grants vest in equal annual installments over three years.

The
Company has granted 2 million DSU's, all of which were outstanding at September 30, 2004.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

—Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and
employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in an employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the
purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All shares purchased under the plan are purchased
on the open market by a designated broker.

The
Company also maintains two other employee stock purchase plans for the benefit of employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under one plan, eligible employees
are granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. As of September 30, 2004, there were approximately 3 million
options outstanding and 7 million shares available for future issuance under this plan. All shares purchased under the other plan are purchased on the open market.

The total compensation cost for all stock-based compensation awards was $42 million, $43 million and $90 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, contributed
surplus includes $115 and $46 million of unamortized compensation expense for 2004 and 2003, respectively.

23.    Consolidated Segment and Geographic Data

The Company's segments are strategic business units that operate in different industries and are managed separately. Certain corporate expenses were allocated to
each operating segment's operating income, based generally on net revenues.

The
Company operates in the following business segments:

•

Fire
and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems.

•

Electronics
designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components.

•

Healthcare
designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products.

•

Engineered
Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls as well as steel tubular
goods, and provides environmental and other industrial consulting services.

•

Plastics
and Adhesives designs, manufactures and distributes plastic products, adhesives and films.


During
2004, Tyco's Precision Interconnect business was transferred from Healthcare to Electronics. During 2003, the Company finalized its plan to sell the TGN and, as a result,
reorganized its reporting structure such that the results of the TGN business held for sale are presented within Corporate and Other. Also, during 2003, the Company changed its internal reporting
structure such that the operations of Tyco's plastics and adhesives businesses (previously reported within Healthcare and Specialty Products) now comprise the Plastics and Adhesives reportable
segment. The Company has conformed its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period information to reflect these changes. Additionally, the segment and geographic data
has been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations.

Selected
information by business segment is presented in the following tables for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions).

Changes in Estimates Recorded During the Quarter Ended March 31, 2003—

During
the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company intensified a process whereby internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews were conducted. As a result of this process, the Company
recorded $389 million of pretax charges relating to new information and changes in facts and circumstances occurring during the quarter. The process included assessing the continued
recoverability of assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and installed security systems and equity investments, and the estimated costs of settling legal, environmental and insurance
obligations. The assessments were based on an analysis of the impact of circumstances that occurred during the quarter and on our assessment of the recoverability of certain assets and costs to settle
certain liabilities. The assessments include changes in judgments relative to the adequacy of reserves and contingent liabilities. Concurrent with this review process and resulting assessments by
management during the quarter, the Company decided to discontinue existing product lines and terminate an information technology


systems
implementation project. As a result of these decisions, inventory and other asset balances were written down to their net realizable value.

The
impact of the net charges recorded in the second quarter of and included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2003 is as follows ($ in millions):

Selling, general and administrative expense

(10

)

Operating income

(304

)

Other expense, net

(85

)

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest

$

(389

)

The net charges include $140 million related to asset reserve valuations, $95 million of increased cost estimates for insurance
liabilities ($49 million for workers' compensation accruals and $46 million for product and general liability insurance liabilities), $84 million related to an other than
temporary decline in the value of investments, $62 million for other accounting estimate changes described below, environmental liabilities of $18 million, legal accruals of
$20 million, other various accruals of $15 million, $17 million for account write-offs included primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, where the
Company concluded that the recoverability of various asset balances had become doubtful, and a $10 million write-off of capitalized external costs for a European financial computer
system based on the Company's decision in the second quarter to discontinue the new system under development and continue to use the existing system. The above charges are partially offset by credits
of $72 million, of which $12 million is included in cost of sales, related to restructuring charge reversals (see Note 2) that arose during the second quarter of 2003.

The
adjustments for asset valuations include a $77 million write-down of inventories, $52 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and
$11 million write-off of subscriber systems. The inventory charge of $77 million was primarily due to the finalization of plans regarding the disposition of inventory in
connection with curtailed programs and product lines and the Company's decision during the second quarter to exit certain product lines in our fire and security business. The increases in the
allowance for doubtful accounts and the write-off of subscriber systems were primarily due to the further deterioration in accounts receivable aging and increased customer cancellations in
certain non-strategic European security businesses
during the second quarter. The inventory charge and subscriber systems write-offs are included in cost of sales and the allowance for doubtful accounts revision is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses.

The
workers' compensation and product and general liability changes in estimate are based on management estimates with the assistance of third-party actuarial valuations of insurance
liabilities. The charge is included in selling, general and administrative expenses ($65 million) and cost of product sales ($30 million). These adjustments related to changes in facts
and circumstances occurring during the quarter ended March 31, 2003 which necessitated a change in assumptions and estimates. In particular, the Company identified trend data which required the
Company to revise its assumptions as a result of an unanticipated increase in the number and changes in the nature of claims incurred and the rate of increase of medical costs, as well as the
emergence of previously unanticipated new claims. In addition, the Company experienced an increase in workers' compensation expense, particularly in California, as a result of adverse legal
developments toward employers.


The
investment write-down, included in other (expense) income, net, primarily consists of a $76 million loss on various equity investments. It became evident in the
quarter ended March 31, 2003 that the declines in the fair values of the investments were other than temporary, primarily due to depressed economic conditions. Factors that management
considered in making its assessment included investees' inability to raise funds during the quarter, bankruptcy, continued losses by the investees, lack of sufficient future expected cash flows, and
lower entity valuations based on recent private financing activity. During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company also recognized other expense of $8 million in connection with a
bank guarantee on behalf of an equity investee.

Other
accounting estimates includes a charge to selling, general and administrative expenses of $17 million resulting from the Company's revision in the second quarter of deferred
commissions related to long-term contracts, $12 million to write-down company-owned properties based on real estate assessments and purchase offers received in the
second quarter for assets held for sale, $12 million of additional severance related to terminated executives, and $21 million of other accounting estimate changes, none of which are
individually significant, that were included primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The
increased environmental reserves resulted from the finalization of the Company's plan to remediate one of its manufacturing sites in the second quarter, $20 million to
establish a reserve related to the estimated settlement amount for contractual disputes and other legal matters based on our determination that such amounts became both probable and estimable in the
second quarter, and $15 million of other miscellaneous increased accrual estimates that are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

28.   Subsequent Event

In November 2004, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN to one of India's telephone and internet service providers for $130 million. If the
sale is consummated, the Company would expect to record a gain. The sale is subject to governmental approval in the United States, India and other countries. The Company has presented the operations
of the TGN in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations have not been met at September 30, 2004. As the finalization of the proposed transaction progresses, the Company
will continue to assess the criteria for discontinued operations treatment.

On
December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the Company's common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per
share. The dividend is payable on February 1, 2005 to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2005.
