Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

History and Development

Tyco International Ltd.

Tyco International Ltd. is a Company organized under the laws of Switzerland. The Company was created as a result of the July
1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited, a public company organized under the laws of Bermuda, at which time ADT Limited changed its name to
Tyco International Ltd. Effective March 17, 2009, the Company became a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile").

Effective
June 29, 2007, the Company completed the spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity, formerly our Healthcare and Electronics businesses of Tyco, respectively,
into separate, publicly traded companies (the "2007 Separation") in the form of a tax-free distribution to Tyco shareholders.

Effective
September 28, 2012, the Company completed the spin-offs of The ADT Corporation ("ADT") and Pentair Ltd. (formerly known as Tyco Flow Control
International Ltd. ("Tyco Flow Control")), formerly our North American residential security and flow control businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the form of a
distribution to Tyco shareholders. Immediately following the spin-off, Pentair, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Tyco Flow Control in a tax-free, all-stock merger (the
"Merger"), with Pentair Ltd. ("Pentair") succeeding Pentair Inc. as an independent publicly traded company. The distributions, the Merger and related transactions are collectively referred to
herein as the "2012 Separation". As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tyco's former flow control and North American residential security businesses are now classified as
discontinued operations in all periods presented.

Tyco's
registered and principal office is located at Freier Platz 10, CH-8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Its management office in the United States is located at 9 Roszel
Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.

Segments

As a result of the 2012 Separation we now operate and report financial and operating information in three new segments: NA
Installation & Services, ROW Installation & Services and Global Products. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Each
of our segments serves a highly diverse customer base and none is dependent upon a single customer or group of customers. For fiscal year 2012, no customer accounted for more than
10% of our revenues, and approximately 50% of our revenues were derived from customers outside of North America.

Our
end-use customers, to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers, distributors, commercial builders or contractors, can generally be grouped in the following
categories:

•

Commercial customers, including residential and commercial property developers, financial institutions, food service
businesses and commercial enterprises;

•

Industrial customers, including companies in the oil and gas, power generation, mining, petrochemical and other
industries;

•

Retail customers, including international, regional and local consumer outlets;

•

Institutional customers, including a broad range of healthcare facilities, academic institutions, museums and foundations;



•

Governmental customers, including federal, state and local governments, defense installations, mass transportation
networks, public utilities and other government-affiliated entities and applications; and

•

Residential and small business customers outside of North America, including owners of single-family homes and local
providers of a wide range of goods and services.

As
discussed under "Competition" below, the markets in which we compete are generally highly fragmented. We therefore compete with many other businesses in markets throughout the world,
including other large global businesses, significant regional businesses and many smaller local businesses.

Installation & Services

NA Installation & Services and ROW Installation & Services (collectively, "Installation & Services") designs,
sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security and fire detection and suppression systems for retail, commercial, industrial, governmental and institutional customers around the world.
Additionally, ROW Installation & Services designs, sells, installs, services and monitors security systems for residential and small business customers under the ADT brand name outside of North
America.

Security Services

Our Installation & Services segments design, sell, install and service security systems to detect intrusion, control access and
react to movement, fire, smoke, flooding,
environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These electronic security systems include detection devices that are usually connected to a monitoring center that receives and
records alarm signals where security monitoring specialists verify alarm conditions and initiate a range of response scenarios. For most systems, control panels identify the nature of the alarm and
the areas where a sensor was triggered. Our other security solutions include access control systems for sensitive areas such as government facilities and banks; video surveillance systems designed to
deter theft and fraud and help protect employees and customers; and asset protection and security management systems designed to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary electronic
data. Our offerings also include anti-theft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry as well as store performance
solutions to enhance retailer performance. Many of the world's leading retailers use our

Sensormatic

anti-theft systems to help protect
against shoplifting and employee theft. Many of the products that we install for our Installation & Services security customers are designed and manufactured by our Global Products segment.
Additionally, our deep experience in designing, integrating, deploying and maintaining large-scale security systems—including, for example, centrally managed security systems that span
large commercial and institutional campuses—allows us to install and/or service products manufactured by third parties.

Purchasers
of our intrusion systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. These contracts are generally
for a term of one to three years. Systems installed at customers' premises may be owned by us or by our customers. Monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information
to local fire or police departments, notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action. In certain markets, we directly provide the alarm response services with highly trained and
professionally equipped employees. In some instances, alarm systems are connected directly to local fire or police departments.

In
addition, our ROW Installation & Services segment is a leading provider of monitored residential and small business security systems. In addition to traditional burglar alarm
and fire detection systems, installation and monitoring services, ROW Installation & Services provides patrol and response services in select geographies, including South Africa and Korea. Our
ROW



Installation &
Services segment continues to expand its offering of value-added residential services worldwide, such as an interactive services platform. The interactive services platform
allows for remote management of the home security system, as well as lifestyle applications, which currently include remote video, lighting control, and energy management.

Our
customers are often prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that
a system be installed as a condition of coverage.

Fire Protection Services

Our Installation & Services segments design, sell, install and service fire detection and fire suppression systems in both new
and existing facilities. Commercial construction as well as legislation mandating the installation and service of fire detection and suppression systems drives the demand for our products. Our
Installation & Services segments offer a wide range of fire detection and suppression systems, including those designed and manufactured by our Global Products segment and those designed by
third parties. These detection systems include fire alarm control panels, advanced fire alarm monitoring systems, smoke, flame detection systems, heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice
evacuation systems. Our Installation & Services segments also offer a wide range of standard water-based sprinkler and chemical suppression systems and custom designed special hazard
suppression systems, which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases in addition to spill control products designed to absorb, neutralize and solidify spills
of hazardous materials. These systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications, including oil and gas, power generation, mining, petrochemical,
manufacturing, transportation, data processing, telecommunications, commercial food preparation and marine applications. Our Installation & Services segments continue to focus on system
maintenance and inspection, which have become increasingly important parts of our business.

Customers

Our Installation & Services customers range from Fortune 500 companies with diverse worldwide operations who look to us to
provide integrated, global solutions for their fire and security needs, to single location commercial customers and individual homeowners. Our Installation & Services customer relationships
generally are in the market for new construction or retrofit projects, which represented 45% of Installation & Services fiscal 2012 net revenue, and the market for aftermarket products and services,
which accounted for the remaining 55% of Installation & Services fiscal 2012 net revenue. New construction projects are inherently long-lead in nature and we strive to become involved in
the planning process for these projects as early as possible. We believe that by actively participating in the preliminary design stages of a new construction project and by offering our design
services that combine our global expertise and knowledge of local codes and standards, we can increase our value to customers relative to many smaller local and regional competitors. With respect to
fire detection and suppression installations, we prefer to become involved at the time an architectural or engineering design firm is selected. With respect to security system design and installation,
we generally become involved in the later stages of a construction project or as tenants take occupancy.

Our
relationships with customers in the aftermarket may include any combination of alarm monitoring, fire and security maintenance and or testing and inspection services. We also provide
aftermarket services to many customers whose fire and security systems were manufactured or installed by third parties.



Global Products

Our Global Products segment designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including intrusion
security, anti-theft devices, breathing apparatus, and access control and video management systems.

Fire Protection Products

Fire Protection Products designs, manufactures, distributes and sells fire alarm and fire detection systems, automatic fire sprinkler
systems and special hazard suppression systems, including many of the fire protection products that our Installation & Services segments install and service. Fire Protection Products also
manufactures and sells grooved products for the rapid joining of piping in both the fire and non-fire markets. Fire Protection Products are marketed under various leading trade names,
including

Simplex, Wormald, Ansul, Grinnell and Tyco

and include fire alarm control panels, advanced fire alarm monitoring systems, smoke, heat and
carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems. Fire Protection Products also offers a wide range of water-based sprinkler systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems, which
incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases. These systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications, including
oil and gas, power generation, mining, petrochemical, manufacturing, transportation, data processing, telecommunications, commercial food preparation and marine applications.

Fire
Protection Products' systems typically are purchased by facility owners through construction engineers and electrical contractors as well as mechanical or general contractors. In
recent years, retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems, especially in hotels, restaurants,
healthcare facilities and educational establishments. In September 2008, the International Residential Code Council, a non-profit association that develops model codes that are the
predominant building and fire safety regulations used by state and local jurisdictions in the United States, adopted a proposal advanced by firefighters and other life-safety advocates
that requires sprinkler systems in new one and two family dwellings as of January 2011. This national code is not binding on state and local jurisdictions and must be adopted locally before it becomes
mandatory for new homes being built in these areas. The timing of adoption, if at all, will vary by jurisdiction. However, we believe that this
development may offer opportunities to expand our residential fire suppression business in the United States.

Security Products

Security Products designs and manufactures a wide array of electronic security products, including integrated video surveillance and
access control systems to enable businesses to manage their security and enhance business performance. Our global access control solutions include integrated security management systems for enterprise
applications, access control solutions applications, alarm management panels, door controllers, readers, keypads and cards. Our global video system solutions include digital video management systems,
matrix switchers and controllers, digital multiplexers, programmable cameras, monitors and liquid crystal interactive displays. Our security products for homes and businesses range from basic burglar
alarms to comprehensive interactive security systems including alarm control panels, keypads, sensors and central station receiving equipment used in security monitoring centers. Our offerings also
include anti-theft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry. Our security products are marketed under various leading
trade names, including

Software House, DSC, American Dynamics, Sensormatic and Visonic

. Many of the world's leading retailers use our

Sensormatic

anti-theft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft. Security Products manufactures many of the security
products that our Installation & Services business installs and services.



Life Safety Products

Life Safety Products manufactures life safety products, including self-contained breathing apparatus designed for
firefighter, industrial and military use, supplied air respirators, air-purifying respirators, thermal imaging cameras, gas detection equipment, gas masks and personal protection
equipment. The Life Safety Products business operates under various leading trade names, including

Scott Safety

and

Protector

. Our breathing apparatus are
used by the military forces of several countries and many U.S. firefighters rely on the

Scott Air-Pak

brand of self-contained breathing apparatus.

Customers

Global Products sells products through our Installation & Service segments and indirect distribution channels around the world.
Some of Global Products' channel business partners act as dealers selling to smaller fire and security contractors that install fire detection and suppression, security and theft protection systems,
whereas others act as integrators that install the products themselves. Builders, contractors and developers are customers for our sprinkler products. End customers for our breathing apparatus and
related products include fire departments, municipal and state governments and military forces as well as major companies in the industrial sector.

Competition

The markets that we serve are generally highly competitive and fragmented with a small number of large, global firms and thousands of
smaller regional and local companies. Competition is based on price, specialized product capacity, breadth of product line, training, support and delivery, with the relative importance of these
factors varying depending on the project complexity, product line, the local market and other factors. Rather than compete primarily on price, we emphasize the quality of our products and services,
the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of customers' fire and security needs. Among large industrial, commercial, governmental and institutional customers, we believe that our comprehensive
global coverage and product and service offerings provide a competitive advantage. We also believe that our systems integration capabilities, which allow us to offer global solutions to customers that
fully integrate our security and/or fire offerings into existing information technology networks, business operations and management tools, and process automation and control systems, set us apart
from all but a small number of other large, global competitors.

Competitive
dynamics in the fire and security industry generally result in more direct competition and lower margins for installation projects compared to aftermarket products and
services. We generally face the greatest competitive pricing pressure for the installation of products that have become more commoditized over time, including standard commercial sprinkler systems and
closed-circuit television systems.

Backlog

See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information relating to
our backlog.

Intellectual Property

Patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets,
manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights,
including trademarks, patents and patent applications, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing
opportunities and misappropriation of our proprietary rights, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.



We
own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to: electronic security systems; fire protection products and systems, including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical,
gas, foam and water agents; personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards; integrated systems for surveillance and control of public transportation and other public works. We
also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and
the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use
of the marks.

While
we consider our patents to be valuable assets that help prevent or delay the commoditization of our products and thus extend their life cycles, we do not believe that our overall
operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. We share the ADT® trademark with ADT and operate under a brand governance agreement between the two companies.
For further details, see the description under "Trademark Agreement" under Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.

Research and Development

We are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety
and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate. For example, in
order to position ourselves to participate in and lead the development of residential interactive platforms, enterprise-wide integrated access control platforms and transition IP video
platforms, we have made significant investments in our security products portfolio. In addition, we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for
possible investment. Our research and development expense was $145 million in 2012, $129 million in 2011 and $113 million in 2010 related to new product development.

Raw and Other Purchased Materials

We are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including fuel for our vehicle fleet. We purchase materials from a large number
of independent sources around the world and have experienced no shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. We enter into long-term supply contracts, using fixed
or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions. Significant changes in certain raw material, including steel, brass and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression
agents, may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins.

Governmental Regulation and Supervision

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in
areas such as: consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states in which we
operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. Our security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone
service to communicate signals. Wireline and wireless telephone companies in the United States are regulated by the federal and state governments. In addition, government regulation of fire safety
codes can impact our fire businesses. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our
worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.



Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other
things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals. We have received notification from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible
remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of
current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.

Given
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods, the ultimate cost of cleanup at
disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict. Based upon our experience, current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws, we concluded that it is probable
that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $48 million to $60 million as of September 28, 2012. As of September 28, 2012, we concluded that the best
estimate within this range is approximately $50 million, of which $43 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $7 million is included in other liabilities
in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of September 28, 2012, we employed more than 70,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 20,000 were employed in the
United States and approximately 50,000 were outside the United States. Approximately 10,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our
relations with the labor unions are generally good.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The
risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as technological obsolescence, labor relations, geopolitical
events, climate change and international operations.

Risks Relating to Our Businesses

General economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of
certain markets that we serve. For example, demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial and residential construction, industrial capital expenditures for
facility expansions and maintenance and the amount of discretionary business and consumer spending, each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality. Even if demand for our products is
not negatively affected, the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full and/or on a timely basis.

Much
of the demand for installation of security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility
expansion and maintenance projects. Commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for commercial and residential real estate
and availability of credit. Many commercial and residential real estate markets have experienced excess capacity since the beginning of the global financial crisis, and in some markets demand may not
improve significantly for years, if at all. In addition, most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing from banks and other institutional lenders in order to
initiate and complete projects. The decline in real estate values in many parts of the world that accompanied the global financial crisis has led to significant reductions in the availability of
project financing, even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction. These factors have in turn hampered demand for new fire detection and suppression and security
installations.

Levels
of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions, economic conditions within specific industries we serve,
expectations of future market behavior and available financing. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of
capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders.

The
businesses of many of our industrial customers, particularly oil and gas companies, chemical and petrochemical companies and general industrial companies, are to varying degrees
cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns. During such economic downturns, customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects, including greenfield
construction, expensive



maintenance
projects and upgrades. Additionally, demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts, as our customers
may be more conservative in their capital planning, which may reduce demand for our products and services. Although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real
estate developers, disruptions in financial markets and banking systems, could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access, and could raise the cost of new debt for our
customers to prohibitive levels. Any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects, including necessary
maintenance and upgrades, even during periods of favorable end-market conditions.

Many
of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors, including governmental and institutional customers, have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue,
including tax receipts, general obligation and construction bonds, endowments and donations, have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions. These budgetary constraints have in the past
and may in the future reduce demand for our products among governmental and institutional customers.

Reduced
demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our
absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We face competition in each of our businesses, which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our
products. If we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global market-place, our operating results may be adversely affected.

We operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service
providers, both domestically and on a global basis. Our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in Asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from
alternative service providers around the world. Currently, key components of our competitive position are our ability to bring to market industry-leading products and services, to adapt to changing
competitive environments and to manage
expenses successfully. These factors require continuous management focus on maintaining our competitive position through technological innovation, cost reduction, productivity improvement and a
regular appraisal of our asset portfolio. If we are unable to maintain our position as a market leader, or to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or cost-effectiveness, or if we are
otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products, services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed
and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.

Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by evolving industry standards. Although many of our largest
competitors are also global industrial companies, we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours,
particularly in emerging markets, or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate. We have found that in several emerging markets potential
customers prefer local suppliers, in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses.



Accordingly,
our future success depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to: adapt our products, services, organization, workforce and sales strategies to fit localities
throughout the world, particularly in high growth emerging markets; identify emerging technological and other trends in our target end-markets; and develop or acquire, manufacture and
bring competitive products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively. Adapting our businesses to serve more local markets will require us to invest considerable resources in
building our distribution channels and engineering and manufacturing capabilities in those markets to ensure that we can address customer demand. Even when we invest in growing our business in local
markets, we may not be successful for any number of reasons, including competitive pressure from regional and local businesses that may have superior local capabilities or products that are produced
more locally at lower cost. Our ability to develop or acquire new products and services can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These acquisitions and
development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies, products or services on a timely basis. Moreover,
as we introduce new products, we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use, which could result in loss of sales or delays in
market acceptance. Even after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products. As a result, these products
may not achieve market acceptance and our brand images could suffer. In addition, the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as
we anticipate. As a result, the failure to effectively adapt our products and services to the needs of local markets, the failure of our technology, products or services to gain market acceptance, the
potential for product defects or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions, or system failure, than may be inherent in other businesses.

If a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or
omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure, he or she may pursue legal action against us, and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be
substantial. In particular, because our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property, we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that
provide other consumer and small business products and services. We could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as
expected. The nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. In an attempt to reduce this risk, our
installation, service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances. However, in the event of litigation with respect to such matters,
it is possible that these limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable.

We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business.

Our business operates and serves consumers worldwide. There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally,
including:

•

economic volatility and the current global economic recession;

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets, especially our intellectual property
rights, through non-U.S. legal systems;

•

possibility of unfavorable circumstances from host country laws or regulations;



•

fluctuations in revenues, operating margins and other financial measures due to currency exchange rate fluctuations and
restrictions on currency and earnings repatriation;

•

trade protection measures, import or export restrictions, licensing requirements and local fire and security codes and
standards;

•

increased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of foreign operations as a result
of distance as well as language and cultural differences;

•

issues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations;

•

potentially adverse tax developments;

•

longer payment cycles;

•

changes in the general political, social and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in
emerging markets;

•

the threat of nationalization and expropriation;

•

the presence of corruption in certain countries; and

•

fluctuations in available municipal funding in those instances where a project is government financed.

One
or more of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

In
order to manage our day-to-day operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. In addition, we are
required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. We also must communicate and monitor standards and
directives across our global network. Our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and
to enforce compliance with standards and procedures, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

A significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar. Certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure have undergone significant devaluation in the past, which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets, reduce the U.S.
dollar value of our local cash flow and potentially reduce the U.S. dollar value of future local net income. Although we intend to enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of
our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

In
addition, we are a large buyer of metals and other non-metal commodities, including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet, the prices of
which have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services. We may not
be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. Further, in a declining price environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first-out method.



We
monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we may enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these
fluctuations. These hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing business. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or
consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.

We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our
industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates
in the future. Nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful.

Acquisitions
and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:

•

diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;

•

difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;

•

inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;

•

potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships, or key customers of acquired companies or of us;

•

assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and

•

dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked
securities.

It
may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations. Any acquisitions or investments may
ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges.

A significant percentage of our future growth is anticipated to come from emerging markets, and if we are unable to expand our operations in emerging markets, our growth
rate could be negatively affected.

One aspect of our growth strategy is to seek significant growth in emerging markets, including China, India, Latin America and the
Middle East, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets. Emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks than more mature markets, where
legal systems are more developed and familiar to us. In some cases, emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, are
more susceptible to corruption, and are locations where it may be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures. Negative or uncertain political climates in developing and emerging
markets could also adversely affect us.

We
cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks inherent in our growth strategy in emerging markets, including civil unrest,
international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches and failure to maintain compliance with multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be
materially adversely affected.



Failure to maintain and upgrade the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and other information; non-compliance
with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information; or a violation of the Company's privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.

We are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic
information, and, in the normal course of our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers,
stockholders and employees. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information
are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our data, whether by
third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security
policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. In addition, we depend on our
information technology infrastructure for business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Security breaches of this infrastructure
can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. Increasingly, our security products and services are accessed through the Internet, and security
breaches in connection with the delivery of our services via the Internet may affect us and
could be detrimental to our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography
or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services.

We
are continuously upgrading and consolidating our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and
acquiring new systems with new functionality. These types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability
to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently
skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new
systems into our current systems. Our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the
implementation of new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.

If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely
basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may suffer.

We purchase materials, components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain
sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments
may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing
capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market
acceptance and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Failure to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.

Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training, motivating and developing employees, and in particular we strive to
attract, motivate, train and retain qualified engineers and managers to handle the day-to-day operations of a highly diversified organization. Many of our manufacturing
processes, and many of the integrated solutions we offer, are highly technical in nature. Our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire, train and retain engineers and
other technical professionals with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in
emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for resources is intense. Our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to
attract, retain and integrate qualified managers and engineers. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience
declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

We may be required to recognize substantial impairment charges in the future.

Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to assess our goodwill, intangibles and
other long-lived assets periodically to determine whether they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, unfavorable end-market conditions and protracted economic weakness,
unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. We
maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet, and we believe these balances are recoverable. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are
sensitive to change. Impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected with the annual impairment analysis. Future impairment charges could
materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our residential and commercial security businesses may experience higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the
estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers, increasing our depreciation and amortization expense.

If our residential security customers (located outside of North America) or our commercial security customers are dissatisfied with our
products or services and switch to competitive products or services, or disconnect for other reasons, our recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The risk is
more pronounced in times of economic
uncertainty, as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide. We amortize the costs of acquired monitoring contracts and related customer relationships based on the
estimated life of the customer relationships. Internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated. If customer disconnect rates were to rise significantly, we may be
required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Divestitures involve risks,
including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the
potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain



environmental
or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and
other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other
significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force.

We employ more than 70,000 people worldwide. Approximately 15% of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or
works council. Although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work
stoppages recently, no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works council, other groups representing employees or our
employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor. Additionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could
materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our
products.

A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our monitoring and/or manufacturing facilities, could adversely affect our business.

If our operations, particularly at our monitoring facilities and/or manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of
significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes or other reasons, we may be
unable to effectively respond to alarm signals, fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

Interruptions
in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to fill
customer orders, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of
facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under
our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spin-offs of ADT and Tyco Flow Control.

Although we believe that separating the residential and small business security business in the United States and Canada and the flow
control business by means of the spin-offs, and combining the flow control business with Pentair's business, will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to Tyco and
its shareholders, the spin-offs may not provide the results on the scope or on the scale we anticipate or could prove more costly than anticipated, and the assumed benefits of the
spin-offs and the Merger may not be fully realized. Accordingly, the spin-offs and the Merger might not provide Tyco and its shareholders benefits or value in excess of the
benefits and value that might have been created or realized had Tyco retained the residential and small business security business in the United States and Canada and/or the flow control business or
undertaken another strategic alternative



involving
the residential and small business security business in the United States and Canada and/or the flow control business.

We have entered into non-compete and non-solicit agreements with ADT that prohibit us from competing with ADT in the residential and small business
security business in the United States and Canada for two years following the Distributions.

The ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the spin-offs includes
non-compete provisions pursuant to which we are prohibited from competing with ADT in the residential and small business security business in the United States and Canada for two years
from the date of the Distributions. In addition, the ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions preventing us from soliciting ADT's residential and
small business customers in the United States and Canada for two years following the Distributions. This effectively prevents us from expanding our business into the residential and small business
market in the affected markets and jurisdictions during the two years following the Distributions.

We recently re-branded our North American commercial security business to Tyco Integrated Security and no longer own the right to use the ADT® brand
name in the United States and Canada.

Prior to the spin-offs, we re-branded our North American commercial security business to Tyco Integrated
Security. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve name recognition or status under our new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed. The failure of these
initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, resulting in reduced revenues. In addition, as a result of the spin-offs, we own the ADT® brand
name in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Canada, and ADT owns the brand name in the United States and Canada. Although we have entered agreements with ADT designed to protect the value
of the ADT® brand, we cannot assure you that actions taken by ADT will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the United States and Canada. These factors expose us to the
risk that the ADT® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control, including ADT's business conduct in the United States and Canada. Any of
these factors may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters

We are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In the normal course of our business, we are subject to claims and lawsuits, including from time to time claims for damages related to
product liability and warranties, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior, and litigation related to employee
matters and commercial disputes. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. Furthermore, we face exposure to
product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. If any of our products prove to be defective, we may also be required to recall or
redesign such products, which could result in significant unexpected costs. Any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for
liabilities actually incurred.

The
defense of these lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of our management's attention. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become
subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies or suffer from adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.



Our businesses operate in a regulated industry.

Our operations and employees are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local licensing laws, fire and security codes and standards
and other laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards
in the conduct of our business. The loss of such licenses, or the imposition of conditions to the granting or retention of such licenses, could have an adverse effect on us. Furthermore, our systems
generally must meet fire and building codes in order to be installed, and it is possible that our current or future products will fail to meet such codes,
which could require us to make costly modifications to our products or to forgo marketing in certain jurisdictions.

Changes
in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations.
In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations were to change or
if we or our products failed to comply, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Our international operations are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations.

Due to the international scope of our operations, the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes
regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and
various non U.S. governmental agencies, including applicable export controls, customs, currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations, as applicable. No assurances can be made that we will
continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future
regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws outside the United States.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial
increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and
individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in
certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure
construction and energy production, they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from
reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe
that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the
relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which
could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.



Furthermore,
we recently settled charges related to alleged FCPA violations with the DOJ and SEC and agreed to pay approximately $26 million in fines, disgorgement and prejudgment
interest to the DOJ and SEC. In connection with the settlement, we entered into a consent with the SEC and a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, and a subsidiary of ours (which is no longer part
of Tyco as a result of the 2012 Separation) pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Pursuant to the non-prosecution agreement, we have acknowledged that a number of
our subsidiaries made payments, both directly and indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain and retain business with private and state-owned entities, and falsely described the payments
in the subsidiaries' books, records and accounts. The non-prosecution agreement also acknowledges Tyco's timely, voluntary and complete disclosure to the DOJ, and our cooperation with the
DOJ's investigation—including a global internal investigation concerning bribery and related misconduct—and extensive remediation. Under the non-prosecution
agreement, we have also agreed to cooperate with and report periodically to the DOJ concerning our compliance efforts, and to continue to implement an enhanced compliance program and internal controls
designed to prevent and detect FCPA violations. Notwithstanding our settlement of the DOJ and SEC investigations, we may be subject to allegations of FCPA violations in the future, and we may be
subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of our entry into the non-prosecution agreement or otherwise as a result of these
compliance matters. If so, or if we are unable to comply with the provisions of the non-prosecution agreement, we may be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the DOJ or
SEC. In such a case, we could be subject to material fines, injunctions on future conduct, the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts,
including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us.

Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. From time
to time, we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports. Our policy mandates strict compliance with U.S. and international trade laws. When we
receive information alleging improper
activity, our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities. Nonetheless, we cannot provide
assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate U.S. and/or foreign laws. Such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal
penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and our business prospects.

We are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install. These claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our
profitability.

We face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In
addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products, which could result in significant unexpected costs. Any insurance we maintain may not be
available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition, we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected. The nature of the services
we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. In an attempt to reduce this risk, our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts
contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these limitations will be



enforced.
Losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are party to asbestos-related product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We and certain of our subsidiaries, along with numerous other companies, are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on
alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products
that either contained asbestos or were attached
to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. While we have observed an increase in the
number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and,
as a result, have been dismissed by the courts. The Company's historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling
suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future. In addition, we
continue to assess our strategy for resolving asbestos claims. Due to the number of claims and limited amount of assets at one of the Company's non-operating subsidiaries, the Company is
pursuing alternatives for this subsidiary, including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all current and future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary. While the company has not
finalized its approach, if the Company is ultimately successful with this alternative, it will likely assign rights to certain insurance assets and make a cash payment in order to fully resolve the
claims against the subsidiary. Unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We
currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and claims estimated to be received over the next fifteen years, including related defense costs, based on a number
of key assumptions and estimation methodologies. These assumptions are derived from claims experience over the past three years and reflect our expectations about future claim activities over the next
fifteen years. These assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate, and accordingly, we may incur additional liabilities in the future. A change in one or more of the inputs or the
methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims. Although it is possible that the
Company will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond the next fifteen years, we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time. On a quarterly and
annual basis, we perform analyses to review and update as appropriate, the underlying assumptions.

We
also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities. There are significant
assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestos-related recoveries, such as policy triggers, policy or contract interpretation, success in litigation in certain cases, the methodology for
allocating claims to policies, and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties. The assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate, and as a result, actual
performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs. Due to these uncertainties, as well as our inability
to reasonably estimate any additional asbestos liability for claims that may be filed beyond the next fifteen years, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the cost, nor potential
recoveries, of resolving the pending and all unasserted asbestos claims. Additionally, we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond the next fifteen years, net of expected
recoveries, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws
governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;

•

investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally
charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.

We
have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies, that conditions at several sites where we and others disposed
of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the
government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate
and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties. These projects relate primarily to a variety of
activities, including:

•

solvent, oil, metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and

•

structure decontamination and demolition, including asbestos abatement.

These
projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold
by us.

The
ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for
future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and
safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. We may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or
future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware.

We depend on third-party licenses for our products and services.

We rely on certain software technology that we license from third parties and use in our products and services to perform key functions
and provide critical functionality, particularly in our commercial security business. Because our products and services incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties we are, to a
certain extent, dependent upon such third parties' ability to maintain or



enhance
their current products and services, to ensure that their products are free of defects or security vulnerabilities, to develop new products and services on a timely and
cost-effective basis, and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. Further, these third-party technology licenses may not always be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our agreements with third-party vendors are not renewed or the third-party software fails to address the needs of our software products and services, we
would be required to find alternative software products and services or technologies of equal performance or functionality. We cannot assure that we would be able to replace the functionality provided
by third-party software if we lose the license to this software, it becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products and services or is otherwise not adequately maintained or
updated. Furthermore, even if we obtain licenses to alternative software products or services that provide the functionality we need, we may be required to replace hardware installed at our monitoring
centers and at our customers' sites, including security system control panels and peripherals, in order to effect our integration of or migration to alternative software products. Any of these factors
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, could negatively
affect us.

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions and
licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot guarantee, however, that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent
infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be
unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade
secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade
secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any
proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and
manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent
protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could
suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In
addition, we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties. The litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties, and we may not
prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position. Intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become
extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows

Legislative action by the U.S. Congress could adversely affect us.

Legislative action could be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties, or modify statutes or
regulations, upon which we rely, which could materially adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. If proposals were
enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Switzerland or limiting our ability as a Swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between Switzerland and the United States,
we could be subject to increased taxation.



Police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies.

Police departments in a limited number of U.S. cities do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies, either as a
matter of policy or by local ordinance. We have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies, in most cases through contracts with us, which increases the
overall cost to customers. If more police departments, whether inside or outside the U.S., were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service
companies, our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Liquidity and Financial Markets

Disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us, our customers and our suppliers, by increasing our funding costs or reducing the availability of
credit.

In the normal course of our business, we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of
indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries. Although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to
meet our foreseeable needs, our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets. In 2009 and 2010, credit markets experienced significant
dislocations and liquidity disruptions, and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable. These factors may make it more difficult or
expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to
commence new projects, as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. Disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse
effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses. These disruptions may have other unknown adverse
effects. Based on these conditions, our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit agreements contain customary financial covenants, including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt. In addition, the indentures governing our bonds contain customary covenants including limits on negative
pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot
provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of default
under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of credit
facility lenders, terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets
to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness. Furthermore, acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to
accelerate their obligations, which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our
outstanding indebtedness.

We estimate that our available cash, our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facilities will be
adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the



foreseeable
future. However, material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding. If such developments
require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Such
an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other corporate purposes, including dividend payments;

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and

•

increase the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.

We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial health, and may decrease our profitability.

We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow
from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms
acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital stock, the terms of the debt or capital stock issued may give the holders rights,
preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on
our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, your percentage ownership in us would decline. If we are unable to raise additional capital when
needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect your investment in us.

Risks Relating to Tax Matters

Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these
examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular, with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 Separation. We are reviewing and
contesting certain of the proposed tax
adjustments. Although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the IRS, a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997
through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany transactions during the
period related to the audits, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, we may be required to litigate these matters. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in
the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues
in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected



net
of related tax loss carry-forwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We have assessed our obligations under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and determined
that the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement. However, such amount could differ materially from amounts that are actually determined to be
due, and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We share responsibility for certain of our, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.

In connection with the 2007 Separation, Tyco entered into a tax sharing agreement (the "2007 Tax Sharing Agreement") that
governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre-2007 Separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the
2007 Separation. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to
Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the
2007 Separation. In addition, in the event the 2007 Separation, or certain related transactions, is determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 Separation
by Tyco, Covidien, or TE Connectivity, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien, or TE Connectivity as a result thereof. If none of the
companies is responsible for such failure, then Tyco, Covidien, and TE Connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities
under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties.

If
any party to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault,
each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the 2007 Tax Sharing
Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax
law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our,
Covidien's and TE Connectivity's tax liabilities.

As
noted above, with respect to years prior to and including the 2007 Separation, tax authorities have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments that are generally subject to the
sharing provisions of the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and which may require Tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority, Covidien or TE Connectivity. Tyco has recorded a liability as of
September 28, 2012 which it has assessed and believes is adequate to cover the payments that Tyco may be required to make under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. However, the ultimate resolution
of these matters is uncertain and could result in Tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement.

We share responsibility for certain of our, Pentair's and ADT's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the Distribution date.

In connection with the Distributions, we entered into the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement with Pentair and ADT that is separate from the
2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and which govern the rights and obligations of Tyco, ADT and Pentair for certain tax liabilities before the Distributions, including Tyco's obligations under the 2007 Tax
Sharing Agreement. Under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement Tyco, Pentair and ADT share (i) certain pre-Distribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax
authorities to ADT's U.S., Tyco Flow Control's and Tyco's income tax returns, and (ii) payments required to be made by Tyco with respect to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, excluding
approximately $175 million of pre-2012 Separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be



paid
prior to the 2012 Separation (collectively, "Shared Tax Liabilities"). Tyco will be responsible for the first $500 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Pentair and ADT will share 42% and
58%, respectively, of the next $225 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Tyco, Pentair and ADT will share 52.5% 20% and 27.5%, respectively, of Shared Tax Liabilities above $725 million.
All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20%, 27.5%, and 52.5% by Pentair, ADT and Tyco, respectively. As of September 28,
2012, Tyco established liabilities representing the fair market value of its obligations under the 2012 Tax Sharing Arrangement which is recorded in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheet with an offset to Tyco shareholders' equity. In addition, we entered into a non-income tax sharing agreement with ADT in
connection with the ADT Distribution. To the extent we are responsible for any liability under these agreements, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

The
2012 Tax Sharing Agreement provides that, if any party were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of certain taxes that may arise as a result of the failure
of the Distributions to be tax free (such taxes, as defined in the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, "Distribution Taxes"), each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any
other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were
to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly,
under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Pentair's and ADT's tax liabilities.

If the Distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distributions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we,
our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or both ADT and Pentair could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

Tyco has received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Distributions to the
effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Distributions will qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and/or 361 of the Code, except for cash received in lieu of a
fractional share of ADT common stock or of Pentair common shares. The private letter ruling also provides that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distributions will
qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter ruling, Tyco has received an opinion from the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP
confirming the tax-free status of the Distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain
representations and undertakings, from us, Pentair and ADT regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters.

Notwithstanding
the private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distributions or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions
if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the Distributions or the internal transactions should be taxable for
other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership (which might take into account changes in Pentair stock ownership resulting from the Merger) or asset ownership after the
Distributions. An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the
opinions will be based on current law, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the Distributions ultimately are determined to be taxable, the Distributions could
be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and you could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we would recognize gain
in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
Pentair common shares and the shares of ADT common stock distributed to our shareholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally



would
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we, Pentair or ADT could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal
transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distributions are taxable.

In
addition, under the terms of the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event the Distributions or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken
after the Distributions by us, Pentair or ADT, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us, Pentair or ADT as a result thereof. If such failure is not the
result of actions taken after the Distributions by us, Pentair or ADT, then we, Pentair and ADT will share the liability in the manner and according to the sharing percentages set forth in the 2012
Tax Sharing Agreement. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that any party to the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay Distribution Taxes to another party that
arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect
of such other party's taxes.

If the Distributions or the Merger are determined to be taxable for Swiss withholding tax purposes, we, ADT and Pentair could incur significant Swiss withholding tax
liabilities.

Generally, Swiss withholding tax of 35% is due on dividends and similar distributions to Tyco's shareholders, regardless of the place
of residency of the shareholder. As of January 1, 2011, distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus accumulated on or after January 1, 1997 are exempt from Swiss
withholding tax, if certain conditions are met (

Kapitaleinlageprinzip

). Tyco has obtained a ruling from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration confirming
that the Distributions qualify as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount will be withheld by Tyco when making the Distributions.

We
have obtained tax rulings from the Swiss Tax Administrations confirming that the Merger is a transaction that is generally tax-free for Swiss federal, cantonal, and
communal tax purposes (including with respect to Swiss stamp tax and Swiss withholding tax). However, these tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and
undertakings, from Tyco. Notwithstanding these tax rulings, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration could determine on audit that the Distributions or the Merger should be treated as a taxable
transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. If the Distributions
or the Merger ultimately are determined to be taxable
for withholding tax or other tax purposes, Tyco and Tyco shareholders could incur material Swiss withholding tax liabilities that could significantly detract from, or eliminate, the benefits of the
Distributions and the Merger. In addition, Tyco could become liable to indemnify Pentair for part of any Swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement.

We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the Distributions because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income
tax requirements for tax-free distributions.

Our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the Distributions in order to preserve,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Distributions. Even if the Distributions otherwise qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of
the Code, it may result in corporate-level gain to Tyco and certain of its affiliates under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our shares, Pentair's shares or ADT's
shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distributions. Any acquisitions or issuances of our shares, Pentair's shares or ADT's shares within
two years after the Distributions generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan, although we, Pentair or ADT may be able to rebut that presumption.

To
preserve the tax-free treatment to us of the Distributions, under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement that we entered with Pentair and ADT, we are prohibited from taking or
failing to take any action that prevents the Distributions and related transactions from being tax-free. Further, for the



two-year
period following the Distributions, without obtaining the consent of Pentair and ADT, a private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law
firm, we may be prohibited from:

•

approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than 35% of our common shares when
combined with any other changes in ownership of our common shares,

•

redeeming equity securities,

•

selling or otherwise disposing of more than 35% of our assets, or

•

engaging in certain internal transactions.

These
restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the 2012
Tax Sharing Agreement also provides that we will be responsible for any taxes imposed on Pentair or any of its affiliates or on ADT or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the
Distributions or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Distributions by or in respect of us,
any of our affiliates or our shareholders.

Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation in Switzerland

Swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of Tyco's securities.

Because of differences between Swiss law and U.S. state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of Swiss
companies and those incorporated in the U.S., it may not be possible to enforce in Switzerland, court judgments obtained in the United States against Tyco based on the civil liability provisions of
the federal or state securities laws of the United States. As a result, in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, U.S. investors may find it
difficult to:

•

effect service within the United States upon Tyco or its directors and officers located outside the United States;

•

enforce judgments obtained against those persons in U.S. courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States;
and

•

enforce against those persons in Switzerland, whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments
of U.S. courts, civil liabilities based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws.

Original
actions against persons in Switzerland based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws are governed, among other things, by the principles set forth in the Swiss
Federal Act on International Private Law. This statute provides that the application of provisions of non-Swiss law by the courts in Switzerland shall be precluded if the result was
incompatible with Swiss public policy. Also, mandatory provisions of Swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply.

Switzerland
and the United States do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The recognition and
enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the United States in Switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law. This statute provides in
principle that a judgment rendered by a non-Swiss court may be enforced in Switzerland only if:

•

the foreign court had jurisdiction pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law;

•

the judgment of such foreign court has become final and non-appealable;

•

the judgment does not contravene Swiss public policy;



•

the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law;
and

•

no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in Switzerland, or adjudicated in
Switzerland, or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in Switzerland.

Our status as a Swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions or
repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax, or at all.

Swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the Board of Directors without additional
shareholder approval, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years. Our current authorized share capital
will expire on March 9, 2013. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares. Swiss law also
does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. In the event we need to raise common equity capital at
a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares (currently CHF 6.70 (or approximately $7.14 based on the exchange rate in effect on October 1, 2012)), we
will need to obtain approval of shareholders to decrease the par value of our shares. As of October 1, 2012, the closing price of our ordinary shares on the NYSE was $28.50. We cannot provide
assurance that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval in a timely manner. Obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convening a
meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority
in some other jurisdictions. For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may
arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.

Under
Swiss law, a Swiss corporation may pay dividends only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from previous fiscal years, or if the corporation has distributable
reserves, each as evidenced by its audited statutory balance sheet. Distributable reserves are generally booked either as "free reserves" or as "contributed surplus" (contributions received from
shareholders) in the "reserve from capital contributions." Furthermore, generally, Swiss withholding tax of 35% is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders, regardless of the
place of residency of the shareholder, unless the distribution is made to shareholders (i) by way of a reduction of par value or (ii) assuming certain conditions are met, out of
qualifying contributed surplus (Kapitaleinlage) accumulated on or after January 1, 1997. Payments may be made out of registered share capital—the aggregate par value of a company's
registered shares—only by way of a capital reduction.
Tyco's freely distributable reserves based on its Swiss statutory account for fiscal year 2012 are CHF 2.0 billion, and its registered share capital is approximately
CHF 3.3 billion. Tyco's freely distributable reserves will be reduced by any additional distributions approved by our shareholders, including any ordinary cash dividends approved by our
shareholders at the annual general meeting in March 2013.

If
we are not successful in our efforts to make dividends through a reduction of par value or out of qualifying contributed surplus, then any dividends paid by us generally will be
subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits
under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, which we refer to as the "U.S.-Swiss
Treaty," may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation
in our voting stock, or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds). Even if we are able to pay dividends in the future,



there
can be no assurance that we will meet the requirements to pay such dividends free from Swiss withholding tax or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future. We cannot provide
assurance that the current Swiss law with respect to distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus will not be changed or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our
shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. There are currently motions pending
in the Swiss Parliament that purport to limit the distribution of qualifying contributed surplus. In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available to us for par value reductions and
the amount of qualifying contributed surplus available to us to pay out as distributions is limited.

Under
present Swiss tax laws, repurchases of shares for the purposes of cancellation are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between
the repurchase price and the par value except, since January 1, 2011, to the extent attributable to qualifying contributed surplus
(

Kapitaleinlagereserven

) if any. If, and to the extent that, the repurchase of shares is out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves, the Swiss
withholding becomes due. No partial liquidation treatment applies, and no withholding tax is triggered, if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares. However,
should such treasury shares remain in treasury for six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

Our locations include research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, warehouse and distribution centers and sales and
service offices. Additionally, our locations include approximately 30 monitoring call centers located around the world. All of our monitoring facilities operate 24 hours a day on a
year-round basis. Incoming alarm signals are routed via an internal communications network to the next available operator. Operators are quickly updated with information including the name
and location of the customer and site, and the nature of the alarm signal. Depending upon the type of service specified by the customer contract, operators respond to emergency-related alarms by
calling the customer by telephone (for verification purposes) and relaying information to local fire or police departments, as necessary. Additional action may be taken by the operators as needed,
depending on the specific situation.

We
operate from approximately 1,200 locations in more than 50 countries. These properties total approximately 15 million square feet, of which 3 million square feet are
owned and 12 million square feet are leased.

NA
Installation & Services operates through a network of offices, service and manufacturing facilities and warehouse and distribution centers located in North America. The group
occupies approximately 4 million square feet, the majority of which is leased.

ROW
Installation & Services operates through a network of offices, manufacturing facilities and warehouse and distribution centers located in Central America, South America,
Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. The group occupies approximately 5 million square feet, of which 1 million square feet are owned and
4 million square feet are leased.

Global
Products has manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers throughout North America, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the
Asia-Pacific region. The group occupies approximately 6 million square feet, of which 2 million square feet are owned and 4 million square feet are leased.

In
the opinion of management, our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing
leases as they



expire
or in finding alternative facilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our operating lease obligations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

The Company is a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management, including its former chief executive officer,
Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, its former chief financial officer, Mr. Mark Swartz and a former director, Mr. Frank Walsh Jr. The Company has filed civil complaints against
Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to alleged abuses of the Company's Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program,
unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self dealing transactions and other improper conduct. In connection with Tyco's affirmative actions against Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz,
Mr. Kozlowski, through counterclaims, and Mr. Swartz, through a separate lawsuit, are seeking an aggregate of approximately $140 million allegedly due in connection with their
compensation and retention arrangements and under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). Mr. Walsh is seeking indemnification for legal and other expenses incurred by him in
connection with the Company's affirmative action against him for breaches of fiduciary duties.

With
respect to Mr. Kozlowski, on December 1, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of several of the Company's affirmative
claims against him before trial, while dismissing all of Mr. Kozlowski's counterclaims for pay and benefits after 1995. Prior to the commencement of trial scheduled for August 2012, the parties
reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter, with Mr. Kozlowski agreeing to release the Company from any claims to monetary amounts related to compensation, retention or other
arrangements alleged to have existed between him and the Company. Although the parties have reached an agreement in principle, until the settlement agreement is signed, the Company will continue to
maintain the amounts recorded in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, which reflect a net liability of approximately $91 million, for the amounts allegedly due under his compensation and retention
arrangements and under ERISA.

With
respect to Mr. Swartz, on March 3, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the Company's motion for summary judgment as to
liability for its affirmative actions and further ruled that issues related to damages would need to be resolved at trial. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reversed a
$50 million liability related to Mr. Swartz's pay and benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations. On May 15, 2012, Mr. Swartz filed a lawsuit against Tyco in New York state court claiming entitlement to monies under ERISA. The Company removed
the case to the U.S. district court for the Southern District of New York and filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Swartz's claims for multiple reasons, including that the statute of limitations had
expired, at the latest, during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. A trial to determine the Company's damages from Swartz's breaches of fiduciary duty concluded on October 17, 2012. At the
conclusion of the trial, the Court ruled that the Company was entitled to recover all monies earned by Swartz in connection with his employment by Tyco between September 1, 1995 and
June 1, 2002. The Company filed a motion requesting the entry of monetary sum certain judgment in conformity with the Court's ruling regarding the time period of disgorgement. In connection
with Swartz's affirmative claims against the Company, the Court dismissed all of Swartz's claims except one claim in which Swartz contends he is entitled to reimbursement from the Company for taxes he
paid in connection with his 2002 Separation Agreement. The Court has not opined on the merits of this claim, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend this claim.

With
respect to Mr. Walsh, in June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against him for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related wrongful
conduct involving a $20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The payment
was purportedly made for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging the Company's acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh



pleaded
guilty to a felony violation of New York law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York County) and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the
SEC in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Both the felony charge and the civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such payment. The felony charge
accused Mr. Walsh of intentionally concealing information concerning the payment from Tyco's directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities in the State of New York.
The SEC action alleged that Mr. Walsh knew that the registration statement covering the sale of Tyco securities as part of the CIT Group acquisition contained a material misrepresentation
concerning fees payable in connection with the acquisition. Pursuant to the plea and settlement, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on December 17, 2002. In October
2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the Company's affirmative claims for recovery of damages against Mr. Walsh. In January 2012, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's ruling that Tyco's Board of Directors could ratify breaches of fiduciary duties owed by Mr. Walsh to Tyco's shareholders, and
remanded the case to the District Court to resolve certain issues relating to consequential damages. On June 20, 2012, the District Court ruled in Tyco's favor and entered a judgment against
Mr. Walsh. Separately, Mr. Walsh is pursuing a New York state court claim against the Company asserting his entitlement to indemnification. Any judgment against the Company
related to this matter would be shared with Covidien and TE Connectivity under the agreements governing the 2007 Separation.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative
cleanup methods. As of September 28, 2012, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $48 million to $60 million. As of
September 28, 2012, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $50 million, of which $43 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities
and $7 million is included in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company
believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos Matters

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits
based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial
products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third-parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate
defendants. While the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large
percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a result, have been dismissed by the courts. The Company's historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at
having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, the Company cannot predict the extent
to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future. In addition, the Company continues to assess its strategy for resolving asbestos claims. Due to the number of claims and limited
amount of assets at one of the Company's non-operating subsidiaries, the Company is pursuing alternatives for this subsidiary, including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all
current and future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary. While the company has not finalized its approach, if



the
Company is ultimately successful with this alternative, it will likely assign rights to certain insurance assets and make a cash payment in order to fully resolve the claims against the
subsidiary.

As
of September 28, 2012, the Company has determined that there were approximately 4,900 claims pending against it, its subsidiaries or entities for which the Company has assumed
responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. This amount reflects the Company's current estimate of the number of viable claims made against such entities, and includes adjustments
for claims that are not actively being prosecuted, identify incorrect defendants, are duplicative of other actions or for which the Company is indemnified.

For
a detailed discussion of asbestos-related matters, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Tax Matters

Tyco and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with these
examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 Separation. The issues and proposed
adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement pursuant to which Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%,
respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. The costs
and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. Tyco is reviewing and contesting certain tax adjustments proposed by tax
authorities. With respect to adjustments raised by the IRS, although the Company has resolved a substantial number of these adjustments, a few significant items are expected to remain open with
respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that Tyco will be able to resolve all the open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain
intercompany debt transactions during the period, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, Tyco expects to litigate these matters once it receives the requisite statutory notices from the IRS,
which is expected to occur during fiscal 2013. The Company has assessed its obligations under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and determined that its recorded liability is sufficient to cover the
indemnifications made by the Company under such agreement. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company's financial
position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

For
a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's income taxes, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, the Company has received and responded to various allegations and other
information that certain improper payments were made by the Company's subsidiaries and agents in recent years. On September 24, 2012, the Company settled the charges related to these alleged
improper payments with the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC and agreed to pay approximately $26 million in fines, disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the DOJ and SEC, which the
Company had previously reserved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company expects to make the payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In connection with the settlement, the Company
entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, and a subsidiary of the Company (which is no longer a subsidiary as a result of the 2012 Separation) pleaded guilty to one
count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). Pursuant to the non-prosecution agreement, the Company has acknowledged that a number of its subsidiaries made
payments, both directly and indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain and retain business with private and state-owned entities, and falsely or inaccurately described the payments in the
subsidiaries' books, records and accounts. The non-prosecution agreement also acknowledges the



Company's
timely, voluntary and complete disclosure to the DOJ, and its cooperation with the DOJ's investigation—including a global internal investigation concerning bribery and related
misconduct—and extensive remediation. Under the non-prosecution agreement, the Company has also agreed to cooperate with and report periodically to the DOJ concerning its
compliance efforts, and to continue to implement an enhanced compliance program and internal controls designed to prevent and detect FCPA violations. Notwithstanding the settlement of the DOJ and SEC
investigations, the Company may be subject to allegations of FCPA violations in the future, and we may be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business
with us as a result of our entry into the non-prosecution agreement or otherwise as a result of these compliance matters. If so, or if it is unable to comply with the provisions of the
non-prosecution agreement, it may be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the DOJ or SEC. In such a case, the Company could be subject to material fines, injunctions on
future conduct, the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Covidien
and TE Connectivity agreed, in connection with the 2007 Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its responses regarding these matters, and agreed that liabilities
primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics businesses of the Company would be assigned to Covidien and TE Connectivity, respectively. As a result, Covidien and TE Connectivity have
agreed to contribute approximately $5 million and immaterial amounts, respectively, toward the aforementioned $26 million.

ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic
Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund (the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the Fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan such as the Fund, the
employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between Grinnell Fire
Protection Systems, SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669. Following an adverse arbitration ruling in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company
agreed to settle this matter and recorded a charge in the amount of $28.5 million, including accrued interest on the liability which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses
in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. ERISA requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability
assessment from the plan, and as a result the Company had made $22 million of payments through June 29, 2012. The Company made the remaining $6.5 million of cash payments during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

Other Matters

In addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and product
and general liability claims, incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. With respect to many of these claims, the Company either self-insures or maintains
insurance through third-parties, with varying deductibles. While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of any such
proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows beyond
amounts recorded for such matters.

Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures

Dividends
proposed by Tyco's Board of Directors are subject to shareholder approval. Shareholders approved cash dividends of $0.50
(pre-2012 Separation) and $0.30 (reflecting the impact of the 2012 Separation) at the annual meeting held on March 7, 2012 and the special general meeting held on September 17,
2012, respectively, to be paid in quarterly installments. Shareholders approved an annual dividend of $1.00 (pre-2012 Separation) at the annual meeting held on and March 9, 2011. All
dividends declared thorough the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were denominated in Swiss francs. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, all dividends declared were denominated in U.S. dollars.
Dividends for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 in the table above represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of Swiss francs converted at the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate shortly before the payment
dates.

Dividend Policy

Prior to May 2011, the Company paid dividends in the form of a return of share capital from the Company's registered share capital.
These payments were made free of Swiss withholdings taxes. The Company now makes dividend payments from its contributed surplus equity position. These payments are also made free of Swiss withholding
taxes. Unlike payments made in the form of a reduction to registered share capital, which are required to be denominated in Swiss francs and converted to U.S. dollars at the time of payment, payments
from the contributed surplus account may effectively be denominated in U.S. dollars. Under Swiss law, the authority to declare dividends is vested in the Company's general meeting of shareholders.

We
expect to obtain shareholder approval of the annual dividend amount out of contributed surplus each year at our annual general meeting, and we expect to distribute the approved
dividend amount in four quarterly installments, on dates determined by our Board of Directors. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will depend upon
many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other relevant factors. Future dividends will be
proposed by our Board of Directors and will require shareholder approval.

Average
price paid per share is based on pre-2012 Separation share prices.

The
transactions described in the table above represent shares acquired by the Company from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with
the vesting of restricted shares. 67,652 shares were acquired in these vesting-related transactions during the quarter ended September 28, 2012. The average price paid per share is calculated
by dividing the total cash paid for the shares by the total number of shares repurchased. During the quarter, the Company did not repurchase any common shares on the New York Stock Exchange as part of
the $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in April 2011 ("2011 Share Repurchase Program"). As of September 28, 2012, approximately $200 million
of share repurchases remain authorized under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program.



Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data of Tyco. This data is derived from Tyco's Consolidated Financial
Statements for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. Tyco has a 52 or
53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday in September. Fiscal years 2012, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were all 52-week years, while fiscal 2011 was a 53-week year.

Effective
September 28, 2012, Tyco completed the spin-offs of The ADT Corporation ("ADT") and Pentair Ltd. (formerly known as Tyco Flow Control
International Ltd. ("Tyco Flow Control")), formerly our North American residential security and flow control businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the form of a
distribution to Tyco shareholders. The distribution was made on September 28, 2012, to Tyco shareholders of record on September 17, 2012, the record date. Immediately following the
spin-off, Pentair, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Tyco Flow Control in a tax free all-stock merger (the "Merger"), with Pentair Ltd. ("Pentair") succeeding
Pentair Inc. as an independent publicly traded Company. The distributions, the
Merger and related transactions are collectively referred to herein as the "2012 Separation". As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tyco's former flow control and North American
residential security businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

Prior
year amounts have been recast to reflect the distribution of ADT and Pentair as discontinued operations. In addition, the prior year amounts reflect the correction of certain
immaterial adjustments as described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the
Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but
not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information".

Organization

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the
laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we", the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD"), in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

Effective
September 28, 2012, Tyco completed the spin-offs of The ADT Corporation ("ADT") and Pentair Ltd. (formerly known as Tyco Flow Control
International Ltd. ("Tyco Flow Control")), formerly our North American residential security and flow control businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the form of a
distribution to Tyco shareholders. Immediately following the spin-off, Pentair, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Tyco Flow Control in a tax-free,
all-stock merger ("the Merger"), with Pentair Ltd. ("Pentair") succeeding Pentair Inc. as an independent publicly traded company. The distribution was made on
September 28, 2012, to Tyco shareholders of record on September 17, 2012. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.50 of a common share of ADT and approximately 0.24 of a common share of Pentair
for each Tyco common share held on the record date. The distribution was structured to be tax-free to Tyco shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares.
The distributions, the Merger and related transactions are collectively referred to herein as the "2012 Separation". As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tyco's former flow
control and North American residential security businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

After
giving effect to the 2012 Separation, we operate and report financial and operating information in the following three
segments:

•

North America Systems Installation & Services ("NA Installation &
Services")

designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems and fire detection and suppression systems for commercial, industrial, retail,
institutional and governmental customers in North America.

•

Rest of World Systems Installation & Services ("ROW Installation &
Services")

designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems and fire detection and suppression systems for commercial, industrial, retail,
residential, small business, institutional and governmental customers in the Rest of World ("ROW") regions.

•

Global Products

designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security
and life safety products, including intrusion security, anti-theft devices, breathing apparatus and access control and video management systems, for commercial, industrial, retail,
residential, small business, institutional and governmental customers worldwide, including products installed and serviced by our NA and ROW Installation & Services segments.

We
also provide general corporate services to our segments which will be reported as a fourth, non-operating segment, Corporate and Other. Additionally, Corporate and Other
includes the



Company's
former Electrical and Metal Products business which was divested in the first quarter of 2011.

References
to the segment data are to the Company's continuing operations. As discussed above, as a result of the 2012 Separation, the Company reports under a new segment
structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and accordingly has recast prior period segment amounts. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Overview

We are a leading global provider of security products and services, fire detection and suppression products and services and life
safety products. We utilize our extensive global footprint of over 1,200 locations, including manufacturing facilities, service and distribution centers, monitoring centers and sales offices, to
provide solutions and localized expertise to our global customer base. We provide an extensive range of product and service offerings to over 3 million customers in more than 100 countries
through multiple channels. Our revenues are broadly diversified across the United States and Canada (collectively "North America"); Central America and South America (collectively "Latin America");
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (collectively "EMEA") and the Asia- Pacific region. We refer to Latin America, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific region collectively as "Rest of World"
or "ROW". The following chart reflects our fiscal 2012 net revenue by region.

Fiscal 2012 Net Revenue by Region

Our
end-use customers, to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers, distributors, commercial builders or contractors, are also broadly diversified and
include:

•

Commercial customers, including residential and commercial property developers, financial institutions, food service
businesses and commercial enterprises;

•

Industrial customers, including companies in the oil and gas, power generation, mining, petrochemical and other
industries;

•

Retail customers, including international, regional and local consumer outlets, from national chains to specialty stores;

•

Institutional customers, including a broad range of healthcare facilities, academic institutions, museums and foundations;



•

Governmental customers, including federal, state and local governments, defense installations, mass transportation
networks, public utilities and other government-affiliated entities and applications;

•

Residential and small business customers outside of North America, including owners of single family homes and local
providers of a wide range of goods and services.

As
a global business with a varied customer base and an extensive range of products and services, our operations and results are impacted by global, regional and industry specific
factors, and by political factors. Our geographic diversity and the diversity in our customer base and our products and services has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of
any single country on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Due to the global nature of our business and the variety of our customers, products and services, no
single factor is predominantly used to forecast Company results. Rather, management monitors a number of factors to develop expectations regarding future results, including the activity of key
competitors and customers, order rates for longer lead time projects, and capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers. We also monitor trends throughout the commercial and
residential fire and security markets, including building codes and fire-safety standards. Our commercial installation businesses are impacted by trends in commercial construction starts,
while our residential business, which is located outside of North America, is impacted by new housing starts.

Recent Transactions

As a result of the 2012 Separation, we incurred and expect to continue to incur, separation related costs including debt
refinancing, tax restructuring, professional services, restructuring and impairment charges and employee-related costs. During 2012, the Company incurred pre-tax costs related to the
2012 Separation of $561 million recorded within continuing operations and $278 million within discontinued operations. Costs incurred within continuing operations in fiscal 2012
include a charge of $453 million due to the early extinguishment of debt, as the Company refinanced its long-term debt as a result of the 2012 Separation. During fiscal 2012,
the Company paid $186 million in separation costs, $18 million of which is included within continuing operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we determined that certain aged receivables in our ROW Installation & Services segment related to security contracts in China may not be
collectible. After a formal investigation, we determined that certain records relating to those receivables were falsified by district level employees located in one region of China. We have concluded
that the revenue recognition practices related to the aged receivables, which dated back to fiscal 2008, were inappropriate. We have evaluated and concluded that the identified amounts were not
material to any of our previously issued annual and interim financial statements, including the effects of presenting ADT and Tyco Flow Control as discontinued operations. Although management has
determined the amounts individually and in the aggregate are not material to prior periods, in accordance with authoritative accounting literature on considering the effects of prior year
misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year, the financial statements included herein have been adjusted to correct for the impact of these items.

As
a result, we have revised our previously reported operating results to reflect certain immaterial adjustments, primarily related to revenue recognition and cost of goods sold. These
adjustments reduced previously reported net revenue by approximately $49 million and $37 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, and reduced previously reported operating income
by approximately $14 million and $2 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we reversed approximately
$31 million of net revenue and reduced operating



income
by $17 million during fiscal 2012, of which less than $1 million and $7 million of net revenue and operating income, respectively, were recorded during the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2012.

Net Revenue:

Fiscal

Net
revenue for the year ended September 28, 2012 decreased by $154 million, or 1.5%, to $10.4 billion as compared to net revenue of $10.6 billion for the
year ended September 30, 2011. On an organic basis, net revenue grew by $247 million, or 2.4% year over year, primarily driven by our Global Products segment. Net revenue was unfavorably
impacted by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $71 million, or 0.7%, primarily due to the sale of a majority interest the Company's former Electrical and Metal Products
business, which contributed $347 million of net revenue during the year ended September 30, 2011, partially offset by the acquisitions of Chemguard and Visonic within the Company's
Global Products segment. Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net revenue by $226 million, or 2.1%. In addition, because the Company's fiscal year ends on the last
Friday in September, fiscal 2012 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2011. As a result, fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated $98 million of revenue from the
additional week.

Fiscal 2011

Net
revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 decreased by $463 million, or 4.2%, to $10.6 billion as compared to net revenue of
$11.0 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. On an organic basis, net revenue grew by $465 million, or 4.8% year over year, primarily driven by our Global Products and NA
Installation & Services segments. Net revenue was unfavorably impacted by the net



impact
of acquisitions and divestitures of $1.3 billion, or 11.8%, which was primarily the result of the sale of a majority interest in the Company's former Electrical and Metal Products
business, which contributed approximately $1.4 billion of net revenue during the year ended September 24, 2010 and $347 million during the year ended September 30, 2011.
Net revenue was also unfavorably impacted by
$72 million, or 0.7%, due to the deconsolidation of a joint venture in our ROW Installation & Services segment due to the adoption of an accounting standard. Favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates impacted net revenue by $306 million, or 2.8%. In addition, because the Company's fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September, fiscal 2011 consisted of
53 weeks, as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2010. As a result, fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated $98 million, or 0.9%, of revenue from the additional week.

Operating Income:

Operating income for the year ended September 28, 2012 decreased $297 million, or 30.2%, to $685 million, as
compared to operating income of $982 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. Operating income for the year ended September 28, 2012 declined primarily due to the net gain
on divestitures of $224 million that was recognized in the prior year, primarily related to a $248 million net gain related to the sale of a majority interest in the Company's former
Electrical and Metal products business. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased $367 million, or 59.7%, to $982 million, as compared to operating income
of $615 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 improved due to the net gain on divestitures, pricing initiatives,
improvement in mix driven by project selectivity, as well as the benefit of ongoing cost containment and restructuring actions. Items impacting operating income for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as

Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was $19 million in 2012, as compared to $27 million and $25 million in 2011 and 2010,
respectively. Interest income decreased in 2012 primarily due to decreased investment yields compared to 2011 and 2010.

Interest
expense was $209 million in 2012, as compared to $240 million and $279 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on total
debt outstanding as of September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 was 6.5%, 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively. These decreases in interest expense and fluctuations in
the weighted-average interest rate are primarily related to savings realized from the $2.6 billion debt redemptions in 2012 and from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon
notes during 2011. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effective Income Tax Rate

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended September 28, 2012 was not meaningful primarily as a result of separation
related charges which were incurred for which no tax benefit was recognized, as well as a valuation allowance of $235 million recorded due to net operating loss carryforwards which we do not
expect to realize in future periods. Additionally, our effective income tax rate for the year ended September 28, 2012 was impacted by enacted tax law changes, favorable audit resolutions in
multiple jurisdictions and a non-recurring item generating a tax benefit.

Our
effective income tax rate was 17.5% and a benefit of 6.0% during the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. The increase in our effective
income tax rate was primarily related to the tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business during the first quarter of 2011, a
non-recurring transaction generating a tax benefit in 2010 and a release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2010. The effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable
audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions during 2011. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as
recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,826 million and $1,149 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Specifically, the valuation allowance includes
separation related charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt which further increased a net operating loss carryforward in 2012 which we do not expect to realize in future periods. The
valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be
realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax
liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are
recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.



Equity (Loss) Income in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

Equity (loss) income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 and 2011 reflects our share of Atkore International Group
Inc.'s ("Atkore") net loss which is accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. Equity (loss) income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was nil in 2010.

Segment Results

The following chart reflects our fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 % of net revenue by operating segment.

The
above chart does not include net revenue related to the Company's former Electrical and Metal Products business which was divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and is
included within Corporate & Other. In 2011 and 2010, this represents 3.3% and 12.8%, respectively of net revenue.

Organic
revenue decline for the year ended September 28, 2012 was driven by slow non-residential market growth as well as installation project selectivity in the North
America security business, partially offset by increased service revenue. Organic revenue growth for the year ended September 30, 2011 was driven by increased service revenue coupled with the
impact of several large installation projects. Net revenue for the years ended September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 was impacted by the 53

week of revenue
during fiscal 2011, which is included within Other above.

Operating Income

Operating income for the year ended September 28, 2012 decreased $51 million, or 12.0%, to $374 million, as
compared to operating income of $425 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. Operating income for the year ended September 28, 2012 declined due to restructuring and asset
impairment charges related to organizational realignment. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased $76 million, or 21.8%, to $425 million, as compared to
operating income of $349 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 improved due to favorable revenue mix, increased
project selectivity and productivity enhancements along with the benefit of restructuring savings. Items impacting operating income for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

Additionally,
corporate expense was favorably impacted by cost containment initiatives during the year ended September 28, 2012.

The
net gain on divestiture of $253 million during the year ended September 30, 2011 is primarily related to the divestiture of a majority interest in the Company's former
Electrical and Metal Products business in fiscal 2011. Additionally, corporate expense was favorably impacted by cost containment initiatives during the year ended September 30, 2011.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment in
making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The
following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the
relevant information available at the end of each period.

Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring-Related Assets

—Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its
electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems outside of North America, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively
referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program primarily outside of North America (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets
include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer
acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain
geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using
pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber
system assets and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from
135% to 360% for commercial subscriber pools and dealer intangibles and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method.
The Company uses a straight-line method with a 14-year life for non-pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia) and related
deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination.

Revenue Recognition

—Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction-related
projects are recorded primarily under the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at
completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long-term contracts. Provisions for
anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable.

Sales
of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. We assess our revenue arrangements to
determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting.
Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance
services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price
for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") if available, Third Party Evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or
estimated selling price if neither VSOE or TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price
hierarchy or the non-contingent up-front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon
the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services.



Product
discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Loss Contingencies

—Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the
normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially
determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Asbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables

—We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as
defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and
defense costs based on the Company's historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed. The Company's legal strategy for
resolving claims also impacts these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the look-back period) over which historical claim and
settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time (the look-forward period). As part of the Company's
annual valuation process in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company utilized a look-back period of three years and a look-forward period of fifteen years, except for
claims made against a non-operating subsidiary that the Company is pursuing alternatives for, including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all current and future asbestos
claimants against such subsidiary.

In
connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, we record asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos-related
insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In
determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers.

Annually,
we perform an analysis with the assistance of outside counsel and other experts to update estimated asbestos-related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we
re-evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos-related assets and liabilities.

Income Taxes

—In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and
judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax
and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre-tax operating
income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future
taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more-likely-than-not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the
future may be



reduced
to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction.
Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An
increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

Changes
in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the Company's
deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to
the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the
tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be
less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairments

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and
more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on and considers a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections,
anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available), other market data and the Company's overall market capitalization.

We
elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill
impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on
forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for market participants. A market
approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent
available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered
potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting
unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of
goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value
of goodwill.



We
recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

Fair
value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and
assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to
negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as
follows:

•

A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and
prices) especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets;

•

An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree;

•

Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and

•

Unexpected regulatory changes.

While
historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in
the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material.

Long-Lived Assets

—Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets,
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating
cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for
which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long-lived assets to be
disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the
amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.
Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may be
overstated or understated.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

—Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in
determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect
demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions
resulting in actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive
plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the
present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis
point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $77 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately
$1 million. We consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long-term periods, asset class performance expectations as well
as current and future economic conditions in determining the



expected
long-term return on plan assets. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately
$3 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the
operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world. The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition,
we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to a committed revolving credit facility and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our
operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses, dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we believe our cash position, amounts
available under our credit facility, commercial paper
program and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs in the foreseeable future.

As
of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term debt, and Tyco shareholder's equity are as follows:

Cash flow from operating activities

Cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of
payments for items such as restructuring activities, pension funding, income taxes and other items impact reported cash flow.

The
net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $489 million in 2012. The significant changes in working capital included a $172 million decrease in
income taxes payable, an $80 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $128 million increase in accounts receivable, an $86 million increase in prepaid
expenses and other current assets, and a $72 million increase in inventories.

The
net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $348 million in 2011. The significant changes in working capital included a $216 million decrease in accrued and other
liabilities, a $47 million increase in accounts receivable, a $42 million increase in inventories and a $33 million decrease in accounts payable.



The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $239 million in 2010. The significant changes in working capital included a $268 million
decrease in income taxes payable, a $127 million increase in inventories, partially offset by an $81 million increase in accounts payable and a $63 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other
current assets.

During
2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid approximately $89 million, $90 million and $129 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as held for
sale), respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities.

In
connection with the 2012 Separation, we paid $18 million, nil and nil in separation costs during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

During
the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 we made required contributions of $88 million, $63 million and $67 million,
respectively, to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. We also made voluntary contributions of approximately nil, $12 million and nil to our U.S. plans during the years ended
September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. The Company anticipates that it will contribute at least the minimum required to
its pension plans in 2013 of $11 million for the U.S. plans and $50 million for non-U.S. plans.

Income
taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $147 million, $121 million and $127 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Net
interest paid related to continuing operations were $201 million, $195 million and $234 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Cash flow from investing activities

Cash flows related to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures and acquisitions, and proceeds
derived from divestitures of businesses and assets.

We
made capital expenditures of $406 million, $371 million, and $351 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal
year 2013 is expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2012 and is also expected to exceed depreciation expense.

During
2012, we paid cash for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $217 million, net of cash acquired of $17 million, which primarily related to the
acquisition of Visonic Ltd. within our Global Products segment. During 2011, we paid cash for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $353 million, net of cash acquired
of $3 million, which primarily related to the acquisitions of Signature Security Group within our ROW Installation & Services segment and Chemguard within our Global Products segment.
During 2010, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $48 million, net of cash acquired of nil.

During
2011, we received cash proceeds, net of cash divested of $709 million for divestitures. The cash proceeds primarily related to the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical
and Metal Products business of $713 million. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Cash flow from financing activities

Cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to proceeds received from incurring debt and issuing stock, and cash used to
repay debt, repurchase stock and make dividend payments to shareholders.

During
the fourth quarter of 2012, in connection with the Separation, Tyco and its finance subsidiary, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), redeemed various debt securities
maturing from



to 2023 issued by TIFSA and/or Tyco, in an aggregate principal amount of $2.6 billion. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

On
April 25, 2012, the Company amended its existing Five-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated April 25, 2007 ("the 2007 Credit Agreement"), to extend
the expiration date of the facility from April 25, 2012 to September 30, 2012. Simultaneous with the extension, total commitments under the 2007 Credit Agreement facility were reduced
from an aggregate of $750 million to $654 million. On June 22, 2012, the Company further amended the 2007 Credit Agreement to reduce the lenders' commitments under the 2007 Credit
Agreement from an aggregate of $654 million to $500 million. The 2007 Credit Agreement terminated on September 28, 2012.

Additionally,
on June 22, 2012, TIFSA, as the Borrower, and the Company as the Guarantor, entered into a Five-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, expiring
June 22, 2017, and providing for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $1.0 billion (the "2012 Credit Agreement"). In connection with entering into the 2012 Credit
Agreement, TIFSA and the Company terminated the existing Four-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated March 24, 2011, which provided for revolving credit commitments in the
aggregate amount of $750 million.

During
2012, TIFSA issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for
general corporate purposes. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes
available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $1 billion as of September 28, 2012.

On
January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $250 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net cash proceeds of approximately $494 million. The net
proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million.

On
May 5, 2010, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due 2015, which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net
proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. On May 28, 2010, the Company used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional
cash on hand to redeem all of its 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029, outstanding at that time, which aggregated $878 million in principal amount.

On
October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.125% notes due 2014, which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA
received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount.

Pursuant
to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market,
or pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 28, 2012, we repurchased approximately 11 million
common shares for approximately $500 million under the 2011 share repurchase program. As of September 28, 2012, approximately $200 million of share repurchases remain authorized
under the 2011 share repurchase program. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased approximately 30 million common shares for approximately $1.3 billion under the
2011, 2010 and 2008 share repurchase programs, which completed both the 2010 and 2008 programs. During the year ended September 24, 2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common
shares for approximately $900 million under the 2008 share repurchase program.



On
March 7, 2012, our shareholders approved a cash dividend of $0.50 per common share payable to shareholders in two quarterly installments of $0.25 each on May 23, 2012
and August 22, 2012. Additionally, on September 17, 2012, our shareholders approved another cash dividend of $0.30 per common share payable to shareholders in two quarterly installments
of $0.15 per share to be paid November 15, 2012 and February 20, 2013. The $0.30 dividend reflects the impact of the 2012 Separation on the Company's dividend policy. During fiscal 2012,
2011 and 2010, we paid cash dividends of approximately $461 million, $458 million and $416 million, respectively. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.

Management
believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and operational business needs for the foreseeable future, including capital
expenditures, quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases.

Interest
payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. As of
September 28, 2012 we had settled all outstanding interest rate swaps.

(3)

Purchase
obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services.

(4)

Other
long-term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and
postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these
obligations. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $61 million in 2013 and we do not expect to make any material contributions in 2013
related to postretirement benefit plans.

As
of September 28, 2012, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $121 million and gross interest and penalties of $38 million. We are unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the
current status of our income tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between nil and $30 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months.



As
of September 28, 2012, we had total commitments of $1.0 billion under our revolving credit facility, expiring on June 22, 2017. As of September 28, 2012,
there were no amounts drawn under this revolving credit facility.

TIFSA's
revolving credit facility contains customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and
sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
connection with the 2012 Separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2012 Separation.
Under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, Pentair, Tyco and ADT share (i) certain pre-Distribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco
Flow Control's, Tyco's and ADT's U.S. income tax returns, and (ii) payments required to be made by Tyco with respect to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, excluding approximately
$175 million of pre-2012 Separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 Separation (collectively, "Shared Tax Liabilities"). The Company will be
responsible for the first $500 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Pentair and ADT will share 42% and 58%, respectively, of the next $225 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Pentair, ADT and Tyco will
share 20%, 27.5% and 52.5%, respectively, of Shared Tax Liabilities above $725 million.

In
connection with the 2007 Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2007 Separation.
Under the 2007 Separation and Distribution Agreement and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and TE Connectivity has assumed 31% of certain Tyco
pre-Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which, as of September 28, 2012, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the
spin-offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party.

Backlog

We had a backlog of unfilled orders of $5,101 million and $4,711 million as of September 28, 2012 and
September 30, 2011, respectively. Backlog by segment was as follows ($ in millions):

September 28,

(1)

As
a result of the adjustments made for the China security contracts described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, ROW
Installation & Services backlog decreased by approximately $103 million as of the year ended September 30, 2011.

The
Company's backlog includes recurring revenue-in-force and long-term deferred revenue for upfront fees. Revenue-in-force
represents 12 months' revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security and fire business. The Company's
backlog of $5,101 million and $4,711 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, consists primarily of $2,723 million and
$2,563 million of recurring revenue in force and $395 million



and
$420 million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. NA Installation & Service's backlog of $2,507 million and
$2,373 million, as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, consists primarily of $1,227 million and $1,193 million of recurring revenue in force
and $325 million and $348 million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. ROW Installation & Service's backlog of $2,421 million
and $2,210 million, as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, consists primarily of $1,496 million and $1,370 million of recurring revenue in
force and $70 million and $72 million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively.

Backlog
increased $390 million, or 8.3%, to $5,101 million as of September 28, 2012 as compared to the prior year. The net increase in backlog was primarily related
to an increase in recurring revenue-in-force in our ROW Installation & Services segment, as well as acquisitions within the Global Products businesses. Changes in
foreign currency favorably impacted backlog by $41 million, or 0.9%.

Guarantees

Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted
work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be
triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien, TE Connectivity, ADT and Pentair in accordance with the terms of the 2007 and
2012 Separation and Distribution Agreements and the Tax Sharing Agreements. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the
time of the 2007 and 2012 Separations, we recorded liabilities necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to the 2007 and 2012 Separations we provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to
various Covidien, TE Connectivity, ADT and Tyco Flow Control operating
entities. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the 2007 and 2012 Separations, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. See Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets,
environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax
liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of
management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
of September 28, 2012, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $425 million.

For
a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements.

Non-U.S. GAAP Measure

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by U.S. GAAP, we also disclose
the non-U.S. GAAP measures of organic revenue growth (decline). We believe that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods
presented. When read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP revenue, it enables investors to better evaluate our operations without giving effect to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may
be significant from period to period. In addition, organic revenue growth (decline) is a factor we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This measure is not a
financial measure under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and it may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies. Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and
divestitures and other changes that may not reflect underlying results and trends (for example, the 53

rd

week of operations in fiscal year 2011). Our organic growth (decline)
calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported net revenue associated with acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year, and exclude prior year net revenue
associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year ("adjusted number"). We calculate the rate of organic growth (decline)
based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth (decline) of the combined business, in the case of acquisitions, or the remaining business, in the case of dispositions. We base the
rate of organic growth (decline) for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year upon unadjusted historical net revenue. We may use organic revenue growth (decline) as a
component of our compensation programs.

The
table below details the components of organic revenue growth (decline) and reconciles the non-U.S. GAAP measure to U.S. GAAP net revenue growth (decline).

benefits resulting from Tyco International's Swiss incorporation or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its Swiss incorporation;

•

natural events such as severe weather, fires, floods and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism;



Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions.
These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate
and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial
instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative
financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non-functional currency cash flows are used with the
goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so.

We
do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor
its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having strong investment grade long-term credit ratings from Standard & Poor's and Moody's. These
counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party.

Foreign Currency Exposures

We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to operating entities through the use of forward
foreign currency exchange contracts. Additionally, for our corporate financing entities we manage the foreign currency exposure through a combination of multi-currency notional pool and forward
contracts. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The market risk
related to the forward foreign currency exchange contract is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates.
The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 28, 2012. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would
result in a $7 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a
$9 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying
transactions.

Prior
to the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we hedged net investments in certain foreign operations through the use of foreign currency exchange forward contracts. The objective was to
minimize the exposure to changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated net investment. As of the quarter ended December 30, 2011, we terminated our net investment hedge. Accordingly,
the aggregate notional amount of these hedges was nil and approximately $224 million as of September 28, 2012, and September 30, 2011, respectively.

As
of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, $2.0 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in
nature. For the fiscal years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, we recorded $48 million of cumulative transaction gain and
$2 million and $34 million of cumulative translation losses, respectively, through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans.

Interest Rate Exposures

We manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting



purposes.
Since the third quarter of 2009, TIFSA has been entering into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates
of fixed-rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, TIFSA agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. In connection with the debt tenders and redemption during the quarter ended
September 28, 2012, TIFSA settled all outstanding interest rate swaps. Accordingly, as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the total gross notional amount of our
interest rate swap contracts was nil and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such



information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of September 28, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, these internal controls.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Management's
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012.

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm
that audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, and their report is also included in this Form 10-K.

On March 27, 2012, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with Tyco Flow Control
International Ltd. ("Tyco Flow Control") and The ADT Corporation ("ADT") (the "Original Separation Agreement"), governing, among other things, the separation of Tyco's flow control business
from Tyco and the allocation of assets and liabilities in connection therewith. On September 27, 2012, Tyco, Pentair Ltd. (formerly known as Tyco Flow Control) ("Pentair") and ADT
entered into an Amended and Restated Separation and Distribution Agreement (the "Pentair Separation Agreement") to modify, clarify and supplement certain terms of the Original Separation Agreement,
including certain terms relating to employee benefits matters, insurance claims and



administration,
treatment of equity awards held by certain employees resident outside the U.S. and the treatment of certain costs and expenses in connection with the separation.

Pursuant
to the provisions of the Pentair Separation Agreement, on September 28, 2012, the Company effected a spin-off of Pentair to its shareholders through the pro
rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Pentair to the Company's shareholders in the form of a special dividend out of the Company's contributed surplus (the "Pentair
Distribution").

A
description of the material terms of the Separation Agreement, which reflects the material terms of the Pentair Separation Agreement, is set forth in the section entitled "The
Separation and Distribution Agreements and the Ancillary Agreements—Tyco Flow Control Separation and Distribution Agreement" in Tyco's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on Schedule 14A on August 3, 2012 (the "2012 Separation Proxy Statement") and is incorporated herein by reference.

The
description set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement is only a summary of that agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 2.2 to this Periodic
Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.

ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement

On September 26, 2012, the Company, ADT and certain of their respective subsidiaries entered into a Separation and Distribution
Agreement (the "ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement").

Pursuant
to the provisions of the ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement, (i) the Company engaged in an internal restructuring whereby certain assets related to Tyco's
residential and small business security business in the United States and Canada were transferred to ADT, and ADT assumed from Tyco certain liabilities related to Tyco's residential and small business
security business in the United States and Canada (the "ADT Separation") and (ii) on September 28, 2012, the Company effected a spin-off of ADT to Tyco shareholders through
the pro rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of ADT to Tyco's shareholders in the form of a special dividend out of Tyco's contributed surplus (the "ADT Distribution" and,
together with the Pentair Distribution, the "Distributions" or the "spin-offs").

A
description of the material terms of the ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement is set forth in the section entitled "The Separation and Distribution Agreements and the Ancillary
Agreements—ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement" in Tyco's 2012 Separation Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.

The
description of the ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement set forth in the 2012 Separation Proxy Statement is only a summary of that agreement and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the ADT Separation and Distribution Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.3 to this Periodic Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.

Tax Sharing Agreement

On September 28, 2012, Tyco (together with its subsidiary Tyco International Finance S.A., or TIFSA) entered into a Tax
Sharing Agreement (the "2012 Tax Sharing Agreement") with ADT and Pentair that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Tyco, ADT and Pentair after the
spin-offs with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax matters regarding income taxes, other taxes and related tax returns. See Note 7 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-Income Tax Sharing Agreement

On September 28, 2012, the Company and TIFSA entered into a tax sharing agreement with ADT that governs the respective rights,
responsibilities and obligations of Tyco and ADT after the



Distributions
with respect to tax returns, tax liabilities, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax matters regarding non-income taxes related to specified legal entities (the
"Non-Income Tax Sharing Agreement"). The Non-Income Tax Sharing Agreement provides that Tyco and ADT will share certain non-income tax liabilities that arise for
the period prior to the ADT Distribution from adjustments made by tax authorities to the non-income tax returns of the specified legal entities. Under the Non-Income Tax
Sharing Agreement, Tyco is responsible for amounts equal to accrued liabilities for non-income tax contingencies with respect to the specified entities that will be members of the Tyco
group after the ADT Distribution, and ADT is responsible for amounts equal to accrued liabilities for non-income tax contingencies with respect to the specified entities that will be
members of the ADT group after the ADT Distribution. In each case, payments required to be made in excess of such accrued liabilities are shared by Tyco (40%) and ADT (60%). ADT will have sole
responsibility of any non-income tax liability assessed against the entities acquired in the acquisition of BHS.

ADT
and Tyco agree to indemnify each other against any amounts paid by the other party for which such paying party is not responsible pursuant to the Non-Income Tax Sharing
Agreement. Although valid as between the parties, the Non-Income Tax Sharing Agreement will not be binding on any taxing authority.

The
foregoing is only a summary of the Non-Income Tax Sharing Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Non-Income Tax Sharing Agreement
filed as Exhibit 10.17 to this Periodic Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.

Trademark Agreement

On September 25, 2012, the Company entered into a Trademark Agreement (the "Trademark Agreement") with ADT that will govern each
party's use of certain trademarks, including the ADT trademark and logo (the "ADT Brand"). In addition, Tyco transferred to ADT all of its rights in the ADT Brand in the United States and Canada and
retained rights to the ADT Brand elsewhere in the world. Each of ADT and Tyco agreed that they and their affiliates will not register or use (subject to a "phase out" transitional license to Tyco in
the United States and Canada) the ADT Brand for any goods or services in the other party's territory. The parties are not restricted from competing with each other under other brands. Under the
Trademark Agreement, ADT is the exclusive, worldwide owner of the PULSE trademark.

The
Trademark Agreement allocates the ownership of, and the parties' rights and obligations with respect to, the ADT Brand online. In general, each party has the right to register domain
names containing the ADT Brand in domain names ending in country codes in its respective territory. The Trademark Agreement also contains provisions for allocating ownership, rights and obligations in
other domains and obligations in regard to third-party media (such as social networking sites).

The
Trademark Agreement contains other provisions, including quality control provisions, compliance with applicable laws, and security, system and data protection measures. The Trademark
Agreement took effect as of September 25, 2012, and will remain in effect in perpetuity.

Neither
ADT nor Tyco may assign the Trademark Agreement, or delegate its obligations thereunder, without the consent of the other party, except that a party must assign the agreement in
its entirety in connection with a sale or transfer of such party's entire interest in the ADT Brand, or delegate corresponding obligations in the case of a transfer of less than all of its interest in
the ADT Brand, and in each case the assignee must assume in writing all of the assigning party's obligations under the agreement.

The
foregoing is only a summary of the Trademark Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Trademark Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.18 to this Periodic Report
on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discussion of Management's Responsibility

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
information appearing in this report. We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to being recognized as a leader in governance, controls, clarity and transparency of financial
statements. We are committed to making honesty, integrity and transparency the hallmarks of how we run Tyco. We believe that to succeed in today's environment requires more than just compliance with
laws and regulations—it requires a culture based upon the highest levels of integrity and ethical values. Expected behavior starts with our Board of Directors and our senior management
team leading by example and includes every one of Tyco's global employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and business partners. One of our most crucial objectives is continuing to maintain and
build on the public, employee and shareholder
confidence that has been restored in Tyco. We believe this is being accomplished; first, by issuing financial information and related disclosures that are accurate, complete and transparent so
investors are well informed; second, by supporting a leadership culture based on an ethic of uncompromising integrity and accountability; and third, by recruiting, training and retaining
high-performance individuals who have the highest ethical standards. We take full responsibility for meeting this objective. We maintain appropriate accounting standards and disclosure
controls and devote our full commitment and the necessary resources to these items.

Dedication to Governance, Controls and Financial Reporting

Throughout 2012, we continued to maintain and enhance internal controls over financial reporting, disclosures and corporate governance
practices. We believe that a strong control environment is a dynamic process. Therefore, we intend to continue to devote the necessary resources to maintain and improve our internal controls and
corporate governance.

Our
Audit Committee meets regularly and separately with management, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors, and our internal auditors to discuss financial reports,
controls and auditing.

We,
our Board and our Audit Committee are all committed to excellence in governance, financial reporting and controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 28, 2012 and September 30,
2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2012. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries as of
September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2012, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 28, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 28, 2012, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2012, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2012 of the Company and our report dated November 16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial statement schedule.

TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

—The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a corporation
organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been
prepared in United States dollars ("USD") and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Certain information described under
article 663-663h of the Swiss Code of Obligations has been presented in the Company's Swiss statutory financial statements for the year ended September 28, 2012. Unless
otherwise indicated, references to 2012, 2011 and 2010 are to Tyco's fiscal years ending September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively.

Effective
September 28, 2012, Tyco completed the spin-offs of The ADT Corporation ("ADT") and Pentair Ltd. (formerly known as Tyco Flow Control
International Ltd. ("Tyco Flow Control")), formerly the North American residential security and flow control businesses of Tyco, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the
form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders. Immediately following the spin-off, Pentair, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Tyco Flow Control in a tax-free, all-stock merger (the
"Merger"), with Pentair Ltd. ("Pentair") succeeding Pentair Inc. as an independent publicly traded company. The distribution was made on September 28, 2012, to Tyco shareholders of
record on September 17, 2012. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.50 of a common share of ADT and approximately 0.24 of a common share of Pentair for each Tyco common share held on the record
date. The distribution was structured to be tax-free to Tyco shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The distributions, the
Merger and related transactions are collectively referred to herein as the "2012 Separation". As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tyco's former flow control and North American
residential security businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

After
giving effect to the 2012 Separation, the Company operates and reports financial and operating information in the following three segments: North America Systems
Installation & Services ("NA Installation & Services"), Rest of World Systems Installation & Services ("ROW Installation & Services") and Global Products. The Company also
provides general corporate services to its segments which is reported as a fourth, non-operating segment, Corporate and Other.

Effective
June 29, 2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity, formerly the Healthcare and Electronics businesses of Tyco, respectively, into
separate, publicly traded companies (the "2007 Separation") in the form of a tax-free distribution to Tyco shareholders.

Principles of Consolidation

—Tyco conducts business through its operating subsidiaries. The Company consolidates companies in which it owns or controls
more than fifty percent of the voting shares or has the ability to control through similar rights. Also, the Company consolidates variable interest entities ("VIE") in which the Company has the power
to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant. The VIEs which the Company consolidates,
individually or in the aggregate, did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The
results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The
Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday in September. Fiscal 2012 and 2010 were 52 week years which ended on September 28, 2012
and September 24, 2010, respectively. Fiscal 2011 was a 53-week year which ended on September 30, 2011.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these
Consolidated Financial Statements
include restructuring charges, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss
contingencies (including legal, environmental and asbestos reserves), insurance reserves, net realizable value of inventories, fair values of financial instruments, estimated contract revenue and
related costs, income taxes and tax valuation allowances, and pension and postretirement employee benefit liabilities and expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company recognizes revenue principally on four types of transactions—sales of products, security systems,
monitoring and maintenance services, and contract sales, including the installation of fire and security systems and other construction-related projects.

Revenue
from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass. This is generally when the products reach the
free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Provisions
for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in determining net revenue in the same
period the related sales are recorded. These provisions are based on terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical
experience and trend analysis.

Sales
of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. The Company assesses its revenue
arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate
unit of accounting. Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for
monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy
of estimated selling price for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") if available, Third Party Evidence ("TPE") if
VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE or TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the
estimated selling price hierarchy or the non-contingent up-front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement
with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services. While the Company does not expect situations where VSOE is not available for sales of security systems and
services, if such cases were to arise the Company would follow the selling price hierarchy to allocate arrangement consideration. For transactions in which the Company retains ownership of the
subscriber system asset, fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Non-refundable fees received in



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

connection
with the initiation of a monitoring contract, along with associated direct and incremental selling costs, are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship.

Revenue
from the sale of services is recognized as services are rendered. Customer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are
rendered and the associated deferred revenue is included in current liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

Contract
sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction-related projects are recorded primarily under the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The
extent of progress toward completion is generally measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost at completion. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the
effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Estimated warranty costs are included in total
estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting.

The
Company recorded retainage receivables of $49 million and $52 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, of which
$41 million and $44 million were unbilled, respectively. The retainage provisions consist primarily of fire protection contracts which become due upon contract completion and acceptance.
The Company expects approximately $38 million to be collected during fiscal 2013, which are reflected within accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28,
2012.

Research and Development

—Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of product sales, which amounted to
$145 million, $129 million and $113 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to new product development. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct
costs incurred and building and overhead expenses.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling,
general and administrative expenses, which amounted to $39 million, $46 million and $45 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Acquisition Costs

—Costs incurred to acquire new businesses, new product lines or similar assets are expensed when incurred and are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 5.

Translation of Foreign Currency

—For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that account in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars,
assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in Tyco's shareholders' equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and the impact of foreign currency derivatives related to operating activities are reflected in selling, general and
administrative expenses. Through April 2011, the company declared its dividends in Swiss francs. Any foreign exchange gains or losses arising from such were reflected in other expense, net in the
Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Beginning in May 2011, the Company began making dividend payments out of contributed surplus in U.S. dollars.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to
be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in Tyco's
receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

—Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market value.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

—Property, Plant and Equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense for
2012, 2011 and 2010 was $316 million, $323 million and $354 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when incurred. Except for pooled
subscriber systems, depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

Up to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Subscriber systems

Accelerated method up to 15 years

Other machinery, equipment and furniture and fixtures

Up to 21 years

See
below for discussion of depreciation method and estimated useful lives related to subscriber systems.

Subscriber System Assets and Related Deferred Revenue Accounts

—The Company considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its
electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems outside of North America, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively
referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program, primarily outside of North America (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets
include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets
represent capitalized equipment (e.g. security control panels, touchpad, motion detectors, window sensors, and other equipment) and installation costs associated with electronic security
monitoring arrangements under which the Company retains ownership of the security system assets in a customer's place of business or, outside of North America, residence. Installation costs represent
costs incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use. The Company pays property taxes on the subscriber system assets and upon customer termination, may retrieve such assets. These assets embody a
probable future economic benefit as they generate future monitoring revenue for the Company.

Costs
related to the subscriber system equipment and installation are categorized as property, plant and equipment rather than deferred costs. Deferred costs associated with subscriber
system assets represent direct and incremental selling expenses (i.e. commissions) related to acquiring the customer. Commissions related to up-front consideration paid by customers
in connection with the establishment of the monitoring arrangement are determined based on a percentage of the up-front fees and do not

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

exceed
deferred revenue. Such deferred costs are recorded as non-current assets and are included in the other assets line item within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Subscriber
system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where
the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools
for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the same month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets and related
deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 135% to 360% for
commercial subscriber pools and dealer intangibles and converts to a straight-line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The
Company uses a straight-line method with a 14-year life for non-pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe Latin America and Asia) and related deferred
revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination.

Certain
contracts and related customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under
the ADT dealer program, primarily outside of North America. Acquired contracts and related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price.

During
the first six months (twelve months in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from
customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a
reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset.

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program described above are amortized in pools determined by the same month and year of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over
the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship.

The
estimated useful life of dealer intangibles ranges from 12 to 15 years. The Company amortizes dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis.

Other Amortizable Intangible Assets, Net

—Intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer relationships (dealer accounts discussed
above) and intellectual property.

Other
contracts and related customer relationships, as well as intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks, copyrights and unpatented technology, are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 4 to 40 years. The Company evaluates the amortization methods and remaining useful lives of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether
events and circumstances warrant a revision to the amortization method or remaining useful lives.

Long-Lived Asset Impairments

—The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating
cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and

liabilities
at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment
losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairments

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and
more frequently if triggering events occur (see Note 9). The Company performed its annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on the first day of the fourth
quarter of 2012. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable
transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors which require judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
for impairment.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, the Company first compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined
utilizing a
discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's future budgets discounted using market participants' weighted-average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other
valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further
tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the
carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a
business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit
had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.

Indefinite-lived
intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights are tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method,
respectively.

Investments

—The Company invests in debt and equity securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity securities that represent less
than twenty percent ownership are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within Tyco
shareholders' equity for available for sale securities unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management determines the proper
classification of investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
classifications as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other
equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. Each reporting period, the Company evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that they are
recorded at the



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

lower
of cost or estimated net realizable value. For equity investments in which the Company exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies but does not control, the equity method
of accounting is used. The Company's share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Product Warranty

—The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. Products are warranted against defects in material and
workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Generally, product warranties are implicit in the sale; however, the customer may purchase
an extended warranty. However, in most instances the warranty is either negotiated in the contract or sold as a separate component. The warranty liability is determined based on historical information
such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain instances estimated property damage.

Environmental Costs

—The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Tyco provides for expenses associated with
environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Income Taxes

—Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss
carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, including consideration of tax planning strategies, it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Asbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables

—The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as
defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Annually, during the Company's third quarter, the Company performs an analysis with the assistance of
outside counsel and other experts to update its estimated asbestos-related assets and liabilities. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company re-evaluates the assumptions used to
perform the annual analysis and records an expense as necessary to reflect changes in its estimated liability and related insurance asset. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding
insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the Company's historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims
that may be filed. The Company's legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the
look-back period) over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time
(the look-forward period). As part of the Company's annual valuation process in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company utilized a look-back period of three years and a
look-forward period of fifteen
years, except for claims made against a non-operating subsidiary that the Company is pursuing alternatives for, including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all current and
future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary. See Note 14.

In
connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, the Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The Company's estimate of
asbestos-related



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

insurance
recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future
claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the
insurers.

Insurable Liabilities

—The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these
liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon
historical claims experience. Certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a risk-free rate of return when the pattern and timing of the future obligation is reliably determinable.
The impact of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 was to reduce the obligation by $15 million and $16 million,
respectively. The Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. The Company maintains a captive insurance company to manage certain of its
insurable liabilities. The captive insurance company holds certain investments in an escrow account for the purpose of providing collateral for the Company's insurable liabilities. See Note 13.

Financial Instruments

—The Company may use interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward and option contracts and commodity swaps to manage risks
generally associated with interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity prices. Derivatives used for hedging purposes are designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure
at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract are highly effective at offsetting the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at
inception of the hedge and are expected to remain highly effective over the life of the hedge contract.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet
items related to
operating activities are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to economically hedge
dividends declared in Swiss francs through April of 2011 are reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of other expense, net along with offsetting transaction gains and
losses on the items being hedged. Beginning in May of 2011, the Company no longer declared dividends in Swiss francs. Derivatives used to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates are reported
in interest expense along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are included in the cumulative translation adjustment
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent they are effective. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss
and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. The Company classifies cash flows associated with the settlement of derivatives
consistent with the nature of the transaction being hedged. The ineffective portion of all hedges, if any, is recognized currently in earnings as noted above. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. The Company did not have any cash flow hedges during 2012. In addition, the Company did not have any interest rate swaps,
commodity swaps or net investment hedge outstanding as of September 28, 2012.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

—Noncontrolling interest with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within the Company's
control are considered redeemable noncontrolling



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

interests.
The Company accretes changes in the redemption value through noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest over the period from the date of
issuance to the earliest redemption date. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity on
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of net income or loss or its redemption value.

Reclassifications

—As a result of the 2012 Separation, the operations and assets, liabilities and redeemable noncontrolling interest of the
Company's former flow control and North American residential security businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Furthermore, beginning in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2012, the Company realigned its management and segment reporting structure, and accordingly, prior period segment amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. See
Note 19.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded its proportionate share of the net loss of Atkore International Group Inc. ("Atkore") within equity (loss) income in
earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. In previous periods, the Company reflected its proportionate share of Atkore's net loss within other
expense, net in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations as such amounts were not material. The Company's equity loss of $26 million, $12 million and nil for fiscal 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively, have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance which
expanded and enhanced the existing disclosure requirements related to multi-employer pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The amendments require additional quantitative and qualitative
disclosures to provide more detailed information regarding these plans including: the significant multi-employer plans in which the Company participates, the level of the Company's participation and
contributions with respect to such plans, the financial health of such plans and an indication of funded status. These disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with a better
understanding of the employer's involvement in multi-employer benefit plans. The disclosure provisions of the guidance were adopted concurrent with the pension disclosures associated with the
Company's annual valuation process during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company concluded its participation in any individual multi-employer plan was not significant.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income. The
guidance amended the reporting of Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI") by eliminating the option to present OCI as part of the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity. The amendment will not
impact the accounting for OCI, but only its presentation in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The guidance requires that items of net income and OCI be presented either in a single
continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements which include total net income and its components, consecutively followed by total OCI and its components to
arrive at total comprehensive income. In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to defer the effective date for those aspects of the guidance relating to the presentation of
reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. The guidance must be applied retrospectively and is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which amends the process of testing goodwill for impairment. Additionally, in July 2012, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
which similarly amends the process of testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as having a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit or
indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, performing the traditional two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. If an entity concludes otherwise, it would be required to perform the
first step of the two step goodwill impairment test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill
impairment test. If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then the entity is not required to
take further action. If an entity concludes otherwise, it would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the asset and comparing it with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity shall recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess. However, an entity has the option to
bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative assessment. The guidance is effective for Tyco for interim and annual impairment testing beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2013.

2. 2012 Separation Transaction

As discussed in Note 1, the Company completed the spin-offs of ADT and Tyco Flow Control, formerly the North American residential security and flow control businesses
of Tyco, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders.

During
fiscal 2012, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $839 million in connection with activities taken to complete and effectuate the 2012 Separation and
to create the revised organizational structure of the Company ("Separation Charges"). The Company has presented $561 million and $278 million of pre-tax charges within income
from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations, respectively. The amounts presented within discontinued operations are costs directly related to the 2012 Separation that are
not expected to provide a future benefit to the Company. The components of the Separation Charges incurred within continuing operations and discontinued operations consisted of the following ($ in

3. Divestitures

The Company has continued to assess the strategic fit of its various businesses and has pursued the divestiture of certain businesses which do not align with its long-term
strategy.

Fiscal

On
September 28, 2012, Tyco completed the 2012 Separation and has presented its former North American residential security and flow control
businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

The
Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the 2012 Separation. In limited instances, final
determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods, such as in the case of working capital and the cash adjustments specified in the separation and distribution agreements entered among
the parties, and when final income tax returns are filed in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, ADT and/or Tyco Flow Control legal entities. These adjustments are
not expected to be material and will be recorded through Tyco shareholder's equity in subsequent periods when finally determined.

Additionally,
the year ended September 28, 2012 included $21 million of income tax expense associated with pre-2007 Separation tax liabilities, which was
recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended September 28, 2012, the Company was reimbursed
$8 million pursuant to a tax sharing agreement (the "2007 Tax Sharing Agreement") entered into in conjunction with the 2007 Separation, which has been recorded in income from
discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 7.

Fiscal

On
November 9, 2010, the Company announced that it entered into an investment agreement (the "Agreement") to sell a majority interest in its Electrical
and Metal Products business to an affiliate of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R"). The Company formed a newly



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

incorporated
holding company, Atkore, to hold the Company's Electrical and Metal Products business. On December 22, 2010, the transaction closed and CD&R acquired shares of a newly-created
class of cumulative convertible preferred stock of Atkore (the "Preferred Stock"). The Preferred Stock initially represented 51% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis)
of Atkore. In connection with the closing, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $713 million and recorded a gain of $259 million, which included $33 million of
cumulative translation gain, during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company recorded net working capital adjustments of $11 million that
reduced the gain on disposal. The gain on disposal is recorded within restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges (gains), net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, CD&R is entitled to a quarterly dividend which is payable in cash or in shares of Preferred Stock, at the discretion of
Atkore. Since the closing of the transaction, Atkore has elected to pay CD&R's quarterly dividend in shares of Preferred Stock, which has diluted the Company's ownership in Atkore. As of
September 28, 2012, the Company's ownership percentage was approximately 45%. Tyco's retained ownership interest in Atkore is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is recorded
in other assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 such interest was $92 million and $118 million, respectively.
The Company's proportionate share of Atkore's net loss is recorded within equity (loss) income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The
Company recorded equity losses of $26 million, $12 million and nil for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively.

Fiscal

During
the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company approved a plan to sell its French security business, which was part of the Company's ROW Installation &
Services segment.
The results of operations were presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations had not been met. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company completed the sale and
recorded a $53 million pre-tax gain within restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges (gains), net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other Matters

The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the
2007 Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. There were nil, $13 million and nil of adjustments recorded through Tyco
shareholders' equity during the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. Adjustments in the future for the impact of filing final
income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and/or TE Connectivity legal entities and for certain amended income tax returns for the periods
prior to the 2007 Separation may be recorded to either Tyco shareholders' equity or the Consolidated Statement of Operations depending on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment.

Divestiture Charges (Gains), Net

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded a net loss of $14 million, and net gains of $224 million and
$39 million, respectively, in restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges (gains), net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the divestiture and
write-down to fair value less cost to sell of certain businesses that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. The net gain for the year ended September 30, 2011
includes a gain of $248 million, net of working capital adjustments, recognized in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in the Company's Electrical and Metal Products business, as
discussed above. The net gain for the year ended September 24, 2010 includes the $53 million gain recognized upon the sale of the Company's French security business, as discussed above.

4. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges, Net

During fiscal 2012, the Company identified and pursued opportunities for cost savings through restructuring activities and workforce reductions to improve operating efficiencies across
the Company's businesses. The Company expects to incur restructuring and restructuring related charges of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2013.

2009 and prior actions

The Company continues to maintain restructuring reserves related to actions initiated prior to fiscal 2011. The total amount of these
reserves were $48 million and $69 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. The Company incurred $6 million, $10 million and $103 million of restructuring
charges for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, related to 2009 and prior actions. The aggregate remaining reserves
primarily relate to facility exit costs for long-term non-cancelable lease obligations primarily within the Company's ROW Installation & Services segment.

Acquisitions

During the year ended September 28, 2012, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $217 million, net
of cash acquired of $17 million, the most significant of which related to the acquisition of Visonic Ltd. ("Visonic") on December 6, 2011. Visonic is a global developer and manufacturer
of electronic security systems and components. Cash paid for Visonic totaled approximately $94 million, net of cash acquired of $5 million by the Company's Global Products segment. The balance of the
acquisitions for the year ended September 28, 2012, were included within the Company's NA and ROW Installation & Services and Global Products segments, none of which were material
individually or in the aggregate.

5. Acquisitions (Continued)

The
Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest of $12 million related to an acquisition in the second quarter of 2012. Net loss and adjustments related to changes in the
redemption value were immaterial during the year ended September 28, 2012. The Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest balance was $12 million and nil as of September 28, 2012 and
September 30, 2011, respectively.

During
the year ended September 30, 2011, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $353 million, net of cash acquired of $3 million, which primarily
related to the acquisitions of Oceania Capital Partners Limited's Signature Security Group ("Signature Security") and Chemguard Inc. ("Chemguard"). Signature Security is focused on providing
electronic security to the small business and residential markets in Australia and New Zealand and was acquired on April 29, 2011. Cash paid for Signature Security totaled approximately $184
million, net of cash acquired of $2 million by the Company's ROW Installation & Services segment. On September 1, 2011, the Company's Global Products segment completed the acquisition of
Chemguard for approximately $130 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Chemguard is a provider of firefighting foam concentrates and equipment, foam systems, services and specialty
chemicals.

During
the year ended September 24, 2010, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $48 million, net of cash acquired of nil. The Company's former
Electrical and Metal Products segment acquired certain assets of a business for $39 million, while the Company's ROW Installation & Services segment acquired a business for $9 million.

On
May 14, 2010, the Company's former North American residential security segment acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS" or
"Broadview Security"), a publicly traded company that was formerly owned by The Brink's Company, in a
cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $2.0 billion. Net cash paid for Broadview Security included in discontinued operations totaled $448 million, net of
cash acquired of $137 million. Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of BHS common stock was converted into the right to receive: (1) $13.15 in cash and 0.7562 Tyco
common shares, for those shareholders who made an all-cash election, (2) 1.0951 Tyco common shares, for those shareholders who made an all stock election or (3) $12.75 in
cash and 0.7666 Tyco common shares, for those shareholders who made a mixed cash/stock election or who failed to make an election. Tyco issued approximately 35 million shares resulting in stock
consideration of approximately $1,362 million.

Acquisition and Integration Related Costs

Acquisition and integration costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011
and September 24, 2010, the Company incurred acquisition and integration costs of $9 million, $5 million and nil, respectively. Such costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,826 million and $1,149 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Specifically, the valuation allowance as of
September 28, 2012 includes separation related charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt which further increased a net operating loss carryforward which the Company does not
expect to realize in future periods. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all or a
portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred
tax assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As
of September 28, 2012, the Company had $6,874 million of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Of these, $6,462 million
have no expiration, and the remaining $412 million will expire in future years through 2030. In the U.S., there were approximately $727
million of federal and $470 million of state net operating loss carryforwards as of September 28, 2012, which will expire in future years through 2030.

$107 million and $125 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income
tax expense. The Company accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $38 million and $37 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30,
2011, respectively. The Company recognized $3 million, $2 million and $12 million of income tax expense for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the
years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively.

Tax Sharing Agreements and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the 2012 and 2007 Separations, the Company entered into the 2012 and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements,
respectively, that govern the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the Company, Pentair and ADT after the 2012 Separation and the Company, Covidien and TE



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Connectivity
after the 2007 Separation with respect to taxes. Specifically this includes ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the
distribution of all of the shares of Pentair, ADT, Covidien or TE Connectivity to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of
Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code ("the Code") or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment
under the Code.

Under
the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement Tyco, Pentair and ADT share (i) certain pre-Distribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax
authorities to ADT's U.S., Tyco Flow Control's and Tyco's income tax returns, and (ii) payments required to be made by Tyco with respect to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, excluding
approximately $175 million of pre-2012 Separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 Separation (collectively, "Shared Tax Liabilities"). Tyco will be
responsible for the first $500 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Pentair and ADT will share 42% and 58%, respectively, of the next $225 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Tyco, Pentair
and ADT will share 52.5% 20% and 27.5%, respectively, of Shared Tax Liabilities above $725 million. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will
generally be shared 20%, 27.5%, and 52.5% by Pentair, ADT and Tyco, respectively. As of September 28, 2012, Tyco established liabilities representing the fair market value of its obligations
under the 2012 Tax Sharing Arrangement which is recorded in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet with an offset to Tyco shareholders' equity.

Under
the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco shares responsibility for certain of its, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's income tax liabilities, which result in cash payments, based on a
sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities
that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. The costs and expenses associated with the
management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. In connection with the execution of the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco established a net receivable from
Covidien and TE Connectivity representing the amount Tyco expected to receive for pre-2007 Separation uncertain tax positions, including amounts owed to the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"). Tyco also established liabilities representing the fair market value of its share of Covidien's and TE Connectivity's estimated obligations, primarily to the IRS, for their
pre-2007 Separation taxes covered by the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. During the year ended September 28, 2012, Tyco made a net cash payment of $11 million to Covidien
and TE Connectivity related to the resolution of certain IRS audit and pre-Separation tax matters.

Tyco
assesses the shared tax liabilities and related guaranteed liabilities related to both the 2012 and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements at each reporting period. Tyco will provide payment
to Pentair and ADT under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement and to Covidien and TE Connectivity under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is
expected to occur as
the audit process by applicable taxing authorities is completed for the impacted years and cash payments are made. Due to the nature of the unresolved adjustments described in the next paragraph, the
maximum amount of potential future payments under the 2012 and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements is not determinable. Such cash payments, when they occur, will reduce the guarantor liability as such
payments represent an equivalent reduction of risk. Tyco also assesses the sufficiency of the 2012 and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements guarantee liabilities on a quarterly basis and will increase the
liability

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

when
it is probable that cash payments expected to be made under the 2012 or 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements exceed the recorded balance.

Tyco
and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised
issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 Separation. The issues and proposed adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the
sharing provisions of the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement and Tyco's liabilities under the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement are further subject to the sharing provisions in the 2012 Tax Sharing
Agreement. Tyco is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. With respect to adjustments raised by the IRS, although Tyco has resolved a substantial number of these
adjustments, a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that Tyco will be able to
resolve all the open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, Tyco expects to litigate
these matters once it receives the requisite statutory notices from the IRS, which is expected to occur during fiscal 2013. The Company has assessed its obligations under the 2007 Tax Sharing
Agreement, including with respect to the proposed civil fraud penalties discussed below, to determine that its recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by the Company under
such agreement. In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, the Company determined the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present
value measurement techniques. Significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes, assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome
and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution. The probability weighted outcomes were discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters
is uncertain and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

In
connection with the aforementioned audits, the IRS has assessed a civil fraud penalty of $21 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 against a prior subsidiary that was
distributed to TE Connectivity in connection with the 2007 Separation. The penalties arise from actions of former executives taken in connection with intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex
Technologies in 1998 and 1999. This is a pre-2007 Separation tax liability that is covered by the provisions of the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement.

In
addition to dealing with tax liabilities for periods prior to the respective Separations, the 2012 and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements contain sharing provisions to address the
contingencies that the 2012 or 2007 Separations, or internal transactions related thereto, may be deemed taxable by U.S. or non U.S. taxing authorities. In the event the
2012 Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the 2012 Separations by Tyco, ADT or Pentair, the party responsible for such
failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on each company as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken by Tyco, ADT or Pentair after the
2012 Separation, then Tyco, ADT and Pentair would be responsible for any taxes imposed on any of the companies as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions
as described above. Similar provisions exist in the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement. If either of the 2007 or 2012 Separation, or internal transactions taken in anticipation thereof, were
deemed taxable, the associated liability could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the 2012 and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements sharing
formulas. In addition, Pentair

and
ADT, and Covidien and TE Connectivity are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the 2012 or 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements' sharing formula, respectively.

Each
of the 2012 and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements provides that, if any party to such agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the
distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party to the agreement would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party
to the agreement, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the 2012 or 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to
default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, Tyco could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly,
under certain circumstances, Tyco may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share of its tax liabilities under either of the 2012 or 2007 Tax Sharing Agreements.

9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Annually, in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with
its carrying amount. In connection with the 2012 Separation, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reorganized into a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of
these organizational changes, the Company assessed its new reporting units and conducted valuations to determine the assignment of goodwill to the new reporting units based on their estimated relative
fair values. Following the relative fair value goodwill allocation, the Company then tested goodwill for impairment.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)

Fair
value for each reporting unit is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's forecast cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital of
market participants. A market approach is utilized to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
goodwill is considered potentially impaired. In determining fair value, management relies on and considers a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections,
anticipated future cash flow, comparable market transactions (to the extent available), other market data and the Company's overall market capitalization. There were no goodwill impairments as a
result of performing the Company's 2012, 2011 and 2010 annual impairment tests.

$62 million for 2016 and $166 million for 2017 and thereafter.

10. Related Party Transactions

The Company has amounts due related to loans and advances issued to employees in prior years under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, relocation programs and other advances made to
executives. Loans were provided to employees under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, which is now discontinued, except for outstanding loans for the payment of taxes upon the vesting of shares
granted under our Restricted Share Ownership Plans. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors and new senior management at that time adopted a policy under which no new loans are
allowed to be granted to any officers of the Company and existing loans are not allowed to be extended or modified. There have been no loans made to any of the Company's current executives. The
outstanding loans are not collateralized and bear interest, payable annually, at a rate based on the six-month LIBOR, calculated annually as the average of the rates in effect on the first day of each
of the preceding 12 months. Loans are generally repayable in ten years; however, earlier payments are required under certain circumstances, such as when an employee is terminated. In addition,
the Company made mortgage loans to certain employees under employee relocation programs. These loans are generally payable in 15 years and are collateralized by the underlying property. The
maximum amount outstanding under these programs was $21 million as of both September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011. Loans receivable under these programs, as well as other
unsecured advances outstanding, were $21 million as of both September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011. The total

outstanding
loans receivable includes loans to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Company's former chairman and chief executive officer (until June 2002). The amount outstanding under these loans, plus accrued
interest, was $28 million as of both September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 and the rate of interest charged on such loans was 0.7% and 0.5% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Interest
income on these interest bearing loans was not material for all periods presented. Certain of the above loans totaling $1 million as of both September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 are
non-interest bearing.

The
Company filed civil complaints against Mr. Kozlowski, its former chief financial officer, Mark Swartz, and Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director for breach of
fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. See Note 14.

During
2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as
officers. Purchases from these companies during each year aggregated less than 1 percent of consolidated net revenue.

In
conjunction with the debt redemptions, the Company terminated associated interest rate swap contracts related to the 6.0% Notes due 2013 and 4.125% Notes due 2014. As a result of the
debt redemptions, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $453 million which was recorded within other expense, net in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended September 28, 2012. The charge was comprised of the premium paid in the tender offers, write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to the
extinguished notes, and a net gain recognized upon termination of the associated interest rate swap contracts.

Fiscal 2011 Debt Issuance/Repayment

On January 12, 2011, TIFSA issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Notes due on January 15, 2018 (the
"2018 Notes") and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Notes due on January 15, 2023 (the "2023 Notes"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA
received total net proceeds of approximately $494 million after deducting debt issuance costs of approximately $1 million for the 2018 Notes and $2 million for the 2023 Notes, as well as debt discount
of approximately $1 million for the 2018 Notes and $2 million for the 2023 Notes. The net proceeds of the aforementioned debt issuances, along with other available funds, were used to fund the
repayment upon maturity of all of the Company's outstanding 6.75% Notes due February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million. The 2018 Notes and the 2023 Notes are unsecured and rank equally with
TIFSA's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the "2015 Notes"). TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs of approximately $3 million and a
debt discount of approximately $2 million. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding 6.375% Notes due October 2011. The 2015 Notes are
unsecured and rank equally with TIFSA's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. TIFSA may redeem any of the 2015 Notes at any time by paying
the greater of the principal amount of the notes or a "make-whole" amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 2015 Notes have the right to require TIFSA to repurchase all

Commercial Paper

From time to time, TIFSA may issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes. The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured
commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $1 billion as of September 28, 2012. As of September 28, 2012
and September 30, 2011, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding.

Credit Facilities

On April 25, 2012, the Company amended its existing Five-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated April 25, 2007
("the 2007 Credit Agreement"), to extend the expiration date of the facility from April 25, 2012 to September 30, 2012. Simultaneous with the extension, total commitments under the 2007
Credit Agreement facility were reduced from an aggregate of $750 million to $654 million. On June 22, 2012, the Company further amended the 2007 Credit Agreement to reduce the lenders'
commitments under the 2007 Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $654 million to $500 million. The 2007 Credit Agreement terminated on September 28, 2012.

Additionally,
on June 22, 2012, TIFSA, as the Borrower, and the Company as the Guarantor, entered into a Five-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, expiring
June 22, 2017, and providing for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $1.0 billion (the "2012 Credit Agreement"). In connection with entering into the 2012 Credit
Agreement, TIFSA and the Company terminated the existing Four-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated March 24, 2011, which provided for revolving credit commitments in the
aggregate amount of $750 million.

As
of September 28, 2012, the Company's committed revolving credit facility totaled $1.0 billion. This revolving credit facility may be used for working capital, capital
expenditures and general corporate purposes. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, there were no amounts drawn under the Company's revolving credit facilities. Interest under
the revolving credit facilities is variable and is calculated by reference to LIBOR or an alternate base rate.

Other Debt Information

The aggregate amounts of principal public debt maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows: nil in 2013, nil in
2014, nil in 2015, $258 million in 2016, nil in 2017 and $1,178 million thereafter.

The
weighted-average interest rate on total debt was 6.5% and 5.9% as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, excluding the impact of interest rate
swaps. There was no public short-term debt outstanding as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the
Company had swapped an aggregate of approximately nil and $1.2 billion, respectively, of fixed for floating rate debt. The impact of the Company's interest rate swap agreements on reported
interest expense was a net decrease of $18 million, $22 million and $24 million for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. As of
September 28, 2012, the Company had terminated all interest rate swaps.

12. Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of
these



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

12. Guarantees (Continued)

guarantees
vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and
performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien, TE Connectivity, ADT and Pentair in accordance with the terms of the 2007 and 2012 Separation and
Distribution Agreements and Tax Sharing Agreements. These guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreements. See Note 7.

In
addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to various Covidien, TE Connectivity, ADT and Tyco Flow Control operating entities.
In connection with both the 2012 and 2007 Separations, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien, TE Connectivity, ADT or Pentair, as
appropriate. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the Separation dates, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. The Company's obligations related to the 2012
Separation were $3 million, which was included in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2012 with an offset to Tyco shareholders' equity on the
Separation date. The Company's obligations related to
the 2007 Separation were $3 million and $4 million, which were included in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2012 and
September 30, 2011, respectively, with an offset to Tyco shareholders' equity on the Separation date.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
of September 28, 2012, the Company had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $425 million.

13. Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt and derivative financial instruments. The
fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated book value as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011. The fair value of derivative
financial instruments was not material to any of the periods presented. See below for the fair value of investments and Note 11 for the fair value of debt.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, Tyco is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company's objective for utilizing derivative financial
instruments is to manage these risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualified as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, the Company documented and linked the relationships between the hedging
instruments and hedged items. The Company also assessed and documented at the hedge's inception whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions were effective in offsetting changes in fair values
associated with the hedged items. These hedges did not result in any hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments recognized
currently in the Company's
Statement of Operations, with the exception of net investment hedges for which changes in fair value are reported in the cumulative translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss to the
extent the hedges are effective. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The derivative financial instruments and impact of such
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments was not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 or Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010.

Foreign Currency Exposures

The Company manages foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of
forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact
and potential variability in cash flows associated with intercompany loans, accounts receivable, accounts payable and forecasted transactions that are denominated in certain foreign currencies. As of
September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the total gross notional amount of the Company's foreign exchange contracts was $225 million and $766 million, respectively.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Financial Instruments (Continued)

Effective
March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Tyco made the final dividend payment in the form of a reduction of capital in
February 2011, denominated in Swiss francs (See Note 16). The Company paid dividends in U.S. dollars, based on the exchange rate in effect shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations in the
value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend was approved and paid increased or decreased the U.S. dollar amount required to be paid. The Company managed the
potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk. Beginning in May 2011, the
Company makes dividend payments out of contributed surplus in U.S. dollars which has eliminated the need to use currency hedges for dividend payments.

Prior
to the quarter ended December 30, 2011, the Company hedged net investments in certain foreign operations through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. The objective
was to minimize the exposure to changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated net investment. As of the quarter ended December 30, 2011, the Company terminated its net investment
hedge. Accordingly, the aggregate notional amount of these hedges was nil and $224 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. Changes in the fair value of
forward contracts qualifying as net
investment hedges are reported in cumulative translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent the hedges are effective. The ineffective portion of the hedge was not material
to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. These contracts did not have a material impact to the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2011.

Interest Rate Exposures

The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as
principal counterparties, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. Since the third quarter of 2009, TIFSA has been entering into interest rate swap transactions with the
objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixed-rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, TIFSA agrees with financial institutions acting as
principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. In connection with the
debt tenders and redemption during the quarter ended September 28, 2012, TIFSA settled all outstanding interest rate swaps. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the
total gross notional amount of the Company's interest rate swap contracts was nil and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Counterparty Credit Risk

The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, the
Company is exposed to losses if the derivative is in an asset position. When the fair value of a derivative instrument is an asset, the counterparty has to pay the Company to settle the contract. This
exposes the Company to credit risk. However, when the fair value of a derivative instrument is a liability, the Company has to pay the counterparty to settle the contract and therefore there is no
counterparty credit risk. Tyco has established policies and procedures to limit the potential for counterparty credit risk, including establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing
the creditworthiness of counterparties. As a matter of practice, the Company deals with major banks worldwide having strong investment grade long-term credit ratings from Standard &
Poor's and



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Financial Instruments (Continued)

Moody's.
To further reduce the risk of loss, the Company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with substantially all of its counterparties. Master
netting agreements provide protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and, in some cases, enable receivables and payables with the same counterparty to be offset on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, providing for a more meaningful balance sheet presentation of credit exposure. The Company's derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require
collateral or other security to be furnished by the Company or the counterparties.

The
Company's exposure to credit risk associated with its derivative instruments is measured on an individual counterparty basis, as well as by groups of counterparties that share
similar attributes. As of September 28, 2012, the Company was exposed to industry concentration with financial institutions as well as risk of loss if an individual counterparty or issuer
failed to perform its obligations under contractual terms. The maximum amount of loss that the Company would incur as of September 28, 2012 without giving consideration to the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements was approximately $1 million.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of
information used in developing fair value estimates. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. In cases where two or
more levels of inputs are used to determine fair value, a financial instrument's level is determined based on the lowest level input that is considered significant to the fair value measurement in its
entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are summarized as follows:

•

Level 1—inputs are based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities which are accessible as of the measurement date.

•

Level 2—inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations for the asset or liability that are derived principally from or corroborated by
market data for which the primary inputs are observable, including forward interest rates, yield curves, credit risk and exchange rates.

•

Level 3—inputs for the valuations are unobservable and are based on management's estimates of
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques such as option pricing models and discounted
cash flow models.

Investments

Investments primarily include cash equivalents, U.S. government obligations, U.S. government agency securities and corporate debt
securities.

When
available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities. Such investments are included in Level 1. When quoted market prices are
not readily available, pricing determinations are made based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information
and

Derivative Financial Instruments

As described above, under the caption "Derivative Instruments" derivative assets and liabilities consist principally of forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The fair values for these derivative financial instruments are derived from market approach pricing models that take into account the contractual
terms and features of each instrument, forward foreign currency rates for the Company's foreign exchange contracts and yield curves for the Company's interest rate swaps existing at the end of the
period. Valuations are adjusted to reflect creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and the creditworthiness of the Company for liabilities. Such adjustments are based on observable market
evidence and are categorized as Level 2 exposures. Derivative financial instruments are not presented as the derivative financial instruments were not material to any of the periods presented.

The Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services. As of September 28, 2012, such obligations were as follows:
$241 million in 2013, $9 million in 2014 and $3 million in 2015.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Legacy Matters Related to Former Management

The Company is a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management, including its former chief executive officer,
Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, its former chief financial officer, Mr. Mark Swartz and a former director, Mr. Frank Walsh Jr. The Company has filed civil complaints against
Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to alleged abuses of the Company's Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program,
unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self dealing transactions and other improper conduct. In connection with Tyco's affirmative actions against Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz,
Mr. Kozlowski, through counterclaims, and Mr. Swartz, through a separate lawsuit, are seeking an aggregate of approximately $140 million allegedly due in connection with their
compensation and retention arrangements and under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). Mr. Walsh is seeking indemnification for legal and other expenses incurred by him in
connection with the Company's affirmative action against him for breaches of fiduciary duties.

With
respect to Mr. Kozlowski, on December 1, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of several of the Company's affirmative
claims against him before trial, while dismissing all of Mr. Kozlowski's counterclaims for pay and benefits after 1995. Prior to the commencement of trial scheduled for August 2012, the parties
reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter, with Mr. Kozlowski agreeing to release the Company from any claims to monetary amounts related to compensation, retention or other
arrangements alleged to have existed between him and the Company. Although the parties have reached an agreement in principle, until the settlement agreement is signed, the Company will continue to
maintain the amounts recorded in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, which reflect a net liability of approximately $91 million, for the amounts allegedly due under his compensation and retention
arrangements and under ERISA.

With
respect to Mr. Swartz, on March 3, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the Company's motion for summary judgment as to
liability for its affirmative actions and further ruled that issues related to damages would need to be resolved at trial. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reversed a
$50 million liability related to Mr. Swartz's pay and benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations. On May 15, 2012, Mr. Swartz filed a lawsuit against Tyco in New York state court claiming entitlement to monies under ERISA. The Company removed
the case to the U.S. district court for the Southern District of New York and filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Swartz's claims for multiple reasons, including that the statute of limitations had
expired, at the latest, during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. A trial to determine the Company's damages from Mr. Swartz's breaches of fiduciary duty concluded on October 17, 2012.
At the conclusion of the trial, the Court ruled that the Company was entitled to recover all monies earned by Mr. Swartz in connection with his employment by Tyco between September 1,
1995 and

June 1,
2002. The Company filed a motion requesting the entry of monetary sum certain judgment in conformity with the Court's ruling regarding the time period of disgorgement. In connection
with Mr. Swartz's affirmative claims against the Company, the Court dismissed all of Mr. Swartz's claims except one claim in which Mr. Swartz contends he is entitled to
reimbursement from the Company for taxes he paid in connection with his 2002 Separation Agreement. The Court has not opined on the merits of this claim, and the Company intends to continue to
vigorously defend this claim.

With
respect to Mr. Walsh, in June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against him for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related wrongful
conduct involving a $20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The payment
was purportedly made for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging the Company's acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh pleaded guilty to a felony
violation of New York law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York County) and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Both the felony charge and the civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such
payment. The felony charge accused Mr. Walsh of intentionally concealing information concerning the payment from Tyco's directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities
in the State of New York. The SEC action alleged that Mr. Walsh knew that the registration statement covering the sale of Tyco securities as part of the CIT Group acquisition contained a
material misrepresentation concerning fees payable in connection with the acquisition. Pursuant to the plea and settlement, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on
December 17, 2002. In October 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the Company's affirmative claims for recovery of damages against Mr. Walsh. In
January 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's ruling that Tyco's Board of Directors could ratify breaches of fiduciary duties owed by
Mr. Walsh to Tyco's shareholders, and remanded the case to the District Court to resolve certain issues relating to consequential damages. On June 20, 2012, the District Court ruled in
Tyco's favor and entered a judgment against Mr. Walsh. Separately, Mr. Walsh is pursuing a New York state court claim against the Company asserting his entitlement to indemnification.
Any judgment against the Company related to this matter would be shared with Covidien and TE Connectivity under the agreements governing the 2007 Separation.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative
cleanup methods. As of September 28, 2012, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately
$48 million to $60 million. As of September 28, 2012, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $50 million, of which $43 million is
included in accrued and other current liabilities and $7 million is included in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and
reserves for environmental matters, the Company believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Asbestos Matters

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits
based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial
products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third-parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate
defendants. While the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large
percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a result, have been dismissed by the courts. The Company's historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at
having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, the Company cannot predict the extent
to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future. In addition, the Company continues to assess its strategy for resolving asbestos claims. Due to the number of claims and limited
amount of assets at one of the Company's non-operating subsidiaries, the Company is pursuing alternatives for this subsidiary, including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all
current and future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary. While the company has not finalized its approach, if the Company is ultimately successful with this alternative, it will likely assign
rights to certain insurance assets and make a cash payment in order to fully resolve the claims against the subsidiary.

As
of September 28, 2012, the Company has determined that there were approximately 4,900 claims pending against it, its subsidiaries or entities for which the Company has assumed
responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. This amount reflects the Company's current estimate of the number of viable claims made against such entities, and includes adjustments
for claims that are not actively being prosecuted, identify incorrect defendants, are duplicative of other actions or for which the Company is indemnified.

Annually,
during the Company's third quarter, the Company performs an analysis with the assistance of outside counsel and other experts to update its estimated asbestos-related assets
and liabilities. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company re-evaluates the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and records an expense as necessary to reflect changes in
its estimated liability and related insurance asset. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the
Company's historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed. The Company's legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts
these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the look-back period) over which historical claim and settlement experience is used
to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time (the look-forward period). As part of the Company's annual valuation process in
the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company determined that a look-back period of three years was more appropriate than a five year period because the Company has experienced a higher
and more consistent level of claims activity and settlement costs in the past three years. As a result, the Company believes a three year look-back period is more representative of future
claim and settlement activity than the five year period it previously used. The Company also revised its look-forward period from seven years to fifteen years. The Company's decision to
revise its look- forward period was primarily based on improvements in the consistency of observable data and the



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Company's
more extensive experience with asbestos claims since the look-forward period was originally established in 2005. The revisions to the Company's look-forward and
look-back periods do not apply to claims made against the subsidiary described above for which the Company is pursuing alternatives, including a negotiated settlement with representatives
of all current and future asbestos claimants. Excluding these claims, the Company believes it can make a more reliable estimate of pending and future claims beyond seven years. The Company believes
valuation of pending claims and future claims to be filed over the next fifteen years produces a reasonable estimate of its asbestos liability, which it records in the consolidated financial
statements on an undiscounted basis.

The
Company's estimate of asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements
relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers a number of factors, including available insurance,
allocation methodologies, and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reached an agreement with one of its primary insurance carriers for
asbestos related claims. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed with the insurance carrier to accept a lump sum cash payment of $97 million in respect of certain policies, and
has reached a coverage-in-place agreement with the insurance carrier with respect to certain claims. The cash payments will be received by the Company in three equal
installments no later than the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The first payment was received during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In connection with the settlement, the Company
also expects to terminate a cost-sharing agreement that it had entered into with an entity that it had acquired a
business from several decades ago and as a result, has access to all of the insurance policies and is responsible for all liabilities arising from asbestos claims made against the subsidiary that was
acquired. The agreement will be terminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 upon receipt of the last of the three payments.

As
a result of the activity described above, the Company recorded a net charge of $108 million during the quarter ended June 29, 2012. As of September 28, 2012, the
Company's estimated net liability of $155 million was recorded within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of
$401 million, and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of $246 million. The Company believes that its asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets as of
September 28, 2012 are appropriate. Similarly, as of September 30, 2011, the Company's estimated net liability of $84 million was recorded within the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of $299 million, and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of $215 million.

The
amounts recorded by the Company for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on the Company's strategies for resolving its asbestos claims, currently
available information, and a number of estimates and assumptions. Key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year, the average cost of resolution of
claims, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers, amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the Company's insurance carriers. Furthermore, predictions with respect to
these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect the Company's liability and cash payments for asbestos-related matters
include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance
policies among subsidiaries. As a result, actual

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

liabilities
or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the Company's calculations vary significantly from actual results.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, the Company has received and responded to various allegations and other
information that certain improper payments were made by the Company's subsidiaries and agents in recent years. On September 24, 2012, the Company settled the charges related to these alleged
improper payments with the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC and agreed to pay approximately $26 million in fines, disgorgement and
prejudgment interest to the DOJ and SEC, which the Company had previously reserved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company expects to make the payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In
connection with the settlement, the Company entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, and a subsidiary of the Company (which is no longer a subsidiary as a result of the 2012
Separation) pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). Pursuant to the non-prosecution agreement, the Company has acknowledged that a
number of its subsidiaries made payments, both directly and indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain and retain business with private and state-owned entities, and falsely or
inaccurately described the payments in the subsidiaries' books, records and accounts. The non-prosecution agreement also acknowledges the Company's timely, voluntary and complete
disclosure to the DOJ, and its cooperation with the DOJ's investigation—including a global internal investigation concerning bribery and related misconduct—and extensive
remediation. Under the non-prosecution agreement, the Company has also agreed to cooperate with and report periodically to the DOJ concerning its compliance efforts, and to continue to
implement an enhanced compliance program and internal controls designed to prevent and detect FCPA violations. Notwithstanding the settlement of the DOJ and SEC investigations, the Company may be
subject to allegations of FCPA violations in the future as well as commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with the Company as a result of its entry into the
non-prosecution agreement or otherwise as a result of these compliance matters. If so, or if it is unable to comply with the provisions of the non-prosecution agreement, it may
be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the DOJ or SEC. In such a case, the Company could be subject to material fines, injunctions on future conduct, the imposition of a compliance
monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Covidien
and TE Connectivity agreed, in connection with the 2007 Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its responses regarding these matters, and agreed that liabilities
primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics businesses of the Company would be assigned to Covidien and TE Connectivity, respectively. As a result, Covidien and TE Connectivity have
agreed to contribute approximately $5 million and immaterial amounts, respectively, toward the aforementioned $26 million.

ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic
Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund (the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the Fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

plan
such as the Fund, the employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute
between Grinnell Fire Protection Systems, SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669. Following an adverse arbitration ruling in the third quarter of fiscal
2012, the Company agreed to settle this matter and recorded a charge in the amount of $28.5 million, including accrued interest on the liability which was recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. ERISA requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt
of a liability assessment from the plan, and as a result the Company had made $22.0 million of payments through June 29, 2012. The Company made the remaining $6.5 million of cash
payments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

Tax Litigation

Tyco and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with these
examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 Separation. The issues and proposed
adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with Covidien and TE Connectivity (the "2007 Tax Sharing Agreement") under
which Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE
Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. The costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the
parties. Tyco is reviewing and contesting certain tax adjustments proposed by tax authorities. With respect to adjustments raised by the IRS, although the Company has resolved a substantial number of
these adjustments, a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that Tyco will be able to
resolve all the open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, Tyco expects to litigate
these matters once it receives the requisite statutory notices from the IRS, which is expected to occur during fiscal 2013. The Company has assessed its obligations under the 2007 Tax Sharing
Agreement and determined that its recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by the Company under such agreement. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is
uncertain and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods. See Note 7
for additional information related to income tax matters.

Other Matters

In addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and product
and general liability claims, incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. With respect to many of these claims, the Company either self-insures or maintains
insurance through third-parties, with varying deductibles. While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of any such
proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows beyond
amounts recorded for such matters.

15. Retirement Plans

The Company sponsors a number of pension plans. The Company measures its pension plans as of its fiscal year end. The following disclosures exclude the impact of plans which are
immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its
U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net
periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a
systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on local regulations and the advice of professionally qualified
actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

The
net periodic benefit cost for material U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans for 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows ($ in millions):

During
fiscal 2011, the Company froze its last remaining active U.S. pension plan. During fiscal 2010, the Company adopted plan amendments that froze pension plan benefits for certain of
its defined benefit arrangements in the United Kingdom, which resulted in the Company recognizing a curtailment gain of approximately $19 million in selling, general and administrative expenses
within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For inactive plans the Company amortizes its actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy of the pension plan participants.

The
estimated net loss and prior service cost for material U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over
the next fiscal year are expected to be $14 million and nil, respectively.

The
estimated net loss and prior service credit for material non-U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic
benefit cost over the next fiscal year are expected to be $12 million and nil, respectively.

Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to maintain an adequate level of diversification
while maximizing the return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants as well as providing adequate liquidity to
meet

immediate
and future benefit payment requirements. In addition, local regulations and local financial considerations are factors in determining the appropriate investment strategy in each country. For
U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40% allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S. pension
plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 48% to equity securities, 48% to debt securities and 4% to other asset classes.

Although
the Company does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management in certain commingled funds, the
plans may
indirectly hold Tyco securities. The aggregate amount of the securities would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.

The
Company evaluates its defined benefit plans' asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of risk. Types of investment concentration risks that are evaluated
include, but are not limited to, concentrations in a single entity, industry, foreign country and individual fund manager. As of September 28, 2012, there were no significant concentrations of
risk in the Company's defined benefit plan assets.

The
Company's plan assets are accounted for at fair value and are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value of assets and their placement within the fair
value hierarchy levels. The Company's asset allocations by level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 28,

Equity
securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. equities. Publicly traded securities are valued at the last trade or closing price reported in the
active market in which the individual securities are traded. Certain equity securities are held within commingled funds which are valued at the unitized net asset value ("NAV") or percentage of the
net asset value as determined by the custodian of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund.

Fixed
income securities consist primarily of government and government agency securities, corporate debt securities, and mortgage and other asset-backed securities. When available, fixed
income securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Government and government agency securities and corporate debt securities
are valued using the most recent bid prices or occasionally the mean of the latest bid and ask prices when markets are less liquid. Asset-backed securities including mortgage backed securities are
valued using broker/dealer quotes when available. When quotes are not available, fair value is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, which incorporates other observable inputs such as
cash flows, underlying security structure and market information including interest rates and bid evaluations of comparable securities.

Certain
fixed income securities are held within commingled funds which are valued unitizing NAV determined by the custodian of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net
assets owned by the fund.

Cash
and cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term commercial paper, bonds and other cash or cash-like instruments including settlement proceeds due from
brokers, stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

The
strategy of the Company's investment managers with regard to the investments valued using NAV or its equivalent is to either match or exceed relevant benchmarks associated with the
respective asset category. None of the investments valued using NAV or its equivalent contain any redemption restrictions or unfunded commitments.

During
2012, the Company contributed $36 million to its U.S. and $52 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, which represented the Company's minimum required
contributions to its pension plans for fiscal year 2012. The Company did not make any voluntary contributions to its U.S. and non-U.S. plans during 2012.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that it will contribute at least the minimum required to its pension plans in 2013 of $11 million for the U.S.
plans and $50 million for non-U.S. plans.

The
Company also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit plans on behalf of certain employees. Pension expense related to multi-employer plans was not material for
2012, 2011 and 2010.

Executive Retirement Arrangements

—Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz participated in individual Executive Retirement Arrangements maintained by Tyco
(the "ERA"). Under the ERA, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz would have fixed lifetime benefits commencing at their normal retirement age of 65. The Company's accrued benefit obligations for
Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 28, 2012 were $93 million and nil, respectively. The Company's accrued benefit obligations for
Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 30, 2011 were $93 million and $48 million, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reversed the
liability related to Mr. Swartz's pay and benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Retirement benefits are available at earlier ages and alternative forms of benefits can be elected. Any such variations would be actuarially equivalent to the
fixed lifetime benefit starting at age 65. Amounts owed to Mr. Kozlowski under the ERA are the subject of litigation brought by the Company against him. See Note 14.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

—The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include 401(k) matching programs, as
well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was
$58 million, $54 million and $57 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company also maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). This plan
is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to IRS limits on eligible compensation under the defined contribution plans. The expense related to the SERP was not
material for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their
compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds
correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation liabilities were $103 million
and $87 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. Deferred compensation expense was not material for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

—The Company generally does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions for its employees. However, certain
acquired operations provide these benefits to employees who were eligible at the date of acquisition, and a small number of U.S. and Canadian operations provide ongoing eligibility for such benefits.

Net
periodic postretirement benefit cost was not material for 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include unfunded postretirement benefit obligations of
$40 million and $38 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively within other liabilities. The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include nil of
postretirement benefit assets as of both September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011. In addition, the Company recorded a net actuarial gain of $4 million and $8 million
within accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively.

The
Company expects to make contributions to its postretirement benefit plans of $4 million in 2013.

2018-2022


16. Shareholders' Equity

Dividends

Prior to May 2011, the Company paid dividends in the form of a return of share capital from the Company's registered share capital.
These payments were made free of Swiss withholding taxes. The Company now makes dividend payments from its contributed surplus equity position in its Swiss statutory accounts. These payments are also
made free of Swiss withholding taxes. Unlike payments made in the form of a reduction to registered share capital, which are required to be denominated in Swiss francs and converted to U.S. dollars at
the time of payment, payments from the contributed surplus account may effectively be denominated in U.S. dollars.

Under
Swiss law, the authority to declare dividends is vested in the general meeting of shareholders, and on March 7, 2012, the Company's shareholders approved a cash dividend of
$0.50 per share, payable to shareholders in two quarterly installments of $0.25 on May 23, 2012 and August 22, 2012. On September 17, 2012, the Company's shareholders approved a
cash dividend of $0.30 per share, payable to shareholders in two quarterly installments of $0.15 on November 15, 2012 and February 20, 2013. The $0.30 dividend reflects the impact of the
2012 Separation on the Company's dividend policy. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of $231 million as of March 7, 2012 and an additional accrued dividend of
$139 million as of September 17, 2012 within accrued and other current liabilities and a corresponding reduction to contributed surplus. The first installment of $0.25 was paid on
May 23, 2012 to shareholders on record on April 27, 2012. The second installment of $0.25 was paid on August 22, 2012 to shareholders on record on July 27, 2012.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

16. Shareholders' Equity (Continued)

On
March 9, 2011, the Company's shareholders approved an annual dividend on the Company's common shares of $1.00 per share, which was paid from contributed surplus in four
installments of $0.25 per share to shareholders on record on April 29, 2011, July 29, 2011, October 28, 2011 and January 27, 2012. As a result, the Company recorded an
accrued dividend of $468 million as of March 9, 2011 within accrued and other current liabilities and a corresponding reduction to contributed surplus.

On
March 10, 2010, the Company's shareholders approved an annual dividend on the Company's common shares of 0.90 Swiss Francs ("CHF") per share, which was paid in the form of a
return on capital in four installments of CHF 0.22, CHF 0.22, CHF 0.23 and CHF 0.23 to shareholders on record on May 14, 2010, July 30, 2010,
October 29, 2010 and January 28, 2011, respectively. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 428 million as of March 10, 2010, which
approximated $399 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. The accrued dividend was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of March 26, 2010 and as a corresponding reduction of common shares, which reduced the par value of the Company's
common shares from CHF 7.60 to CHF 6.70. The installments were paid in U.S. dollars converted from Swiss Francs at the USD/CHF exchange rate in effect shortly before the payment dates.

On
May 14, 2010, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of BHS. BHS shareholders who received Tyco common stock as consideration in the merger were included in the
first installment of dividend payments that were paid on May 26, 2010. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 32 million as of May 14, 2010, which was
approximately $28 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date.

Common Stock

As of September 28, 2012, the Company's share capital amounted to CHF 3,258,632,435, or 486,363,050 registered common
shares with a par value of CHF 6.70 per share. Until March 9, 2013, the Board of Directors may increase the Company's share capital by a maximum amount of CHF 1,628,100,000 by
issuing a maximum of 243,000,000 shares. In addition, (i) the share capital of the Company may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 321,127,717 through the issue of a maximum of
47,929,510 shares through the exercise of conversion and/or option or warrant rights granted in connection with bonds, notes or similar instruments and (ii) the share capital of the Company may
be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 321,127,717 through the issue of a maximum of 47,929,510 shares to employees and other persons providing services to the Company. Although the
Company states its par value in Swiss francs, it continues to use the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency for preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Share Repurchase Program

The Company's Board of Directors approved the $1.0 billion 2011 share repurchase program, the $1.0 billion 2010 share
repurchase program and the $1.0 billion 2008 share repurchase program, in April 2011, September 2010 and July 2008, respectively. Share repurchases reduce the amount of common shares

17. Share Plans

Tyco share-based compensation cost recognized during 2012 was $140 million, which included $81 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, $27 million
related to discontinued operations, $28 million in separation costs and $4 million in restructuring charges. Total share-based compensation during 2011 was $110 million, which
included $89 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $21 million related to discontinued operations. Total share-based compensation during 2010 was
$120 million, which included $99 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $21 million related to discontinued operations. The Company has recognized a related
tax benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements during 2012, 2011 and 2010 of $43 million, $31 million and $35 million, of which $8 million,
$6 million, and $6 million is included in discontinued operations, respectively.

On
July 12, 2012, in connection with the 2012 Separation, the Board of Directors approved the conversion of all outstanding performance share units of the Company into
restricted stock units based on performance achieved through June 29, 2012. Each performance share unit converted into a number of restricted stock units at a ratio determined by the
Compensation Committee on August 2, 2012 based on its review and certification of performance results through June 29, 2012. Upon vesting of the resulting restricted stock units, each
award will be settled in stock. All awards maintained their original vesting terms. The modifications made to the market-based condition of outstanding performance share units as a result of the 2012
Separation also constituted a modification similar to the modification described above. As a result, the modification resulted in incremental compensation cost of $8 million, of which
$7 million was recorded in separation costs and $1 million in discontinued operations for the year ended September 28, 2012. In addition, incremental expense was recognized in the
quarter related to the performance achieved through June 29, 2012. Such expense totaled $7 million, of which $6 million was recorded in separation costs and $1 million in
discontinued operations for the year ended September 28, 2012.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17. Share Plans (Continued)

In connection with the 2012 Separation, most employees' outstanding stock option awards were converted into options to acquire the stock of the employee's
post-separation employer in a manner designed to preserve the intrinsic value of such awards. However, for certain corporate employees and for all terminated employees, all or a portion of
such employees' stock option awards were converted into options to acquire the stock of each of the Company, Pentair and ADT. The modifications made to the share options as a result of the
2012 Separation constituted a modification under the authoritative guidance for accounting for stock compensation, which requires a comparison
of fair values of the stock option awards immediately before the 2012 Separation and the fair values immediately after the 2012 Separation. In certain instances, the fair value
immediately after the 2012 Separation was higher. As a result, the modification resulted in incremental compensation cost of $1 million, the majority of which was recorded in
discontinued operations for the year ended September 28, 2012. Except for the changes described, the material terms of the stock option awards remained unchanged from the original grant.

Also
in connection with the 2012 Separation, restricted stock units held by Tyco employees and deferred stock units held by Tyco directors were converted, in some cases, into
restricted stock units in the Company, Pentair and ADT, and in other cases, solely into restricted stock units of the employee's post-separation employer. All such modifications were
designed in a manner to preserve the intrinsic value of such awards. Except for the changes described, the material terms of the restricted stock units and deferred stock units remained unchanged from
the original grant.

During
2004, the 2004 Plan effectively replaced the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended as of May 12, 1999 (the "LTIP I Plan") and the Tyco
International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan") for all awards effective on and after March 25, 2004. The 2004 Plan provided for the award of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long term performance awards, restricted units, restricted shares, deferred stock units, promissory stock and other stock-based awards (collectively,
"Awards").

The
2004 Plan provided for a maximum of 40 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan. In addition, any common
shares that have been approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the LTIP Plans but which have not been awarded there under as of January 1, 2004, reduced by the number of common
shares related to Awards made under the LTIP Plans between January 1, 2004 and March 25, 2004, the date the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, (or which have been awarded but will
not be issued, owing to expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004) and which are no longer available
for any reason (including the termination of the LTIP Plans) will also be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. When common shares are issued pursuant to a grant of a full value award, the total
number of common shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per share issued. As of September 28, 2012, there were approximately 10 million shares
available for grant under the 2004 Plan. As of October 1, 2012, the 2012 Plan replaced the 2004 Plan and no further awards are permitted to be granted under the 2004 Plan.

The
LTIP I Plan reserved common shares for issuance to Tyco's directors, executives and managers as share options. During 2012, there were approximately 0.1 million shares originally
reserved for issuance under this plan, that became available for future grant under the 2004 Plan due to expiration,

forfeiture
or cancellation. As of September 28, 2012, an immaterial number of options remained outstanding which were granted under the LTIP I prior to its termination.

The
LTIP II Plan was a broad-based option plan for non-officer employees. The terms and conditions of this plan were similar to the LTIP I Plan. During 2012, there were approximately 0.1
million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan that became available for future grant under the 2004 Plan due to expiration, forfeiture or cancellation. As of September 28,
2012, 0.2 million options remained outstanding which were granted under the LTIP II prior to its termination.

On
September 17, 2012, shareholders approved the Tyco International 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan") which replaces the 2004 Plan. Pursuant to the plan, effective
October 1, 2012, 50 million common shares are available for equity-based awards, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the 2012 Plan. No additional shares are available under
the 2004 Plan. In addition, any common shares which have been awarded under the 2004 Tyco International Ltd. Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") but which are not issued, owing to expiration,
forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004 and which are no longer available for any reason will also be
available for issuance under the 2012 Plan. When common shares are issued pursuant to a grant of a full value award (for example, restricted stock units and performance share units), the total number
of common shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by 3.32 shares.

Share Options

—Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices that are equal to or greater than the closing market price of the common shares
on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four years and will
generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Historically, the Company's practice has been to settle stock option exercises through either newly issued shares or from shares held in
treasury.

The
grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected
volatility is calculated based on an analysis of historic and implied volatility measures for a set of peer companies. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and
expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life
assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual
share option forfeitures. The
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

—Under the U.K. Save As You Earn Plan ("SAYE Plan"), eligible employees in the United Kingdom were granted options to
purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options under the SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six
months after the date of vesting. The SAYE Plan provided for a maximum of 10 million common shares to be issued. All of the shares
purchased under the SAYE Plan were purchased on the open market. The SAYE Plan was approved on November 3, 1999 for a ten year period and expired according to its terms on November 3,
2009. The International Benefits Oversight Committee has not approved any additional grants since the last annual grant on October 9, 2008 and it has not applied for approval of a replacement
for the SAYE Plan at this time.

The
grant-date-fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions for expected volatility, the average
expected life, the risk-free rate, as well as the expected annual dividend per share were made using the same methodology as previously described under

Share
Options

.

There
were no options granted under the SAYE Plan during 2012, 2011 and 2010. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $1.0 million, $0.4 million and
$1.0 million, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was not material. As of September 28, 2012, there were no
shares outstanding and no unrecognized compensation cost related to the SAYE Plan.

Restricted Share Awards

—Restricted share awards, including restricted stock units and performance share units are granted subject to certain
restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Restrictions on the award generally lapse upon normal retirement, if more than twelve months from the grant date, death or
disability of the employee.

The
fair market value of restricted awards, both time vesting and those subject to specific performance criteria, are expensed over the period of vesting. Restricted stock units, which
vest based solely upon passage of time generally vest over a period of four years. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's shares on
the grant date. Performance share units, which are restricted share awards that vest dependent upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels generally vest in
their entirety three years from the grant date. The fair value of performance share units is determined based on the Monte Carlo
valuation model. The compensation expense recognized for all restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.

Recipients
of restricted stock units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalent units ("DEUs"). Recipients of performance share units have no voting rights and may receive
DEUs depending on the terms of the grant.

to restricted stock units; the outstanding shares at that time have been moved to the restricted stock units reporting table. The granted activity reflects the incremental performance share units
earned based upon performance achieved through June 29, 2012.

Deferred Stock Units

—Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco common shares with distribution deferred
until termination of employment or service to the Company. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares on a one-for-one basis.
Similar to restricted stock units that vest over time, the fair value of DSUs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over
the vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote and do not receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to receive dividend equivalent units. Conditions of vesting are
determined at the time of grant. Under the 2004 Plan, grants made to executives generally vested in equal annual installments over three years while DSUs granted to the Board of Directors were
immediately vested. The Company has granted 1.1 million DSUs, all of which are fully vested. The delivery of approximately 1.0 million DSUs will occur six months following September 28, 2012.

There
were no DSU awards granted during 2012, 2011 and 2010, however participants continue to earn DEUs on their existing awards. The total fair value of DSUs including DEUs vested
during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $1 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively.

19. Consolidated Segment Data

Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, make investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.

In
connection with the 2012 Separation, the Company has realigned its management and segment reporting structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company
operates and reports financial and operating information in the following three segments:

•

NA Installation & Services

designs, sells, installs, services and
monitors electronic security systems and fire detection and suppression systems for commercial, industrial, retail, institutional and governmental customers in North America.

•

ROW Installation & Services

designs, sells, installs, services and
monitors electronic security systems and fire detection and suppression systems for commercial, industrial, retail, residential, small business, institutional and governmental customers in the Rest of
World ("ROW") regions.

•

Global Products

and life safety products, including intrusion security, anti-theft devices, breathing apparatus and access control and video management systems, for commercial, industrial, retail,
residential, small business, institutional and governmental customers worldwide, including products installed and serviced by our NA and ROW Installation & Services segments.

The
Company also provides general corporate services to its segments which will be reported as a fourth, non-operating segment, Corporate and Other. For the years ended
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, Corporate and Other includes the Company's former Electrical and Metal Products business which was divested in the first quarter of fiscal
2011.

As
a result of the 2012 Separation, net revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010 have been recast for

23. Tyco International Finance S.A.

TIFSA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has public debt securities outstanding which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco. See Note 11. The following tables
present condensed consolidating financial information for Tyco, TIFSA and all other subsidiaries. Condensed financial information for Tyco and TIFSA on a stand-alone basis is presented using the
equity method of accounting for subsidiaries.

As
a result of the 2012 Separation, the Company undertook certain steps during fiscal 2012 to restructure the ownership of subsidiaries within Tyco. Specifically, the Company
completed the transfer of certain investments from TIFSA to Tyco. Since the transactions were entirely among wholly-owned subsidiaries of Tyco, there was no impact on the Company's financial position,
results of operations and
cash flows. The transactions did, however, result in a decrease to TIFSA's investment in subsidiaries. Since these transactions were among entities under common control, their effects have been
reflected as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, which resulted in a net decrease to TIFSA's investment in subsidiaries of $117 million as of September 30, 2011.

TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

24. Immaterial Corrections

During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company determined that certain aged receivables in its ROW Installation & Services segment related to security contracts in China may not
be collectible. After a formal investigation, the Company determined that certain records relating to those receivables were falsified by district level employees located in one region of China. The
Company has concluded that the revenue recognition practices related to the aged receivables, which dated back to fiscal 2008, were inappropriate. The Company has evaluated and concluded that the
identified amounts were not material to any of its previously issued annual and interim financial statements, including the effects of
presenting ADT and Tyco Flow Control as discontinued operations. Although management has determined the amounts individually and in the aggregate are not material to prior periods, in accordance with
authoritative accounting literature on considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year, the financial statements included herein have been adjusted
to correct for the impact of these items.

The
Company has revised its previously issued annual and interim (See Supplementary Financial Information—Quarterly Financial Data) financial statements as well as the other
subsidiaries column in the Company's guarantor financial statements (See Note 23) and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K to reflect certain immaterial adjustments, primarily related to revenue recognition and cost of goods sold. As a result of these adjustments, basic and diluted earnings
per share attributable to Tyco common shareholders' decreased by $0.03 for fiscal 2011. There was no impact to basic or diluted earnings per share attributable to Tyco common shareholders' for fiscal
2010. The following tables set forth the impact of the corrections on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24,
2010 and Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2011. Certain of the immaterial adjustments relate to periods prior to fiscal 2010. Consequently, the cumulative effect of those
adjustments, $15 million, has been reflected as a decrease in accumulated earnings as of September 25, 2009 on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity. The
adjustments had no effect on the Company's cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities' subtotals within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
