September 25, 2009, respectively. The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday in September. Fiscal 2011 is a 53-week year. Fiscal years 2010
and 2009 were both 52-week years.

History and Development

Tyco International Ltd.

Tyco International Ltd. is a Company organized under the laws of Switzerland. The Company was created as a result of the July
1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited, a public company organized under the laws of Bermuda, at which time ADT Limited changed its name to
Tyco International Ltd. Effective March 17, 2009, following shareholder and Board of Director approval on March 12, 2009, the Company ceased to exist as a Bermuda corporation and



continued
its existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile").

Effective
June 29, 2007, Tyco International Ltd. completed the spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity, formerly our Healthcare and Electronics
businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies (the "2007 Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders.

On
May 14, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS" or "Broadview Security") in a
cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $2.0 billion. Broadview Security has been integrated into our Tyco Security Solutions segment. See Note 5 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On
December 22, 2010, we sold a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On
September 19, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies consisting of the
Company's North American residential security business, its flow control business and its commercial fire and security business (the "2012 Separation"). The 2012 Separation is expected to be completed
by the end
of the third calendar quarter of 2012 through a tax-free pro rata distribution of all of the equity interests in the flow control and North American residential security businesses.

Completion
of the 2012 Separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors and shareholders, receipt of tax opinions and rulings and the
filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Separation will also be subject to the completion of any necessary financing. See
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Tyco's
registered and principal office is located at Freier Platz 10, CH-8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Its management office in the United States is located at 9 Roszel
Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.

Segments

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we realigned our Safety Products segment between our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments to create two new segments: Tyco Security
Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. Tyco Security Solutions consists of the former ADT Worldwide segment as well as the portion of the former Safety Products segment that manufactures security
products including intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection consists of the former Fire Protection Services segment as well as a number of businesses from
the former Safety Products segment including the fire suppression and life safety products business. In addition, various businesses were realigned between Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire
Protection. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
discussed above, we sold a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business which contributed $0.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion of
revenue in the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively.

On
September 30, 2010, we sold our water business in Europe, which was part of our Tyco Flow Control Segment. The business met the held for sale criteria and discontinued
operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Tyco Security Solutions

Our Tyco Security Solutions segment designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems for residential,
commercial, educational, governmental and industrial customers around the world primarily operating under the ADT brand name. In addition, Tyco Security Solutions designs, manufactures and sells
security products including intrusion, access control and video management systems and is one of the world's largest providers of electronic security systems and services. Tyco Security Solutions has
a significant market presence in North and South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. With 2011 net revenue of $8.6 billion, our Tyco Security Solutions segment comprises
49% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2010 and 2009, net revenue totaled $7.7 billion, or 45%, of our consolidated net revenue and $7.4 billion, or 44%, of our consolidated net
revenue, respectively.

On
May 14, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Broadview Security in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately
$2.0 billion, with $585 million in cash being used to fund the acquisition. Broadview Security's core business was to provide security alarm monitoring services for residential and
commercial properties in North America, and it has been integrated into our Tyco Security Solutions segment. In connection with the integration, the Broadview Security brand has been discontinued. See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Services and Products

Tyco Security Solutions supplies and installs electronic security systems to the residential, commercial, educational, governmental and
industrial markets. It also provides electronic security services, including monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety conditions as well as maintenance of electronic security
systems.

Our
electronic security systems business involves the installation and use of security systems designed to detect intrusion, control access and react to movement, fire, smoke, flooding,
environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These electronic security systems include detection devices that are usually connected to a monitoring center that receives and
records alarm signals where skilled
security monitoring specialists verify alarm conditions and initiate a range of response scenarios. For most systems, control panels identify the nature of the alarm and the areas where a sensor was
triggered. Our other solutions include: access control systems for sensitive areas such as government facilities and banks; video surveillance systems designed to deter theft and fraud and help
protect employees and customers; and asset protection and security management systems designed to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary electronic data. Our offerings also include
anti-theft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry. Many of the world's leading retailers use our

Sensormatic

anti-theft systems to
help protect against shoplifting and employee theft.

Purchasers
of our intrusion systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. Systems installed at
customers' premises may be either owned by Tyco Security Solutions or by our customers. Monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local fire or police
departments, notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action. In certain markets, Tyco Security Solutions directly provides the alarm response services with highly trained and professionally
equipped employees. In some instances, alarm systems are connected directly to local fire or police departments.

Recently,
Tyco Security Solutions launched Pulse Interactive Solutions ("Pulse") for residential and small business customers. Pulse includes home automation features in addition to
interactive remote security capability for customers. Depending on the plan that is purchased, customers can remotely access information regarding the security of their home or business, arm and
disarm their security system, adjust lighting or thermostat levels, or view real-time video from cameras covering different



areas
of their premises, all via secure access from web-enabled devices. Pulse also allows customers to create customized schedules for turning lights, thermostats and appliances on or
off, and can be programmed to perform certain functions, such as recording video and sending text messages, based on triggering events.

Many
of our residential customers may purchase security systems as a result of prompting by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system
is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition of coverage.

Tyco
Security Solutions also designs and manufactures electronic security products, including integrated video surveillance and access control systems to enable businesses to manage
their security and enhance business performance. Its global access control solutions include: integrated security management systems for enterprise applications, access control solutions applications,
alarm management panels, door controllers, readers, keypads and cards. Its global video system solutions include: digital video management systems, matrix switchers and controllers, digital
multiplexers, programmable cameras, monitors and liquid crystal displays. Its intrusion security products provide advanced security products for homes and businesses ranging from burglar alarms to a
full range of security systems including
alarm control panels, keypads, sensors and central station receiving equipment used in security monitoring centers.

Customers

Tyco Security Solutions sells to residential, commercial, educational, governmental and industrial customers. Our residential customers
typically include owners of single-family homes or renters in multi-family apartment complexes. Our commercial customers include, among others, retail businesses, financial institutions,
commercial/industrial facilities and health care facilities. Our government customers include federal, state and local governments, defense installations, schools and universities and mass
transportation providers. In addition to advertising, direct mailings and the internet, we market our electronic security systems and services to these customers through a direct sales force and, with
respect to certain residential customers, through an authorized dealer network. A separate sales force services large commercial and governmental customers and focuses on key vertical markets such as
retail and banking.

Competition

The electronic security services business is highly competitive and fragmented with a number of major firms and thousands of smaller
regional and local companies. Competition is based primarily on price in relation to quality of service. Rather than compete purely on price, we emphasize the quality of our electronic security
service, the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of our customers' security needs. For large commercial, educational, governmental and industrial customers the comprehensive national and/or
global coverage offered by Tyco Security Solutions can also provide a competitive advantage. We also have significantly expanded our systems integration capabilities, which allow Tyco Security
Solutions to offer comprehensive solutions to commercial customers that fully integrate security and fire offerings into comprehensive IT networks, business operations and management tools, and
process automation and control systems.

Competition
for the manufacture and sale of our security products is based on specialized product capacity, breadth of product line, price, training and support and delivery. The
principal competitors are specialty products manufacturing companies based in the United States, with other smaller competitors in Europe and Asia.



Tyco Fire Protection

Our Tyco Fire Protection segment designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems and
building and life safety products for commercial enterprises, governmental entities, airports, commercial shipping companies, transportation systems, healthcare facility operators, petrochemical
facilities and homeowners. We believe we are one of the largest providers of these systems and services. With 2011 net revenue of $4.8 billion, our Tyco Fire Protection segment comprises 28% of
our consolidated net revenue. In 2010 and 2009, net revenue totaled $4.5 billion, or 27%, of our consolidated net revenue and $4.6 billion, or 27%, of our consolidated net revenue,
respectively.

Services and Products

Tyco Fire Protection designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services fire alarm and fire detection systems, automatic fire
sprinkler systems and special hazard suppression systems. Tyco Fire Protection operates under various leading trade names, including

SimplexGrinnell, Wormald, Dong Bang,
Zettler, Ansul, Grinnell, Total Walther

and

Tyco.

Tyco
Fire Protection offers a wide range of fire alarm and fire detection systems. These alarm and detection systems include fire alarm control panels, advanced fire alarm monitoring
systems, smoke, heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems. Tyco Fire Protection also offers a wide range of water-based sprinkler systems. In addition, Tyco Fire Protection
provides custom designed special hazard suppression systems, which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases. These systems are often especially suited to
fire suppression in certain manufacturing, power generation, petrochemical, offshore oil exploration, transportation, data processing, telecommunications, commercial food preparation, mining and
marine applications.

Tyco
Fire Protection installs fire detection and fire suppression systems in both new and existing buildings. These systems typically are purchased by owners, construction engineers and
electrical contractors as well as mechanical or general contractors. In recent years, retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire
detection and fire suppression systems, especially in hotels, healthcare facilities and educational establishments. In
September 2008, the International Residential Code Council, a non-profit association that develops model codes that are the predominant building and fire safety regulations used by state
and local jurisdictions in the United States, adopted a proposal advanced by firefighters and other life-safety advocates to require sprinkler systems in new one and two family dwellings
effective in January 2011. This national code is not binding on state and local jurisdictions and must be adopted locally before it becomes mandatory for new homes being built in these areas. The
timing of adoption, if at all, will vary by jurisdiction. Tyco Fire Protection also continues to focus on system maintenance and inspection and other services, which have become increasingly
significant parts of its business.

Tyco
Fire Protection also manufactures life safety products, including self-contained breathing apparatus designed for firefighter, industrial and military use, supplied air
respirators, air-purifying respirators, thermal imaging cameras, gas detection equipment and gas masks. Tyco Fire Protection's breathing apparatus are used by the military forces of
several countries and many U.S. firefighters rely on the

Scott Air-Pak

brand of self-contained breathing apparatus.

Customers

Tyco Fire Protection's customers include commercial enterprises, governmental entities, airports, commercial shipping companies,
transportation systems, healthcare facility operators, petrochemical facilities and homeowners. We market our fire detection and fire suppression systems to the majority of these customers through a
direct sales force. Customers for our fire sprinkler, fire detection and fire suppression products include distributors, commercial builders and contractors that install and service



fire
suppression and detection systems. Residential builders, contractors and developers are emerging customers for our sprinkler products given changing regulatory dynamics. Our customers for our
breathing apparatus include fire departments, municipal and state governments and military forces as well as major companies in the industrial sector.

Competition

Competition in the fire detection and fire suppression business varies by region. In North America, we compete with hundreds of smaller
contractors on a regional or local basis for the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems. In Europe, we compete with many
regional or local contractors on a country-by-country basis. In Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we compete with a few large fire detection and fire suppression contractors, as
well as with many smaller regional and local companies. We compete for fire detection and fire suppression systems contracts primarily on the basis of service, product attributes, quality and price.

Competition
for the manufacture and sale of our products is based on specialized product capacity, breadth of product line, price, training and support and delivery. The principal
competitors are specialty products manufacturing companies based in the United States, with other smaller competitors in Europe and Asia.

Tyco Flow Control

Our Tyco Flow Control segment designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing
products for process, oil and gas, power and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater market. We believe we are the world's leading manufacturer of flow control products. With 2011 net
revenue of $3.6 billion, our Tyco Flow Control segment comprises 21% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2010 and 2009, net revenue totaled $3.4 billion, or 20%, of our consolidated net
revenue and $3.5 billion, or 21%, of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. Tyco Flow Control is a global business with 31% of its sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), 31%
from the Americas, 23% from the Pacific region and 15% from Asia. On September 30, 2010 we sold our water business in Europe. This business met the held for sale and discontinued operations
criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Services and Products

Tyco Flow Control designs, manufactures and services a wide variety of valves, actuators, controls, pipes, fittings and heat tracing
products. Valve products include a broad range of industrial valves, including on-off valves, safety relief valves and other specialty valves. Actuation products include pneumatic,
hydraulic and electric actuators. Control products include limit switches, solenoid valves, valve positioners, network systems and accessories. For the water market, Tyco Flow Control offers a wide
variety of pipes and valves for water transmission applications. Tyco Flow Control is also a global provider of heat tracing services and products. In addition to these products, Tyco Flow Control
makes a variety of specialty products for environmental (emissions monitoring, water flow and quality monitoring, dust filter cleaning systems), instrumentation (manifolds, enclosures, isolation
valves) and other applications. We manufacture these products in facilities located throughout the world.

Tyco
Flow Control products are used in many applications including power generation, chemical, petrochemical, oil and gas, wastewater, pulp and paper, commercial irrigation, mining and
food and beverage. Tyco Flow Control also provides engineering, design, inspection, maintenance and repair services for its valves and related products.

Tyco
Flow Control products are sold under many trade names, including

Anderson Greenwood, Biffi, Crosby, Keystone, KTM, Raychem, Sempell,
Tracer

and

Vanessa.

Tyco Flow Control sells its services



and
products in most geographic regions directly through its internal sales force and in some cases through a network of independent distributors and manufacturers' representatives.

Customers

Tyco Flow Control's customers include businesses engaged in a wide range of industries, including power generation, chemical and
petrochemical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas exploration, production and refining, mining, water, food and beverage, marine and shipbuilding and other process industries. Customers include end users as
well as engineering, procurement and construction companies, contractors, original equipment manufacturers and distributors. Tyco Flow Control operates an extensive network of sales, service and
distribution centers to serve a wide range of global customers.

Competition

The flow control industry is highly fragmented, consisting of many local and regional companies and a few global competitors. We
compete against a number of international, national and local manufacturers of industrial valves as well as against specialized manufacturers on the basis of product capability, product quality,
breadth of product line, delivery, service capability and price. Our major competitors vary by region.

Backlog

See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information relating to
our backlog.

Intellectual Property

Patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets,
manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights,
including trademarks, patents and patent applications, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing
opportunities and misappropriation of our proprietary rights, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to: electronic security systems; fire protection products and systems, including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical,
gas, foam and water agents, piping, couplings, fittings for fluid systems; personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards; integrated systems for surveillance and control of
public transportation and other public works; heat tracing and floor heating systems; and flow control products, including valves, actuators and controllers and airflow control and sensing products.
We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant
and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and
use of the marks.

While
we consider our patents to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall operations are
dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Research and Development

We are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety
and reliability of our existing products and to expand the



applications
for which the uses of our products are appropriate. We continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment. Our
research and development expense was $147 million in 2011, $131 million in 2010 and $116 million in 2009.

Raw and Other Purchased Materials

We are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including gasoline. Materials are purchased from a large number of independent
sources around the world. There have been no shortages in materials that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. We enter into long-term supply contracts, using fixed or
variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions. Significant changes in certain raw material costs may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins.

Governmental Regulation and Supervision

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in
areas such as: consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states in which we
operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. Our Tyco Security Solutions business currently relies extensively upon the use of wireline and
wireless telephone service to communicate signals, and wireline and wireless telephone companies in the United States are regulated by the federal and state governments. Another example is our Tyco
Flow Control business, which is subject to strict regulations governing the import and export of goods and technologies across international borders, particularly with respect to "dual use" products,
which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation. In addition, government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our Tyco
Fire Protection business. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in
legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations, both positively and negatively. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business,
see Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other
things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals. We have received notification from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible
remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of
current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.



Given
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods, the ultimate cost of cleanup at
disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict. Based upon our experience, current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws, we concluded that it is probable
that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $38 million to $86 million as of September 30, 2011. As of September 30, 2011, we concluded that the best
estimate within this range is approximately $60 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $42 million is included in other liabilities
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of September 30, 2011, we employed approximately 102,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 39,000 are employed in the
United States and 63,000 are outside the United States. Approximately 22,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the
labor unions are generally good.

heading "Corporate Citizenship—Governance." The annual report to shareholders, charters and principles are not incorporated in this report by reference. We will also provide a copy of
these documents free of charge to shareholders upon request.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The
risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as technological obsolescence, labor relations, geopolitical
events, climate change and international operations.



Risks Relating to Our Businesses

General economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of
certain industries in which we operate. For example, demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial construction, the amount of discretionary consumer and
business spending, and the performance of the housing market, each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality. Economic weakness in some end markets has adversely affected certain of
our businesses. Events or conditions that adversely impact the health of the U.S. or global economies, or in the industries in which we operate, could have a material negative impact on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We face intense competition in each of our businesses, and competitive challenges from lower cost manufacturers. If we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global
market-place, our operating results may be adversely affected.

We operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service
providers, both domestically and on a global basis. Our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in Asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from
alternative service providers around the world. Key components of our competitive position are our ability to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully. This
requires continuous management focus on reducing costs, maintaining our competitive position and improving efficiency through cost controls, productivity enhancements and regular appraisal of our
asset portfolio. If we are unable to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or cost-effectiveness, or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global
marketplace, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.

Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to successfully compete with new and existing competitors by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve
market acceptance with acceptable margins.

Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards and
potential new entrants in our markets. For example, a number of cable and other telecommunications companies have introduced security services offerings, including interactive security services, that
are competitive with the products and services offered through our Tyco Security Solutions business. If these services are aggressively marketed and gain market acceptance, our ability to grow our
Tyco Security Solutions business, in particular our Pulse offering, could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, our future success depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:
identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; develop, acquire and maintain competitive products and services; enhance our products and services by adding innovative
features that differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors; and develop or acquire, manufacture and bring products and services to market quickly and
cost-effectively. Our ability to develop or acquire new products and services based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of
significant resources. These acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies,
products or services on a timely basis. Moreover, as we introduce new products such as Pulse, we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the product or in its installation, which could result
in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance. Even after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products.
As a result, these



products
may not achieve market acceptance and our brand images could suffer. In addition, our competitors may introduce superior designs or business strategies, impairing our brands and the
desirability of our products and services, which may cause consumers to defer or forego purchases of our products and services. In addition, the markets for our products and services may not develop
or grow as we anticipate. As a result, the failure of our technology, products or services to gain market acceptance, the potential for product defects or the obsolescence of our products and services
could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our Tyco Security Solutions business may experience higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives
of assets related to our security monitoring customers, increasing our depreciation and amortization expense.

If customers in our Tyco Security Solutions business segment are dissatisfied with our products or services and switch to competitive
products or services, or disconnect for other reasons, our attrition rates may increase. In periods of increasing attrition rates, Tyco Security Solutions' recurring revenue and results of operations
may be materially adversely affected. The risk is
more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty, as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide. Tyco amortizes the costs of ADT's acquired contracts and related
customer relationships based on the estimated life of the customer relationships. Internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated. If attrition rates were to rise
significantly, we may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

We have significant operations outside of the United States, which are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the United States.

We generated 52% of our net revenue outside of the United States in 2011. We expect net revenue generated outside of the United States
to continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenue. Business operations outside of the United States are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in
certain countries, such as:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal
systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of certain labor regulations outside of the
United States;

•

compliance with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and regulations;

•

changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging
markets;

•

the threat of nationalization and expropriation;

•

increased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions;

•

changes in enacted tax laws;

•

limitations on repatriation of earnings; and

•

fluctuations in revenues, operating margins and other financial measures due to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.



Changes
in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

Volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition, result of operations or cash flows.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest
rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our
net revenue derived from sales in non-U.S. markets for 2011 was 52% of our total net revenue, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to
represent a significant portion of our total net revenue. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar has strengthened in relation to the principle foreign currencies where we derive revenue as compared to a prior
period, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease, and vice-versa. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances, may have a
significant effect on our results of operations. Our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars, our functional currency (using
year-end exchange rates for balance sheet data and average exchange rates for statement of operations data).

In
addition, we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet, the prices of which have fluctuated
significantly in recent years. Increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services. We may not be able to pass on
these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, in
a declining price environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first-out method.

We
monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these
fluctuations. These hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our
contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of the Company's privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.

We are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic
information, and, in the normal course of our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers,
stockholders and employees. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information
are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our data by cybercrime or
otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely
impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. In addition, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for
business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns
that could result in disruptions to our



operations.
Increasingly, our security products and services are accessed through the Internet, and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services via the Internet may affect us and
could be detrimental to our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography
or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services.

If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely
basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may suffer.

We purchase materials, components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain
sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments
may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing
capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market
acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Failure to retain or attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.

Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training, motivating and developing employees, and in particular we strive to
attract, motivate and retain qualified managers to handle the day-to-day operations of a highly diversified organization. If we fail to retain and attract qualified personnel,
our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, excessive turnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies in certain of our businesses. The demand for experienced management in
certain geographic areas also makes it difficult to retain qualified employees. High turnover could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could adversely impact our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We have recognized substantial impairment charges in the past and may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future.

Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill,
intangibles and other long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant
declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. For example, during the
second fiscal quarter of 2009, we recognized aggregate goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $2.7 billion. We maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet,
and we believe that as of September 30, 2011 these balances are recoverable. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change. Additional impairments
to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis. Future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings
in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Divestitures involve risks,
including difficulties in the separation of operations, services,



products
and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain
environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and
other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other
significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line.

We may acquire companies and make investments in order to complement existing businesses. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant
resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:

•

diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;

•

difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;

•

inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;

•

potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships, or key customers of acquired companies or of us; and

•

assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies.

It
may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations. Any acquisitions or investments may
ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges.

Risks Related to the 2012 Separation

The proposed spin-offs of our North American residential security business and our flow control business are contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of
conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management, may not achieve the intended results, and may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us.

The proposed spin-offs of our North American residential security business and our flow control business are complex in
nature, subject to various conditions, and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions. We expect to file Registration Statements on Form 10 with the SEC that
will contain detailed information regarding the businesses proposed to be spun-off. Completion of these spin-off transactions will be contingent upon a number of factors,
including the approval of our shareholders, favorable rulings from tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the effectiveness of each of the Registration Statements, favorable
capital market conditions and other conditions. For these and other reasons, the spin-off transactions may not be completed as expected by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2012, if
at all. Additionally, execution of the proposed spinoff transactions will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract management from the operation of our businesses and
the execution of our other initiatives. Our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the
spin-off transactions. Further, if the spin-off transactions are completed, each of these transactions may not achieve the intended results and may result in costs that exceed
management's estimated amount of $700 million. Any such



difficulties
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

If the distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, we or our shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

We will request a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the
distributions of our North American residential security and flow control common shares to our shareholders, except for cash, if any, received in lieu of fractional shares, will qualify as
tax-free under Sections 355 and/or 361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("the Code") and (ii) certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the
distributions will quality for favorable treatment under the Code. Our receipt of the private letter ruling is critical to the completion of the spin-offs. The private letter ruling will
be based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and covenants provided by us regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. If any of the facts,
assumptions, representations or covenants provided in connection with the private letter ruling is inaccurate or incomplete or is violated in any respect, then we might not be able to rely on the
ruling. Furthermore, the IRS will not rule on whether the spin-offs satisfy certain requirements necessary for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Rather, the private letter ruling will be based on representations provided by us that those requirements have been or will be
satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. The 2012 Separation will also be conditioned on our receipt of an opinion of outside counsel, in form and substance
satisfactory to us, that confirms the tax-free status of the distributions. The opinion will rely on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and certain facts,
assumptions, representations and covenants provided by us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion will
not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.

If,
notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion, the spin-offs are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each U.S. holder of our
common stock who is subject to U.S. federal income tax who receives shares of our North American residential security and flow control businesses would generally be treated as receiving taxable
distributions of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received. Those distributions would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current
and accumulated earnings and profits. For each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent
of such stockholder's tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. In addition, internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the
spin-offs are ultimately determined to be taxable, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

The
tax sharing agreement that we will enter into with the North American residential security and flow control businesses prior to the completion of the spin-offs will
allocate for any taxes that arise if the spin-offs or certain internal transactions are determined to be taxable.

If the 2012 Separation is determined to be taxable for Swiss withholding tax purposes, we could incur significant Swiss withholding tax liabilities.

Generally, Swiss withholding tax of 35% is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders, regardless of the place of
residency of the shareholder. Beginning on January 1, 2011, distributions to shareholders out of contributed surplus accumulated on or after January 1, 1997 are exempt from Swiss
withholding tax. Accordingly, based on the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax Act, the Distribution should not be subject to Swiss federal withholding tax. Prior to the completion of the



proposed
spin-offs, we intend to obtain tax rulings from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration confirming that the distributions will not be subject to Swiss federal withholding tax. These rulings will
rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from Tyco regarding the past conduct of its businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the tax rulings, the
Swiss Federal Tax Administration could determine that the Distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions,
representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated. If the Distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable for withholding tax purposes, we and Tyco could incur material Swiss
withholding tax liabilities that could significantly detract from, or eliminate, the benefits of the spin-off.

If the 2012 Separation is completed, our operational and financial profile will change and we will be a smaller, less diversified company.

If completed, the 2012 Separation will result in Tyco being a smaller, less diversified company focused on our commercial fire and
security businesses, which represents a narrower business focus than we currently have. We will have a more limited business with greater concentration in the commercial market and may be more
vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs,
and cash flows will diminish. As a result, it is possible that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and it may be
difficult or more expensive for us to obtain financing. Our operations may also be impacted by a limited ability to attract new employees in a timely manner.

If the 2012 Separation is completed, there may be substantial changes in our stockholder base, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate following the
proposed spin-offs.

Investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that is large and operates in
multiple markets with a diversified product and services portfolio. If the proposed spin-off transactions are completed, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a
smaller company with its business concentrated in the commercial fire and security industry. These changes may not match some holders' investment strategies or meet minimum criteria for inclusion in
stock market indices or portfolios, which could cause investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease
following the completion of the proposed spinoff.

Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters

We are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are subject to a significant number of claims and are named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits, including claims for damages
arising out of the use or installation of our products or services, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior,
litigation related to environmental matters, product liability litigation (including asbestos-related claims), and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes. In certain
circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we
may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable
to protect us against potential loss exposures.



Legislative action by the U.S. Congress could materially adversely affect us.

Legislative action could be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties or regulations upon
which we rely, which would adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the
effect of disregarding our incorporation in Switzerland or limiting our ability as a Swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between Switzerland and the United States, we could be
subjected to increased taxation. Also, various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that deny, or would deny, government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their locations abroad. We cannot provide assurance that such legislation, if enacted, would not apply to us.

In
addition, there continues to be negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, companies that conduct substantial business in the U.S. but are domiciled abroad. We cannot provide
assurance that we will not be subject to such criticism as a result of our domicile in Switzerland.

Changes in legislation or governmental regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We operate in regulated industries. Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and local governmental
agencies with respect to safety of operations and equipment, labor and employment matters and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the United States are subject to regulation by state
regulatory authorities, and our international operations are regulated by the countries in which they operate and by extra-territorial laws. We and our employees are subject to various U.S. federal,
state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations, including many related to consumer protection. Most states in which we operate have licensing laws covering
the monitored security services industry and the construction industry. Our Tyco Security Solutions segment relies heavily upon both wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals, and
these technologies are regulated by both the federal and state governments. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise
disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and
regulations changed or we failed to comply, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws outside the United States.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial
increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC,
increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these
anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental and commercial corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with
anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal
acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries. Furthermore, we are subject to investigations by the DOJ and the SEC related to allegations that improper payments have been made by our
subsidiaries and third party intermediaries in recent years in violation of the FCPA. We have continued to report to the DOJ and the SEC the remedial measures that we have taken in response to the
allegations and our own



internal
investigations, and in February 2010, we initiated discussions with the DOJ and SEC aimed at resolving these matters, which remain ongoing. Although we have recorded our best estimate of
potential loss related to these or other similar matters, it is possible that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the resolution of this matter, as we may be
required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including
being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us.

Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Certain of
the products we manufacture are "dual use" products, which are products that may have both civil and military applications, or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation, and are often subject
to more stringent export controls. From time to time, we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports. Our policy mandates strict compliance with U.S.
and international trade laws. When we receive information alleging improper activity, our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, reporting our
findings to relevant governmental authorities. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate U.S. and/or foreign
laws. Such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and
could damage our reputation and our business prospects.

We continue to be responsible for a portion of our contingent and other corporate liabilities following the 2007 Separation of our electronics and healthcare
businesses, primarily those relating to pre-separation income tax liabilities.

Under agreements entered in connection with the 2007 Separation of our electronics ("TE Connectivity") and healthcare
("Covidien") businesses, we, Covidien and TE Connectivity have agreed to assume and be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of certain of our contingent and other corporate liabilities,
subject to certain exceptions. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. These
contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to pre-2007 Separation income tax liabilities. Liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated
companies are not allocated.

If
any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to
pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our
agreed-upon share
of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities including associated costs and expenses.

We are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install. These claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our
profitability.

We face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In
addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products, which could result in significant unexpected costs. Any insurance we maintain may not be
available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



In
addition, we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected. The nature of the services
we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. In an attempt to reduce this risk, our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts
contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these limitations will be enforced. Losses from such litigation could be material to our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are party to asbestos-related product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We, along with numerous other companies, are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to
asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained
asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. We have observed
an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims. Our strategy has been, and continues to be, to mount a
vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling suits before trial. We cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or
otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and
we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against the Company. Unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We
record an estimated liability related to pending claims and claims estimated to be received over the next seven years, including related defense costs, based on a number of key
assumptions and estimation methodologies. These assumptions are derived from claims experience over the past five years and reflect our expectations about future claim activities over the next seven
years. These assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate, and accordingly, we may incur additional liabilities in the future. A change in one or more of the inputs used to estimate the
asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims. Although it is possible that the Company will incur additional costs for
asbestos claims filed beyond the next seven years, we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time. We also record an asset that represents our best estimate of
probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities. There are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestos-related recoveries,
such as policy triggers, policy or contract interpretation, success in litigation in certain cases, the methodology for allocating claims to policies, and the continued solvency of the insurers or
other responsible parties. The assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate, and as a result, actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower
receivables or cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs. Due to these uncertainties, as well as our inability to reasonably estimate any additional asbestos liability for claims that may be
filed beyond the next seven years, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the cost, nor potential recoveries, of resolving the pending and all unasserted asbestos claims. Additionally,
we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond the next seven years, net of expected recoveries, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.



Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other
things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise
sanctioned by regulators.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.

We
have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where we and others
disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for
natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.
These projects relate to a variety of activities, including:

•

solvent, oil, metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and

•

structure decontamination and demolition, including asbestos abatement.

These
projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold
by us.

The
ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Based upon our experience, current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws, we concluded that it is probable
that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $38 million to $86 million as of September 30, 2011. As of September 30, 2011, we concluded that the best
estimate within this range is approximately $60 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $42 million is included in other liabilities
in the Consolidated Balance. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures
to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising
from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may
also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities or for existing
environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware.



Risks Related to Our Liquidity

Disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us, our customers and our suppliers, as access to liquidity may be negatively impacted by disruptions in
the credit markets, leading to increased funding costs or unavailability of credit.

In the normal course of our business, we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of
indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in the Company's subsidiaries. Although we believe we have sufficient
liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs, our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets. In 2009 and 2010, credit markets experienced
significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions, and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable. These factors may make it more
difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective
customers to commence new projects, as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. Disruptions in the financial markets have
had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses. These disruptions may have other unknown
adverse affects. Based on these conditions, our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants, including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and
sale/leaseback transactions.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot
provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of default
under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to
extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other
indebtedness. Furthermore, acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations, which could
have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our
outstanding indebtedness.

We estimate that our available cash, our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facilities will be
adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. However, material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar
contingencies could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we
need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



Such
an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other corporate purposes, including dividend payments;

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and

•

increase the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.

Risks Relating to Tax Matters

We share responsibility for certain of our, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement entered in connections with the 2007 Separation, we share responsibility for certain of our,
Covidien's and TE Connectivity's income tax liabilities that result in cash payments, based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we,
Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and
certain non-U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes
attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 Separation. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be
shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and TE Connectivity are
responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In connection with the execution of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we established receivables
from Covidien and TE Connectivity representing the amount we expected to receive for pre-Separation uncertain tax positions. We also established liabilities representing the fair market
value of our share of their estimated obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. As of September 30, 2011, we had recorded $73 million in other assets and $16 million in prepaid
expenses and other current assets representing the receivables from Covidien and TE Connectivity. We had also recorded $387 million in other liabilities and $49 million in accrued and
other current liabilities representing our estimated obligations to Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such
liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Covidien's
and TE Connectivity's tax liabilities.



Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these
examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular, with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 Separation. We are reviewing and
contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the IRS, a few significant items are expected to remain open
with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items, which primarily involve the treatment of
certain intercompany transactions during the period related to the audits, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, we may be required to litigate these matters. The calculation of our tax
liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and
record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due.
These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We have assessed our obligations under the Tax
Sharing Agreement and determined that the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement. However, such amount could differ materially from amounts that
are actually determined to be due, and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

If the distribution of Covidien and TE Connectivity common shares to our shareholders or certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the
2007 Separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

We have received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution of Covidien
and TE Connectivity common shares to our shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution of such shares, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, will qualify as
tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the
2007 Separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. The private letter rulings relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from
Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could
determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings
are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution.
If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, we would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Covidien and TE Connectivity common shares
distributed to our shareholders on June 29, 2007 over our tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we
would incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the 2007 Separation should be treated
as taxable transactions.



Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation in Switzerland

Swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of Tyco's securities.

Because of differences between Swiss law and U.S. state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of Swiss
companies and those incorporated in the U.S., it may not be possible to enforce in Switzerland, court judgments obtained in the United States against Tyco based on the civil liability provisions of
the federal or state securities laws of the United
States. As a result, in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, U.S. investors may find it difficult to:

•

effect service within the United States upon Tyco or its directors and officers located outside the United States;

•

enforce judgments obtained against those persons in U.S. courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States;
and

•

enforce against those persons in Switzerland, whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments
of U.S. courts, civil liabilities based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws.

Switzerland
and the United States do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The recognition and
enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the United States in Switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law. This statute provides in
principle that a judgment rendered by a non-Swiss court may be enforced in Switzerland only if:

•

the foreign court had jurisdiction pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law;

•

the judgment of such foreign court has become final and non-appealable;

•

the judgment does not contravene Swiss public policy;

•

the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law;
and

•

no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in Switzerland, or adjudicated in
Switzerland, or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in Switzerland.

As a result of our change of domicile from Bermuda to Switzerland and the increase in the par value of our shares, we may have less flexibility with respect to certain
aspects of capital management.

In connection with our change of domicile from Bermuda to Switzerland, we significantly increased the par value of our shares.
Currently the par value of our shares is CHF 6.70 (or approximately $7.44 based on the exchange rate in effect on November 7, 2011). Under Swiss law, we generally may not issue
registered shares for an amount below par value. As of November 7, 2011 the closing price of our ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") was $46.47. In the event there is a need
to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our registered shares is below our par value, we would need to obtain approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our
registered shares. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval in a timely manner. Obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy
statement with the SEC and convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans. If we were to receive shareholder approval to reduce the par value of our registered shares,
the



reduction
would decrease our ability to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital, which may subject shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

Our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world aggregating approximately 28 million square feet of floor space,
of which approximately 9 million square feet are owned and approximately 19 million square feet are leased. These facilities house manufacturing, distribution and warehousing operations,
as well as sales and marketing, engineering and administrative offices.

Tyco
Security Solutions operates through a network of offices, service and manufacturing facilities and warehouse and distribution centers located in North America, Central America,
South America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa. The group occupies approximately 8 million square feet, of which 2 million square feet are
owned and 6 million square feet are leased.

Tyco
Fire Protection operates through a network of offices, manufacturing facilities and warehouse and distribution centers located in North America, Central America, South America,
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The group occupies approximately 9 million square feet, of which 2 million square feet are owned and 7 million square feet are
leased.

Tyco
Flow Control has manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers throughout North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific
region. The group occupies approximately 11 million square feet, of which 5 million square feet are owned and 6 million square feet are leased.

In
the opinion of management, our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing
leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our lease obligations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

During the fiscal quarter ended December 24, 2010, certain contingencies related to the previously disclosed settlement of the

Stumpf v. Tyco
International Ltd.

class action lawsuit elapsed. This matter, which was subject to the liability sharing provisions of the
Separation and
Distribution Agreement with Covidien and TE Connectivity had previously received final court approval for its settlement. As a result of the lapsing of time periods for certain class members to state
a claim against the Company, the Company adjusted its remaining reserve for this and other legacy securities matters and recognized a net gain of $7 million during the quarter ended
December 24, 2010. Since June 2007, the Company has resolved substantially all of the legacy claims related to securities fraud and similar matters, with the exception of the claims related to
former management and Mr. Frank Walsh Jr., a former director, described below.

Tyco
is a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management, among which are affirmative cases brought by Tyco against Mr. Dennis L. Kozlowski, Tyco's former
chief executive officer, Mr. Mark Swartz, its former chief financial officer, and Mr. Frank Walsh Jr., a former director. In connection with these affirmative actions,
Mr. Kozlowski, through counterclaims, and Mr. Swartz, through demand letters, are seeking an aggregate of approximately $138 million allegedly due in connection with their
compensation and retention arrangements and under ERISA.



With respect to Mr. Kozlowski, on December 1, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of several of the
Company's affirmative claims against him before trial, while dismissing all of Mr. Kozlowski's counterclaims for pay and benefits after 1995. With respect to Mr. Swartz, on
March 3, 2011, the same Court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment. The Court further ruled that issues related to damages will need to be resolved at trial. No trial date has been
set. The Company expects Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz to contest these decisions. As a result, the Company has and will continue to maintain the reserve recorded in its Consolidated
Balance Sheet for the amounts allegedly due under their compensation and retention arrangements and under ERISA until the appeals process is complete. Although the ultimate resolution of these matters
could differ materially from these estimates, the Company does not believe such resolution would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Tyco
has also brought an action against Mr. Walsh in connection with the damages suffered by Tyco arising from Mr. Walsh's breach of his fiduciary duties to Tyco. In
October 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Tyco's affirmative claims for recovery of damages against Mr. Walsh. Tyco is pursuing an appeal. This
affirmative matter, and the affirmative matters against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz, are not subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.
Separately, Mr. Walsh is pursuing a New York state court claim against the Company asserting his entitlement to indemnification. This action is subject to the liability sharing provisions of
the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative
cleanup methods. As of September 30, 2011, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $38 million to $86 million. As of
September 30, 2011, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $60 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities
and $42 million is included in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company
believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos Matters

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits
based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial
products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third-parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate
defendants. While the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large
percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a result, have been dismissed by the courts. The Company's strategy has been, and continues to be, to mount a vigorous defense
aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, the Company cannot predict the
extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future. As of September 30, 2011, there were approximately 4,500 lawsuits pending against the Company, its subsidiaries or
entities for which the Company has assumed responsibility. Each lawsuit typically includes several claims, and the Company has determined that there were approximately 5,600 claims outstanding as of



September 30,
2011, which reflects the Company's current estimate of the number of viable claims made against it, its affiliates or entities for which it has assumed responsibility in
connection with acquisitions or divestitures. This amount includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted, identify incorrect defendants or are duplicative of other actions.

For
a detailed discussion of asbestos-related matters, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Tax Matters

In connection with the 2007 spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement
that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre-2007 Separation income tax liabilities. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share
27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S.
income tax returns. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. Consistent with the sharing provisions of the Tax
Sharing Agreement, Tyco had a net receivable from Covidien and TE Connectivity of $89 million and $114 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010,
respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, the Company had recorded $387 million and $398 million, respectively, in other liabilities, and
$49 million and $156 million, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities. During 2011, the Company made a net cash payment of $113 million to Covidien and TE
Connectivity related to the resolution of certain audit and pre-Separation tax matters.

Tyco
and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised
issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related
interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate.

For
a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's income taxes, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, the Company has received and responded to various allegations and other
information that certain improper payments were made by the Company's subsidiaries and agents in recent years. For example, two subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business in Italy have been
charged, along with numerous other parties, in connection with the Milan public prosecutor's investigation into allegedly improper payments made to certain Italian entities. During the fourth quarter
of 2011, the Company's subsidiaries were acquitted of these charges. The Company reported to the DOJ and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to these
and other allegations and its internal investigations. In 2005, the Company informed the DOJ and the SEC that it retained outside counsel to perform a Company-wide baseline review of its
policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the FCPA, and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. The Company has and will
continue to communicate with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review and follow-up investigations, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of
potential improper conduct identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. The baseline review, which has been completed, has revealed that some business practices may
not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements, and in February 2010, the Company initiated discussions with the DOJ and SEC aimed at resolving these matters, which remain ongoing. Although the Company
has recorded its best estimate of potential loss related to this matter, it is



possible
that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the resolution of this matter, as the Company may be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions
on future conduct, consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants,
each of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Covidien
and TE Connectivity agreed, in connection with the 2007 Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its responses regarding these matters. Any judgment required to be
paid or settlement or other cost incurred by the Company in connection with the FCPA investigation matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution
Agreement, which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics businesses of the Company to Covidien and TE Connectivity, respectively, and provides that the Company
will retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations. Any liabilities not primarily related to a particular segment will be shared equally among the Company, Covidien and TE
Connectivity.

As
previously disclosed, in early 2007 certain former subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business were charged, prior to their divestiture, by the German Federal Cartel Office
("FCO") with engaging in anti-competitive practices, in particular with regard to its hydrant, valve, street box and fittings business. The Company investigated this matter and determined
that the conduct
may have violated German competition law. The Company is cooperating with the FCO in its ongoing investigation of this violation. The Company has recorded its best estimate of potential loss related
to this matter. However, it is possible that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the resolution of this matter, as the Company may be required to pay material
fines, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

During
the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company has concluded that its best estimate of probable loss for these compliance matters is $34 million in the aggregate, which the
Company recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended September 30, 2011. Due to the sharing provisions in the Separation
and Distribution Agreement, the Company has also recorded receivables from Covidien and TE Connectivity related to these compliance matters in other current assets in the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2011.

ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic
Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund (the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the Fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan such as the Fund, the
employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between Grinnell Fire
Protection Systems, SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669.

ERISA
requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan. A plan's assessment of
withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration, and ERISA requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration. If the employer
prevails in arbitration (and any subsequent appeals), its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest. The Fund's total withdrawal liability assessment against SimplexGrinnell
is approximately $25 million. The quarterly withdrawal liability payments are $1.1 million, $18.7 million of which has been cumulatively paid through September 30, 2011.
While the ultimate outcome is uncertain, SimplexGrinnell believes that it has strong arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the Fund,



and
it plans to vigorously defend against the Fund's withdrawal liability assessment. The matter is currently in arbitration. The Company has made no provision for this contingency and believes that
its quarterly payments are recoverable.

Broadview Security Contingency

On May 14, 2010, the Company acquired Broadview Security, which is a business that was formerly owned by The Brink's Company.
Under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, as amended (the "Coal Act"), The Brink's Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries at July 20, 1992 (including certain legal
entities acquired in the Broadview Security acquisition) are jointly and severally liable with certain of The Brink's Company's other current and former subsidiaries for health care coverage
obligations provided for by the Coal Act. A Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Associate ("VEBA") trust has been established by The Brink's Company to pay for these liabilities, although the trust may
have insufficient funds to satisfy all future obligations. At the time of its spin-off from The Brink's Company, Broadview Security entered into an agreement in which The Brink's Company
agreed to indemnify it for any and all liabilities and expenses related to The Brink's Company's former coal operations, including any health care coverage obligations. The Brink's Company has agreed
that this indemnification survives the Company's acquisition of Broadview Security. The Company has evaluated its potential liability under the Coal Act as a contingency in light of all known facts,
including the funding of the VEBA, and indemnification provided by The Brinks Company. The Company has concluded that no accrual is necessary due to the existence of the indemnification and its belief
that The Brink's Company and VEBA will be able to satisfy all future obligations under the Coal Act.

ADT Dealer Litigation

As previously reported, in 2002, the SEC's Division of Enforcement conducted an investigation related to past accounting practices for
dealer connect fees that ADT had charged to its authorized dealers upon purchasing customer accounts. The investigation related to accounting practices employed by the Company's former management,
which were discontinued in 2003. Although the Company settled with the SEC in 2006, a number of former dealers and related parties have filed lawsuits against the Company in the United States and in
other countries, including a class action lawsuit filed in the District Court of Arapahoe County, Colorado, alleging breach of contract and other claims related to ADT's decision to terminate certain
authorized dealers in 2002 and 2003. In February 2010, the Court granted a directed verdict in ADT's favor dismissing a number of the plaintiffs' key claims. Upon appeal, the Colorado Court of Appeals
affirmed the verdict in ADT's favor in October 2011. While it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the Colorado lawsuit or other lawsuits stemming from dealer
terminations, the Company does not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Matters

In addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and product
and general liability claims, incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. With respect to many of these claims, the Company either self-insures or maintains
insurance through third-parties, with varying deductibles. While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of any such
proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows beyond
amounts recorded for such matters.

All
dividends declared through the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were denominated in Swiss francs. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal
2011 all dividends declared were denominated in U.S. dollars. Amounts for 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal 2011 in the table above represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of Swiss francs converted at
the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate shortly before the payment dates. Dividends proposed by Tyco's Board of Directors are subject to shareholder approval. Shareholders approved annual dividends
of CHF 0.90 and $1.00 at annual meetings held on March 10, 2010, and March 9, 2011, respectively. At the time of approval, in March 2010, the equivalent U.S. dollar amount of the
CHF 0.90 dividend was $0.84.

Dividend Policy

Prior to May 2011, the Company paid dividends in the form of a return of share capital from the Company's registered share capital.
These payments were made free of Swiss withholding taxes. The Company now makes dividend payments from its contributed surplus equity position in its Swiss statutory accounts. These payments are also
made free of Swiss withholding taxes. Unlike payments made in the form of a reduction to registered share capital, which are required to be denominated in Swiss francs and converted to U.S. dollars at
the time of payment, payments from the contributed surplus account may effectively be denominated in U.S. dollars. Under Swiss law, the authority to declare dividends is vested in the Company's
shareholders.

We
expect to obtain shareholder approval of the annual dividend amount out of contributed surplus each year at our annual general meeting, and we expect to distribute the approved
dividend amount in four quarterly installments, on dates determined by our Board of Directors. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will depend upon
many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other relevant factors. Future dividends will be
proposed by our Board of Directors and will require shareholder approval.

The
Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan ("2004 Plan") provides for the award of stock options, restricted stock
units, performance share units and other equity and equity-based awards to Board members, officers and non-officer employees. Amounts shown in column (a) include, in addition to
20,566,093 shares that may be issued upon the exercise of stock options, 229,837 deferred stock units ("DSU") and dividend equivalents earned on such DSUs, 3,303,312 shares that may be issued upon the
vesting of restricted stock units, and 2,235,598 shares that may be issued upon the vesting of performance share units ("PSU"), assuming a target payout for PSUs. There are currently no restricted
share awards outstanding under the 2004 Plan. Amount in column (c) includes the aggregate shares available under the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP I"), LTIP II
and the 2004 Plan, as the shares formerly available under the LTIP I and LTIP II have been rolled into the 2004 Plan.

(2)

The
LTIP I allowed for the grant of stock options and other equity or equity-based grants to Board members, officers and
non-officer employees. Amount in column (a) includes 263,588 shares to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and 868,359 DSU grants and dividend equivalents earned on such
DSUs. No additional grants may be made under the LTIP I, the LTIP II, or any acquired plans.

(3)

Shares
available for future issuance under the Tyco Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which represents the number of remaining shares
registered for issuance under this plan. All of the shares delivered to participants under the ESPP were purchased in the open market. The ESPP was suspended indefinitely during the fourth quarter of
2009.

(4)

Under
the terms of the 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan adopted in March 2004, no additional options, equity or equity-based grants will be made
to Board members, officers and non-officer



employees
under the LTIP or the LTIP II. LTIP II allowed for the grant of stock options and other equity or equity-based grants to employees who are not officers of Tyco. Under this plan,
non-officer employees or former employees of Tyco or a subsidiary could receive: (i) options to purchase Tyco common shares; (ii) stock appreciation rights;
(iii) awards payable in cash, common shares, other securities or other property, based on the achievement of performance goals; (iv) dividend equivalents, consisting of a right to
receive payments equivalent to dividends declared on Tyco common shares; and (v) other stock-based awards as determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee ("Committee"). The
exercise price of options and stock appreciation rights would generally be fair market value on the date of grant, but could be lower in certain circumstances. No individual could receive awards for
more than 12,000,000 shares (or 3,000,000 shares on a post-reverse stock split basis) in any calendar year. Terms and conditions of awards were determined by the Committee. Awards could be
deferred, and could be payable in any form the Committee determined, including cash, Tyco common shares, other securities or other property. The Committee may modify awards in recognition of unusual
or nonrecurring events, including a change of control. The shares granted under the LTIP II will be issued at vesting under the 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan.

(5)

The
Tyco International Ltd. United Kingdom ("UK") Savings Related Share Option Plan ("SAYE") is a UK Inland Revenue approved plan for
UK employees pursuant to which employees were granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at a 15% discount off of the market price at time of grant. Employees made monthly
contributions that were, at the election of the employee, used for the purchase price of shares or the contribution could have been returned to the employee. The total amount of shares that may have
been purchased at the end of the three years of service was equal to the total of the monthly contributions, plus a tax-free bonus amount equal to a multiple of the aggregate amount of
monthly contributions, divided by the option price. An option will generally be exercisable only during the period of six months following the three-year period. The plan was administered
by the Company's International Benefits Oversight Committee, appointed by the Committee. The International Benefits Oversight Committee, among other things, determined when to grant options and set
the option price. The SAYE Plan was approved on November 3, 1999 for a ten year period and has expired according to its terms on November 3, 2009. The International Benefits Oversight
Committee has not approved any additional grants since the last annual grant on October 9, 2008 and it has not applied for approval of a replacement for the SAYE Plan at this time.

In
connection with the acquisition of Broadview Security in May 2010, options outstanding under the Brink's Home Security
Holdings, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan ("2008 Equity Plan") and the Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. Non-Employee Director's Equity Plan were converted into options to
purchase Tyco common shares. Shares available represent the number of shares available for issuance under future awards from the 2008 Equity Plan, which are now available for future issuance under
Tyco's 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan.

The
transactions described in the table above represent shares acquired by the Company from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with
the vesting of restricted shares during the quarter ended September 30, 2011. The average price paid per share is calculated by dividing the total cash paid for the shares by the total
number of shares repurchased. During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, there were no common shares repurchased under the $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board
of Directors in April 2011 ("2011 Share
Repurchase Program"). Approximately $700 million remained outstanding under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program as of September 30, 2011.



Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data of Tyco. This data is derived from Tyco's Consolidated Financial
Statements for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. Tyco has a 52 or
53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday in September. Fiscal years 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were all 52-week years, while fiscal 2011 was a 53-week year.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell our European water business. The business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and
therefore has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented below. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity,
formerly our Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively. These businesses are classified as discontinued operations in fiscal 2007. This selected financial data should be read in conjunction
with Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report as well
as the section of this Annual Report titled Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the
Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but
not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Introduction

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the
laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we", the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD"), in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we realigned our Safety Products segment between our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments to create two new segments: Tyco Security
Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. Tyco Security Solutions consists of the former ADT Worldwide segment as well as the portion of the former Safety Products segment that manufactures security
products including intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection consists of the former Fire Protection Services segment as well as a number of businesses from
the former Safety Products segment including the fire suppression, fire detection and life safety products businesses. In addition, various businesses were realigned between Tyco Security Solutions
and Tyco Fire Protection.

As
a result of this realignment, as well as the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business further described below, we began operating in the following
business segments:

•

Tyco Security Solutions

designs, sells, installs, services and monitors
electronic security, productivity and lifestyle enhancement systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. In addition, Tyco Security Solutions designs, manufactures and
sells security products including intrusion, security, access control, electronic article surveillance and video management systems.

•

Tyco Fire Protection

designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services
fire detection and fire suppression systems and building and life safety products for commercial, industrial and governmental customers.

•

Tyco Flow Control

designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes,
fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for general process, energy and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater markets.

We
also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other.

Overview

Net revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased by $339 million, or 2.0%, to $17.4 billion as compared to the
year ended September 24, 2010. Net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 despite the sale of our majority interest in the Electrical and Metal Products business, which contributed
$1.4 billion of revenue during the year ended September 24, 2010 and $347 million during the year



ended
September 30, 2011. Net revenue increased across all of our segments mainly attributable to strength in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments and to a lesser
extent our Tyco Flow Control segment. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates also impacted net revenue by $503 million, or 3.0%. In addition, because the Company's fiscal year
ends on the last Friday in September, fiscal 2011 consisted of 53 weeks, as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2010 and 2009. As a result, fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated
$143 million, or 0.8%, of revenue from the additional week.

Service
revenue, which is primarily recurring in nature, represented approximately 45% of our overall revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to 41% and 40% for
2010 and 2009, respectively. Service revenue as a percentage of net revenue increased due to the divestiture of our Electrical and Metal Products business, which did not have a significant service
component as well as due to strength in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection businesses. Service revenues are principally derived from our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire
Protection businesses, and represent a consistent source of revenue from monitoring and maintenance services under contractual agreements. Recurring revenue in our Tyco Security Solutions business
grew to approximately 57% of Tyco Security Solutions' total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 which is primarily due to the integration of Broadview Security, compared to
approximately 56% for the year ended September 24, 2010, and 52% for the year ended September 25, 2009. In the Tyco Fire Protection business, service revenue remained steady as a
percentage of Tyco Fire Protection's total revenue at 38% in 2011 and 2010, as compared to 36% in 2009. For the year ended September 30, 2011, non-service revenue in Tyco Security
Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection improved slightly compared to the prior annual periods, due to strength in systems installation and related products and product sales in Tyco Security Solutions and
product sales in Tyco Fire Protection. These improvements were partially offset by continued weakness in our Tyco Flow Control segment's Water and Environmental Systems business.

Operating
income for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased $521 million, or 33%, to $2.1 billion, as compared to operating income of $1.6 billion for
the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 includes a net gain on divestitures of $230 million primarily related to the sale of a majority
interest in our Electrical and Metal products business compared to a net gain on divestitures of $40 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income was also favorably impacted
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.8%. The increase in operating income in 2011 also reflects strong growth in our Tyco Security Solutions business. Operating
income was favorably impacted for the year ended September 30, 2011 due to lower restructuring and asset impairment charges of $87 million as compared to $145 million for the year
ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 included acquisition and integration costs of $39 million as compared to $35 million for
the year ended September 24, 2010.

Our
cash balance was $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. We generated approximately
$2.4 billion of cash from operating activities and utilized $1.3 billion of cash in investing activities and $1.5 billion of cash in financing activities during the year ended
September 30, 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2011, approximately $1.0 billion of cash was generated from divestitures, primarily related to $713 million for the
sale of the majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business and $264 million for the sale of our European water business, which was presented in net cash provided by (used in)
discontinued investing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. During the year ended September 30, 2011, uses of cash primarily included $1.3 billion to repurchase our
common shares, $788 million of capital expenditures, $656 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $614 million to purchase customer contracts in our Tyco Security
Solutions segment and $458 million to pay cash dividends.



Recent Transactions

On September 19, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three
separate, publicly traded companies consisting of the Company's North American residential security business, its flow control business, and its commercial fire and security business. The 2012
Separation is expected to be completed by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2012 through a tax-free pro rata distribution of all of the equity interest in the flow control and North
American residential security business.

Completion
of the proposed separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors and shareholders, receipt of tax opinions and rulings and
the filing and
effectiveness of registration statements with the SEC. The separation will also be subject to the completion of any necessary financing.

During
fiscal 2011, we made a number of strategic investments within our three core businesses. On April 29, 2011, our Tyco Security Solutions segment completed the acquisition of
Signature Security Group for $184 million, net of cash acquired of $2 million. Signature Security Group is an electronic security company operating in Australia and New Zealand primarily
in small business and residential markets. On June 29, 2011, the Company's Flow Control segment finalized the acquisition of a 75% equity interest in privately-held KEF
Holdings Ltd. ("KEF"), a vertically integrated valve manufacturer in the Middle East, for approximately $295 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Additionally, in
connection with the acquisition we acquired $64 million of debt which was substantially paid as of September 30, 2011. On September 1, 2011, our Fire Protection segment completed the
acquisition of Chemguard Inc. ("Chemguard") for approximately $130 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Chemguard is a provider of firefighting foam concentrates and
equipment, foam systems, services and specialty chemicals. On September 15, 2011, the Company reached an agreement to acquire Visonic Ltd. ("Visonic"), a global developer and
manufacturer of electronic security systems and components, for approximately $100 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Following the
close of the transaction, the Company intends to combine Visonic with the Company's Tyco Security Solutions segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

On
November 9, 2010, we announced that we entered into an investment agreement (the "Agreement") to sell a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business to an
affiliate of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the "Investor"). We formed a newly incorporated holding company, Atkore International Group Inc. ("Atkore"), to hold our
Electrical and Metal Products business. On December 22, 2010, the transaction closed and the Investor acquired shares of a newly-created class of cumulative convertible preferred stock of
Atkore (the "Preferred Stock"). The Preferred Stock initially represented 51% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Atkore. In connection with the closing, we
received cash proceeds of approximately $713 million and recorded a gain of $259 million during the first quarter of 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we recorded
working capital adjustments of $11 million that reduced the gain on disposal. The gain on disposal is recorded within restructuring, asset impairments and divestiture (gains) charges, net in
our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

On
September 30, 2010, we sold our water business in Europe, which was part of our Tyco Flow Control segment. The business met the discontinued operations criteria and has been
included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale was completed for approximately $264 million in cash proceeds, net of $7 million of cash divested on sale, and a
pre-tax gain of $172 million, which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

References
to the segment data are to the Company's continuing operations. As discussed above, the Company realigned certain business operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2011
and



accordingly
has recast prior period segment amounts. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in
retailer anti-theft systems is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and
labels utilized in retailer anti-theft systems was misclassified as service revenue. Such item had no effect on net revenue, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows. No
changes have been made to previously filed financial statements or in the comparative amounts presented herein, as the effect in prior periods is not material. Revenue related to the sale of such
electronic tags and labels reflected as service revenue was $286 million in 2009 and related cost of services was $176 million in 2009.

Net
revenue for Tyco Security Solutions of $8.6 billion increased by $892 million, or 11.5%, during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended
September 24, 2010. Net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $235 million, or 3.0%, substantially all of which was related to
the acquisition of Broadview Security in May 2010, and to a lesser extent, Signature Security Group in April 2011, offset by divested revenue from our French Security business which was sold in March
2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $192 million, or 2.5%. In addition, an estimated $38 million, or 0.5%, of revenue is attributable
to the additional week in fiscal 2011, all of which is non-recurring. The remaining increase in net revenue was primarily due to incremental account growth, net of attrition, in the
recurring revenue businesses in North America and Rest of World ("ROW"), and strength in our non-recurring businesses related to construction project activity and security system upgrades
in North America and retail store expansion activity in ROW.

Net
revenue for Tyco Security Solutions of $7.7 billion increased by $359 million, or 4.9%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to
September 25, 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $239 million, or 3.2%. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by the net impact
of acquisitions and divestitures of $72 million, or 1.0%, which was primarily the result of $193 million in net revenue estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition
partially offset by $109 million of divested revenue relating to our French security business.



Recurring Net Revenue

Recurring revenue is generated from contractual monitoring and maintenance agreements that are long-term in nature, and is
primarily driven by the addition or loss of customer accounts and increases or decreases in average revenue per customer.

Recurring
revenue increased by $612 million, or 14.2%, to approximately $4.9 billion during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended
September 24, 2010. Recurring net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $322 million, or 7.5%, relating to our acquisition of
Broadview Security in May 2010, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Signature Security Group in April 2011. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted recurring revenue
by $84 million, or 2.0%. Customer accounts grew during the year ended September 30, 2011 by approximately 0.1 million, or 1.1%, to a total of 9.0 million accounts. The
increase in average monthly revenue per customer of $0.73 from the year ended September 24, 2010 to the year ended September 30, 2011 was partially due to favorable foreign exchange
rates along with incremental account growth, net of attrition, in the North America and ROW regions.

Recurring
revenue increased by $434 million, or 11.2%, to approximately $4.3 billion, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended
September 25, 2009, as a result of growth in customer accounts of approximately 1.5 million, or 20.3%, to a total of approximately 8.9 million accounts as of September 24,
2010. Approximately 1.4 million customer accounts were acquired on May 14, 2010 in connection with the Broadview Security acquisition. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and
changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted recurring revenue by $149 million, or 3.9%, and $116 million, or 3.0%, respectively, in 2010.

Non-Recurring Net Revenue

Non-recurring revenue is generated from product sales (including sales and installation of electronic security and products
related to retailer anti-theft systems, as well as other life safety systems) and from services such as the provisioning of armored guards and one-time repair, security system
upgrades or inspection jobs. Non-recurring net revenue increased by $280 million, or 8.1%, to $3.7 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the
year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted non-recurring net revenue by $108 million, or 3.1%. In addition, an estimated
$38 million, or 1.1%, of non-recurring revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures of $89 million or 2.6%, primarily relating to the sale of our French Security business in March 2010. The remaining increase was primarily due to strength in
commercial end markets with new retail store expansion activity in ROW and increased demand within North America for construction projects and security systems upgrades.



Non-recurring
revenue declined by $75 million, or 2.1%, to approximately $3.4 billion during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year
ended September 25, 2009, due to lower sales volume primarily as the result of weakness in the commercial end market, which declined at a slower rate than the same period in the prior year.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation, product sales and other service revenue by $122 million, or 3.5%, while the net impact of acquisitions and
divestitures resulted in an unfavorable impact of $76 million, or 2.2%.

Revenue by Geography

North American revenue consists of residential and small business, primarily a recurring revenue business, and commercial, primarily a

North
America

Net
revenue in North America increased by $666 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended
September 24, 2010, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted North American revenue by $25 million,
or 0.6%. Residential and small business net revenue increased by 19.9% compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Broadview Security. Commercial net
revenue increased by 8.2%, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily as a result of an increase in construction projects and security system upgrades in the commercial end
markets which was partially offset by softness in the retail market.

Net
revenue in North America increased by $251 million, or 6.0%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily as
the result of the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which favorably impacted net revenue by an estimated $193 million, or 4.6%, as the result of the acquisition of Broadview
Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $48 million, or 1.1%. Residential and small business net revenue increased by 15.3% compared to the
year ended September 25, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Broadview Security. Commercial net revenue decreased by 4.8% due to the decline in systems installation and product sales as
the result of weakness in the commercial market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year.

Europe,
Middle East, and Africa

Net
revenue in EMEA decreased by $12 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24,
2010, primarily due to the unfavorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $138 million, or 7.9%, resulting from the sale of certain businesses, including the French security
business in March 2010, and several smaller businesses in Europe over the course of fiscal 2010. The decrease was partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency



exchange
rates of $70 million, or 4.0%. Stronger systems installation across Continental Europe also favorably increased net revenue.

Net
revenue in EMEA decreased by $137 million, or 7.3%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, as favorable changes
in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.2%, were more than offset by a decline in systems installation and other service revenue as a result of weakness in the commercial end
market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Additionally, EMEA net revenue was unfavorably impacted by $120 million, or 6.4%, due to the impact of
divestitures.

Rest
of World

Net
revenue in ROW increased by $185 million, or 15.3%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24,
2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $83 million, or 6.9%. The remaining increase in net revenue in ROW was primarily attributable to retail store
expansion, increases in the customer account bases and increased systems installation activity in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions.

Net
revenue in ROW increased by $200 million, or 19.9%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily due to
recurring revenue growth in both Latin American and Asia Pacific regions resulting from customer account growth. The Asia-Pacific region experienced an increase in system installation,
products sales and other service revenue which was partially offset by a decrease in the Latin American region due to a slowdown in commercial and retailer end markets. Net revenue in the Rest of
World geographies was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $111 million, or 11.0%.

Tyco
Security Products

Net
revenue in Tyco Security Products increased by $53 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended
September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $14 million, or 4.0%. The remaining increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth
across multiple product lines globally.

Net
revenue in Tyco Security Products increased by $45 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $20 million, or 6.5%. Additionally, net revenue increased due to higher volume primarily related to the introduction
of several new products.

Operating income of $1.4 billion increased by $271 million, or 24.9%, in the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended
September 24, 2010. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended September 30, 2011 continued to be favorably impacted by higher sales volume, efficiencies gained through
restructuring actions taken in prior years and other cost containment activities. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $23 million, or 2.1%.
Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $25 million of restructuring charges, net as compared to $62 million of restructuring charges, net for the
year ended September 24, 2010. In addition, included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 is $33 million of acquisition and integration costs primarily
related to the acquisition of Broadview Security and Signature Security Group, as compared to $32 million of acquisition and integration costs during the year ended September 24, 2010.
Included in the operating income for the prior year comparable period is a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business and a curtailment
gain of $12 million, which was recognized upon the freezing of certain defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, as compared to the absence of similar charges for the year ended
September 30, 2011.

Operating
income of $1.1 billion increased by $1.6 billion in the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Operating
income for the year ended September 25, 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 billion recorded at our ADT EMEA, Access Controls and Video Systems ("ACVS")
and Sensormatic Retail Solutions reporting units and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million. Operating income for the year ended September 24, 2010 was positively impacted by
the shift to higher margin recurring revenue. Additionally, 2010 operating income was favorably impacted by the net impact of savings realized through previous restructuring and cost containment
actions, and a curtailment gain of $12 million
recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of intangible assets primarily
relating to the Broadview Security acquisition. During the year ended September 24, 2010, $62 million of net restructuring charges were incurred, of which $14 million related to
restructuring actions associated with the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to $118 million of restructuring charges, net during the year ended September 25, 2009.
Additionally, management estimated that $2 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions was incurred during the year ended September 25, 2009. Fiscal 2010 also
included a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business, and $32 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the
acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to a $6 million loss on divestitures and nil of acquisition costs during fiscal 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably
impacted operating income by $33 million, or 6.4%.

Revenue
related to the sale of certain products is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to the first quarter
of fiscal 2011, revenue related to certain systems installation products was misclassified as service revenue. The service revenue and systems installation revenue during the years ended
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 have not been changed for this misclassification, as the effect is not material. The impact of the misclassification for the years ended
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 would have been to decrease service revenue by $37 million and $36 million, respectively, with a corresponding increase to systems
installation within revenue from product sales. If the revenue from the sale of these products during the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 were classified as product
sales, service revenue would have increased $110 million, or 6.5% for the year ended September 30, 2011, and $62 million, or 3.8% for the year ended September 24, 2010. In
addition, product sales would have increased by $123 million, or 4.4% for the year ended September 30, 2011, and decreased $172 million, or 5.8% for the year ended
September 24, 2010.

Net
revenue for Tyco Fire Protection of $4.7 billion increased by $233 million, or 5.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended
September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $126 million, or 2.8%. In addition, an estimated $60 million, or 1.3% of revenue
is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture in our Fire Protection services business as a result of adopting a new accounting standard
unfavorably impacted net revenue by $72 million, or 1.6%. The remaining increase in revenue was primarily driven by increased volume in product sales as a result of generally improved
end-market demand, implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures, increased services revenue as a result of continued focus on driving recurring revenue and
continued emerging markets expansion, partially offset by a decline in systems installation revenue as a result of project selectivity across all regions.

Net
revenue for Tyco Fire Protection decreased $110 million, or 2.4%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Net
revenue was unfavorably impacted by acquisitions and divestitures of $37 million, or 0.8%. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of
$130 million, or 2.8%. The remaining decrease was primarily due to weakness in commercial markets and project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects.



Revenue from product sales

Systems installation and related products

Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Revenue from systems installation
decreased by $4 million, or 0.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably
impacted systems installation revenue by $45 million, or 2.8%, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture discussed above unfavorably impacted systems installation by $51 million, or
3.1%. Revenue from systems installation was also unfavorably impacted by project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects across all regions.

Revenue
from systems installation decreased by $123 million, or 7.1%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation revenue by $56 million, or 3.2%. Despite the favorable impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased due to
decreased upgrade activity from customers, and project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin project across all regions.

Product sales

Revenue from product sales increased by $164 million, or 14.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to
the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted product revenue by $24 million, or 2.1%. The remaining increase in net revenue was driven
by increased volumes due to improved end-market demand and implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures.

Revenue
from product sales decreased by $50 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Product
revenue was unfavorably impacted by the estimated impact of $32 million, or 2.7% of divestitures. This decrease was partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which
favorably impacted product revenue by $13 million, or 1.1%. The remaining decrease was due to weakness in end-market demand.

Service revenue

Service revenue consists of inspection, maintenance, monitoring and repair of fire detection, suppression and other life safety
systems. Service revenue increased by $73 million, or 4.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency
exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by $56 million, or 3.2%, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture discussed above unfavorably impacted service revenue by
$21 million, or 1.2%. The remaining increase in service revenue was as a result of management's continued focus on expanding our recurring service revenue across all regions.

Service
revenue increased by $63 million, or 3.8%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Changes in foreign
currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by $61 million, or 3.7%. Despite the favorable impact of foreign currency, service revenue was flat due primarily to weakness in the
European markets.

Operating
income of $534 million increased $74 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $15 million, or 3.3%. Other factors that contributed to the net increase in operating income and operating
margin were increased sales volume, implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures in the products business, project selectivity in the systems installation business, and
cost-containment initiatives. These increases were partially offset by additional environmental remediation costs of $11 million, net of recoveries related to an isolated site, and
a $5 million decrease to operating income related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture. Included in operating income for the prior year comparable period is a curtailment gain of
$8 million, which was recognized upon the freezing of certain defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom. Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was
$38 million of restructuring charges, net as compared to $42 million of restructuring charges, net for the year ended September 24, 2010. Included in operating income for the year
ended September 30, 2011 was $29 million of losses on divestitures as compared to $2 million of losses on divestitures for the year ended September 24, 2010.

Operating
income increased $440 million during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Operating income during the year
ended September 25, 2009 was negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $420 million recorded at the EMEA Fire and Life Safety reporting units. Additionally, operating income
in 2010 was favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment actions, $14 million of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and to a lesser extent, a curtailment
gain of approximately $8 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. There were $42 million of restructuring charges, net and a loss
on divestiture of $2 million during the year ended September 24, 2010, compared with $62 million of restructuring charges, net and nil of divestiture charges incurred in 2009.
Additionally, management estimates that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Operating income in 2009 was also unfavorably affected
by the decreased sales volume discussed above.

Net
revenue for Tyco Flow Control of $3.6 billion increased by $266 million, or 7.9%, during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended
September 24, 2010. The increase in revenue was primarily due to favorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $183 million, or 5.4%. In addition, an estimated
$45 million, or 1.3%, of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011. Net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of
$7 million, or 0.2%. The remaining increase was primarily due to continued strength in end-market demand in our Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses partially offset
by weakness in our Water and Environmental Systems business. The decreased revenue in our Water and Environmental Systems business was primarily due to the completion of a large desalinization project
in Australia that commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and was completed at the beginning of the second quarter fiscal 2011.



Net
revenue for Tyco Flow Control of $3.4 billion decreased by $122 million, or 3.5%, during the year ended year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year
ended September 25, 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $218 million, or 6.2%, as well
as the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $10 million, or 0.3%. This was more than offset by decreased revenues due to reduced volume in the Valves and Controls business driven by
decreased demand in end markets.

Operating
income of $413 million increased by $3 million, or 0.7%, in the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010.
Operating income was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $22 million, or 5.4%. The increase in operating income was primarily due to continued strength in the
Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses, which was more than offset by weakness in our Water and Environmental Systems business. Restructuring charges, net were $11 million during
the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $25 million in the prior year. The year ended September 30, 2011 included a $6 million gain on divestiture, compared to a
$1 million gain on divestiture for the year ended September 24, 2010.

Operating
income of $410 million decreased by $86 million, or 17.3%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25,
2009, primarily due to decreased volume in our valves business and an expected loss related to completion of a long-term construction project of approximately $18 million. These
declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $31 million, or 6.3%. The decline in operating income was also partially offset by savings realized
through cost containment and restructuring actions. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $24 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net during both fiscal 2010 and fiscal
2009. Additionally, management estimated that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during the year ended September 25, 2009.

Corporate expense decreased $266 million, or 57.6%, to $196 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 as
compared to an expense of $462 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. The decrease in corporate expense during the year ended September 30, 2011 is related to a
$253 million net gain on divestitures, primarily related to the divestiture of our Electrical and Metal Products business, compared to a $4 million net loss on divestitures during the
year ended September 24, 2010. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by cost containment initiatives during the year ended September 30, 2011, as well as a lower net asbestos charge of
$11 million recorded in connection with the Company's valuation of its asbestos-related liabilities during the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to a $52 million, net asbestos
charge recorded during the year ended September 24, 2010. Corporate also recorded a $20 million charge in relation to a legacy legal matter during the year ended September 30,
2011 as compared to nil during the year ended September 24, 2010. Additionally, net restructuring charges and acquisition charges for the year ended September 30, 2011 were
$12 million and $1 million respectively, while the year ended September 24, 2010 included restructuring charges and acquisition charges of $1 million and $3 million,
respectively. The year ended September 30, 2011 included $24 million of separation costs primarily related to



professional
fees and banking services. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Corporate
expense decreased $108 million, or 18.9%, to $462 million for year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $570 million for the year ended
September 25, 2009. Corporate expense during 2009 was negatively affected by approximately $125 million of charges related to legacy securities matters partially offset by a
$16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive. Restructuring charges decreased to $1 million for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to
$10 million in the year ended September 25, 2009. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring charges. These decreases in
Corporate expenses were partially offset by a $52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to a $37 million net asbestos charge in 2009, both of
which were recorded in conjunction with the valuation of our asbestos-related liabilities and insurance assets. In addition, $4 million of divestiture charges, net, and $3 million of
acquisition costs were recorded during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $6 million of divestiture charges, net, and nil of acquisition costs for the year ended
September 25, 2009.

Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was $34 million in 2011, as compared to $31 million and $44 million in 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Interest income increased in 2011 primarily due to increased investment yields compared to 2010, while investment yields continue to be lower than those experienced in 2009.

Interest
expense was $244 million in 2011, as compared to $284 million and $301 million in 2010 and in 2009, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on total debt
outstanding as of September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 was 5.9%, 6.3% and 6.6%, respectively. The decreases in interest expense and weighted-average interest
rate are primarily related to savings realized from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon notes over the past year, including the redemption of 6.375% notes due 2011 and issuance of
3.375% notes due 2015 during the third quarter of 2010 and the maturity of 6.75% notes due 2011 and issuances of the 3.75% notes due 2018 and 4.625% notes due 2023 during the second quarter of 2011.

Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net of $16 million in 2011, primarily relates to our share of Atkore's net loss of $9 million, which is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $7 million. See Note 7 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other
expense, net of $75 million in 2010, primarily related to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of our 6.375% public notes due
2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of an
increase in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

Other
expense, net of $7 million in 2009, primarily related to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE
Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk
related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends.

Effective Income Tax Rate

Our effective income tax rate was 17.2% and 10.9% during the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010,
respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily



related
to the tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business during the first quarter of 2011, a non-recurring
transaction generating a tax benefit in 2010 and a release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2010. The effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable audit resolutions in
multiple jurisdictions during 2011. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors,
such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.

The
effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion for which almost no tax benefit
was available. Additionally, taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law
changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the non-U.S. deferred tax assets.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,400 million and $1,379 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and
recorded when the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. The Company believes
that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax
liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are
recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

2009 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments

Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, we test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets with its carrying amount.

We
began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial
markets, including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our Electrical Metal Products segments. Although we considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute
triggering events during the first quarter of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecasted results, restructuring
actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed. Reporting units within our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments
continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Additionally, our Electrical Metal Products reporting unit continued to be
negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the non-residential construction market. We determined that these underlying events and circumstances constituted
triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts. Specifically, we concluded that our EMEA Security,
ACVS and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Tyco Security Solutions segment the EMEA Fire and Life Safety reporting units within the Tyco Fire Protection segment and our
Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit



within
the Electrical and Metal Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. Furthermore, we determined that
certain indefinite-lived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment
related to the retailer end market of our Tyco Security Solutions segments. As a result of the triggering events, we performed long-lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment
tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights.

Fair
value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates)
discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital of market participants. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a number of factors, including operating results,
business plans, economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery, cash flow forecasts, market data, and our overall market capitalization. Based on the factors described above,
actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting unit's products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash flows used in the second
quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth
quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the range of the weighted-average cost of capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our
products and services. The results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting
units. We recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after-tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non-cash
impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009.

Indefinite-lived
intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings
method, which include the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to
the underlying intangible assets. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, our estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of our Tyco Security Solutions segment Sensormatic
tradename as well as certain Tyco Security Solutions segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the
impairment test indicated that the Tyco Security Solutions Sensormatic tradename and Tyco Security Solutions franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts. As
a result, we recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after-tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non-cash
impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to use judgment in
making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The
following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the
relevant information available at the end of each period.

Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring-Related Assets

—Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its
electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber
system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property,



plant
and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue
resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a
similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related
deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated
method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 265% for residential subscriber pools and 135% to 360%
for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a
straight-line method with a 14-year life for non-pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining
balances written off upon customer termination.

Revenue Recognition

—Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction-related
projects are recorded primarily under the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related
total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long-term
contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable.

Sales
of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. We assess our revenue arrangements to
determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting.
Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance
services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price
for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") if available, Third Party Evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or
estimated selling price if neither VSOE or TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is
limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the non-contingent up-front consideration received at the time of installation,
since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services.

Product
discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Loss Contingencies

—Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other claims that arise
in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and
actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Asbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables

—We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as
defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and
defense costs predominantly based on claim experience



over
the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of
uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, we use multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential
outcomes to estimate the range of loss. We have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase
significantly as the projection period lengthens.

In
connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, we record asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos-related
insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In
determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers.

Annually,
we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the
estimated asbestos-related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we re-evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect
changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgments applied in the recognition and
measurement of asbestos-related assets and liabilities.

Income Taxes

—In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and
judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax
and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre-tax operating
income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future
taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more-likely-than-not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our
income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future
taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional
valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our
future earnings.

Changes
in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the Company's
deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and



other
tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust
these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different
from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these
amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no
longer necessary.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairments

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and
more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including
expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available) and other market data.

We
elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill
impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on
forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for market participants. A market
approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent
available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered
potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting
unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of
goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value
of goodwill.

We
recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Additionally, we determined as part
of the assessment that our Water and Environmental Systems reporting unit within our Flow Control segment had limited recoverability of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by 6.9%. As of September 30, 2011, the Water and Environmental Systems goodwill balance was $298 million. While historical performance and current expectations have
resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is
not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its goodwill.

Fair
value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and
assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to
negatively affect the



underlying
key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows:

•

A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and
prices) especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets;

•

An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree;

•

Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and

•

Unexpected regulatory changes.

While
historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in
the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material.

Long-Lived Assets

—Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets,
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating
cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for
which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long-lived assets to be
disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the
amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of
long-lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may be overstated or understated.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

—Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in
determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect
demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions
resulting in actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive
plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the
present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis
point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $75 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately
$2 million. We consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long-term periods, asset class performance expectations as well
as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected long-term return on plan assets. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets
would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $4 million.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the
operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world. The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition,
we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to committed revolving credit facilities and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our
operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses, dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we currently estimate that we will incur
approximately $700 million in costs related to the 2012 Separation. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be
adequate to cover our operational and business needs in the foreseeable future.

We
had $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. Cash generated by operating
activities decreased to $2.4 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Cash used in investing activities
was $1.3 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Cash used in financing activities was
$1.5 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010.

As
of September 30, 2011, our shareholder's equity was $14.2 billion and our total debt was $4.1 billion. In addition, we had lines of credit totaling approximately
$1.5 billion, none of which were drawn. Our ratio of total debt to total capital (the sum of our short- and long-term debt and shareholders' equity) was 23% as of both
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. This ratio is a measure of our long-term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility.

On
January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $250 million
aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net cash proceeds of approximately
$494 million. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of
$516 million.

On
March 24, 2011, TIFSA, as the Borrower, and the Company as the Guarantor, entered into a Four-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, providing for revolving credit
commitments in the aggregate amount of $750 million (the "Credit Agreement"). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, TIFSA and the Company terminated the existing
Three-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated June 24, 2008, which provided for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $500 million, and which was
scheduled to expire in June 2011. At the same time, TIFSA also reduced the lenders' commitments under its existing Five-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated April 25, 2007,
from an aggregate of $1.19 billion to $750 million, and which is scheduled to expire in April 2012.

decrease in accrued and other liabilities, a $187 million increase in accounts receivable and a $137 million increase in inventories.

The
net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $106 million in 2010. The significant changes in working capital included a $119 million increase in
accounts payable and an $88 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets which were partially offset by a $108 million increase in inventories.

The
net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $128 million in 2009. The significant changes in working capital included a $346 million decrease in
inventory, a $191 million decrease in
accounts receivable, a $106 million net decrease in contracts in progress, partially offset by a $337 million decrease in accounts payable and a $138 million decrease in income
taxes, net.

During
2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $114 million, $160 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as
held for sale) and $152 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our
restructuring activities.

During
the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 we made required contributions of $78 million, $82 million and
$60 million, respectively to our U.S. and



non-U.S.
pension plans. We also made voluntary contributions of approximately $15 million, nil and $22 million to our U.S. plans during the years ended September 30,
2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. We anticipate contributing at least the minimum required to our pension plans in fiscal year 2012 of $44 million for our U.S.
plans and $60 million for our non-U.S. plans.

Income
taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $196 million, $255 million, and $281 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Net
interest paid, related to continuing operations were $195 million, $234 million, and $249 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Cash flow from investing activities

We made capital expenditures of $788 million, $718 million, and $702 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 is expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2011 and is also expected to exceed depreciation expense.

During
2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $614 million, $559 million, and $543 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 565,000, 501,000 and
512,000 customer contracts for electronic security services within our Tyco Security Solutions segment.

During
2011, we paid cash for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $656 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million, which primarily related to the
acquisitions of Signature Security Group within our Tyco Security Solutions segment, KEF Holdings Ltd. within our Tyco Flow Control segment and Chemguard within our Tyco Fire Protection
segment. During 2010, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $600 million, net of cash acquired of $137 million, which primarily related to the acquisition
of Broadview Security within our Tyco Security Solutions segment and Hiter within our Tyco Flow Control segment.

During
2011, we received cash proceeds, net of cash divested of approximately $1 billion for divestitures. The cash proceeds primarily related to the sale of a majority interest
in our Electrical and Metal Products business of $713 million, which is presented in continuing operations and $264 million for the sale of our European water business which is presented
in discontinued operations. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Cash flow from financing activities

On January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on
January 15, 2018 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received
net cash proceeds of approximately $494 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of
all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million.

In
connection with the acquisition of KEF during the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company acquired $64 million of debt which was substantially paid as of
September 30, 2011.

During
the second half of fiscal 2011, TIFSA issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper
program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2011, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, TIFSA had made payments of
$200 million to extinguish all of its commercial paper outstanding.

On
May 5, 2010, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net
proceeds of



approximately
$495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. On May 28, 2010, the Company used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional cash
on hand to redeem all of its 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029, outstanding at that time, which aggregated $878 million in principal amount.

On
October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.125% notes due 2014, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA
received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount.

On
January 9, 2009, TIFSA issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 8.5% notes due on January 15, 2019, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the
Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $745 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. On January 15, 2009, TIFSA made a payment of $215 million to
extinguish all of its 6.125% notes, due 2009 which matured on the same date. Additionally, in November 2008, TIFSA made a payment of $300 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2008.

Pursuant
to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market,
or pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased approximately 30 million
common shares for approximately $1.3 billion under the 2011, 2010 and 2008 share repurchase programs, which completed both the 2010 and 2008 programs. During the year ended September 24,
2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common shares for approximately $900 million under the 2008 share repurchase program.

On
March 9, 2011, our shareholders approved an annual dividend on our common shares of $1.00 per share, to be paid from contributed surplus in four installments of $0.25
per share. During the 2011, 2010 and 2009 fiscal years, we paid cash dividends of approximately $458 million, $416 million and $388 million, respectively. See Note 17 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Management
believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and operational business needs for the foreseeable future, including capital
expenditures, quarterly dividend payments, share repurchases and separation-related expenses.

Commitments and Contingencies

(2)

Interest
payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. As of
September 30, 2011, we had swapped an aggregate of approximately $1.2 billion of fixed for floating rate debt.

(3)

Excludes
interest.

(4)

Purchase
obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services.

(5)

Other
long-term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and
postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these
obligations. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $104 million in 2012 and we expect to pay $5 million in 2012 related to
postretirement benefit plans.

As
of September 30, 2011, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $270 million and gross interest and penalties of $60 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable
estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the current status of our
income tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between nil and $60 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months.

As
of September 30, 2011, we had total commitments of $1.5 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $750 million of which expires on March 24, 2015 and
$750 million of which expires on April 25, 2012. As of September 30, 2011, there were no amounts drawn under these revolving credit facilities.

TIFSA's
bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain
customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business.

During
the second half of fiscal 2011, TIFSA, the Company's finance subsidiary, issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers.
Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
connection with the 2007 Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2007 Separation.
Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and TE Connectivity has assumed 31% of certain Tyco
pre-Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which, as of September 30, 2011, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the
spin-offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party.

Backlog

We had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.7 billion and $9.5 billion as of September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010, respectively. We expect that approximately 88% of our backlog as of



September 30,
2011 will be filled during the next 12 months. Backlog by segment was as follows ($ in millions):

September 30,


September 24,


Tyco Security Solutions

—


$

9,651

$

9,476

Backlog
increased $175 million, or 1.8%, to $9.7 billion as of September 30, 2011. The net increase in backlog was primarily related to an increase in recurring
revenue-in-force in our Tyco Security Solutions segment and increased bookings in our Tyco Flow Control segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bookings
in our Tyco Fire Protection segment. Tyco Security Solutions' backlog includes recurring revenue-in-force and long-term deferred revenue for upfront fees paid by
customers for Tyco Security Solutions' owned security systems. Revenue-in-force represents 12 months' revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under
contract in the security business. Tyco Security Solutions' backlog of $6.8 billion and $6.6 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, consists
primarily of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion of recurring revenue-in-force as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, and
$1.1 billion of deferred revenue for both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. Tyco Security Solutions' backlog increased $166 million, or 2.5%. The net increase was
primarily due to an increase in revenue-in-force, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates by $36 million, or 0.5%. Tyco Flow Controls'
backlog increased by $262 million, or 17.7%. The net increase was primarily due to increased bookings for several large projects within our Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted Tyco Flow Controls' backlog by $7 million, or 0.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline in bookings in our Water and
Environmental Systems business. Tyco
Fire Protections' backlog decreased by $165 million, or 12.7%. Tyco Fire Protections' backlog was unfavorably impacted by the deconsolidation of a joint venture as a result of adopting a new
accounting standard. In addition, backlog decreased in EMEA as a result of project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects. These decreases were partially offset by increases in
our North American and global Fire Safety Products businesses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted Tyco Fire Protections' backlog by $17 million, or 1.3%.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sale of Accounts Receivable

Certain of our international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short-term financing mechanisms. The
aggregate amount outstanding under our international accounts receivable programs was not material as of September 30, 2011 or September 24, 2010.

Guarantees

Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted
work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be
triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax
Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the 2007 Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to
recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to
the 2007 Separation we provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to various Covidien and TE Connectivity operating entities. To the extent these guarantees were not
assigned in connection with the 2007 Separation, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. These obligations were not material to us as of September 30, 2011.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets,
environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax
liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of
management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
of September 30, 2011, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $724 million.

For
a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions.
These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate
and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial
instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative
financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non-functional currency cash flows are used with the
goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so.

We
do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor
its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A-/A3 long-term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial
institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party.

Foreign Currency Exposures

We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange
contracts. During 2011, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The
market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency
exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 30, 2011. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency
exchange rates would result in a $32 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates
would result in a $39 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the
underlying transactions.

During
the third quarter of 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), the Company's finance subsidiary, entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge
its Euro denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately $224 million and $255 million as of September 30, 2011, and
September 24, 2010, respectively. The potential impact from a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $19 million net increase in other comprehensive
income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $24 million net decrease in other comprehensive income.

As
of September 30, 2011, and September 24, 2010, $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in
nature. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, we recorded $16 million of cumulative transaction gain, $24 million
of cumulative translation loss and nil, respectively, through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans.



Interest Rate Exposures

Our long-term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed-rate instruments. The Company manages its interest
rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. These
interest rate swap transactions manage the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixed-rate debt to variable rates. During the second quarter of 2011, TIFSA also
entered into interest rate swaps contracts to hedge $155 million notional amount of the 4.125% public notes due 2014. In these contracts, TIFSA agrees with financial institutions acting as
principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. In
connection with the maturity of the 6.75% public notes during the second quarter of 2011, TIFSA settled the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24,
2010, the total gross notional amount of the Company's interest rate swap contracts was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative
to interest rates as of September 30, 2011 would result in a $29 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates
relative to interest rates as of September 30, 2011 would result in a $30 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts.

Commodity Exposures

We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into
hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2011 and 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper
which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Additionally, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of September 30, 2011 would not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of September 30, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.



There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, these internal controls.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Management's
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011.

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm
that audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, and their report is also included in this Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discussion of Management's Responsibility

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
information appearing in this report. We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to being recognized as a leader in governance, controls, clarity and transparency of financial
statements. We are committed to making honesty, integrity and transparency the hallmarks of how we run Tyco. We believe that to succeed in today's environment requires more than just compliance with
laws and regulations—it requires a culture based upon the highest levels of integrity and ethical values. Expected behavior starts with our Board of Directors and our senior team leading
by example and includes every one of Tyco's global employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and business partners. One of our most crucial objectives is continuing to maintain and build on the
public, employee and shareholder confidence that has been restored in Tyco. We believe this is being accomplished; first, by issuing financial information
and related disclosures that are accurate, complete and transparent so investors are well informed; second, by supporting a leadership culture based on an ethic of uncompromising integrity and
accountability; and third, by recruiting, training and retaining high-performance individuals who have the highest ethical standards. We take full responsibility for meeting this
objective. We maintain appropriate accounting standards and disclosure controls and devote our full commitment and the necessary resources to these items.

Dedication to Governance, Controls and Financial Reporting

Throughout 2011, we continued to maintain and enhance internal controls over financial reporting, disclosures and corporate governance
practices. We believe that a strong control environment is a dynamic process. Therefore, we intend to continue to devote the necessary resources to maintain and improve our internal controls and
corporate governance.

Our
Audit Committee meets regularly and separately with management, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors, and our internal auditors to discuss financial reports,
controls and auditing.

We,
our Board and our Audit Committee are all committed to excellence in governance, financial reporting and controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2011 and September 24,
2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2011. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2011, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 16, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2011, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 of the Company and our report dated November 16, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial statement schedule.

TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

—The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a corporation
organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been
prepared in United States dollars ("USD") and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Certain
information described under article 663-663h of the Swiss Code of Obligations has been presented in the Company's Swiss statutory financial statements for the year ended
September 30, 2011. Unless otherwise indicated, references to 2011, 2010 and 2009 are to Tyco's fiscal years ending September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25,
2009, respectively.

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company realigned its Safety Products segment between its ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments to create two new segments:
Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. Tyco Security Solutions consists of the former ADT Worldwide segment as well as the portion of the former Safety Products segment that manufactures
security products including intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection consists of the former Fire Protection Services segment as well as a number of
businesses from the former Safety Products segment including the fire suppression and life safety products businesses. In addition, various businesses were realigned between Tyco Security Solutions
and Tyco Fire Protection. See Note 21.

As
a result of this realignment, as well as the sale of a majority interest in the Electrical and Metal Products business (See Note 3), the Company has three core businesses: Tyco
Security Solutions, Tyco Fire Protection and Tyco Flow Control.

Revenue
related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti-theft systems is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to
the first quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti-theft systems was misclassified as service revenue. Such item had no
effect on net revenue, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows. No changes have been made to previously filed financial statements or in the comparative amounts presented herein, as
the effect in prior periods is not material. Revenue related to the sale of such electronic tags and labels reflected as service revenue was $286 million in 2009 and related cost of services
was $176 million in 2009.

Effective
June 29, 2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity, formerly the Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into separate,
publicly traded companies (the "2007 Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders.

The
Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday in September. Fiscal 2011 was a 53-week year which ended on September 30, 2011.
Fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 52-week years.

Principles of Consolidation

—Tyco conducts business through its operating subsidiaries. The Company consolidates companies in which it owns or controls
more than fifty percent of the voting shares or has the ability to control through similar rights. Also, the Company consolidates variable interest entities ("VIE") in which the Company has the power
to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

acquisition
or up to the date of disposal. References to the segment data are to the Company's continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these
Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring charges, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows associated with asset impairments, useful lives for
depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies (including legal, environmental and asbestos reserves), insurance reserves, net realizable value of inventories, fair values of financial instruments,
estimated contract revenue and related costs, income taxes and tax valuation allowances, and pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these
estimates.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company recognizes revenue principally on four types of transactions—sales of products, sales of security systems,
billings for monitoring and maintenance services and contract sales.

Revenue
from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass. This is generally when the products reach the
free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Provisions
for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in determining sales in the same period the
related sales are recorded. These provisions are based on terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Sales
of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. The Company assesses its revenue
arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate
unit of accounting. Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for
monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy
of estimated selling price for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") if available, Third Party Evidence ("TPE") if
VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE or TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the
estimated selling price hierarchy or the non-contingent up-front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement
with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services.

For
transactions in which the Company retains ownership of the subscriber system asset, fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the contract term. Non-refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract, along with associated direct and incremental selling costs, are deferred
and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

While
the Company does not expect situations where VSOE is not available for sales of security systems and services, if such cases were to arise the Company would follow the selling
price hierarchy to allocate arrangement consideration.

Revenue
from the sale of services is recognized as services are rendered. Customer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are
rendered and the associated deferred revenue is included in current liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

Contract
sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction-related projects are recorded primarily under the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The
extent of progress toward completion is generally measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost at completion. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the
effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in
the period in which they become determinable. Estimated warranty costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under
percentage-of-completion accounting.

Accounts
receivable and other long-term receivables included retainage provisions of $62 million at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, of which
$44 million and $45 million were unbilled, respectively. These retainage provisions consist primarily of fire protection contracts and become due upon contract completion and acceptance.
As of September 30, 2011 the retainage provision included $49 million that is expected to be collected during fiscal 2012.

Research and Development

—Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of product sales, which amounted to
$147 million, $131 million and $116 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred and building and
overhead expenses.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, which amounted to
$206 million, $164 million and $131 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Acquisition Costs

—Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 5.

Translation of Foreign Currency

—For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that account in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars,
assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign
currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders' equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including dividends declared in Swiss francs through April 2011 and the impact of foreign currency derivatives related to
operating activities, are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses and other expense, net, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in Tyco's
receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

—Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market value.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

—Property, Plant and Equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense for
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $695 million, $654 million and $610 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when incurred. Except for pooled
subscriber systems, depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

Up to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Subscriber systems

Accelerated method up to 15 years

Other machinery, equipment and furniture and fixtures

2 to 21 years

See
below for discussion of depreciation method and estimated useful lives related to subscriber systems.

Subscriber System Assets and Related Deferred Revenue Accounts

—The Company considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its
electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber
system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which
Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets represent capitalized equipment (e.g. security control
panels, touchpad, motion detectors, window sensors, and other equipment) and installation costs associated with electronic security monitoring arrangements under which the Company retains ownership of
the security system assets in a customer's residence or place of business. Installation costs represent costs incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use. The Company pays property taxes on the
subscriber system assets and upon customer termination, may retrieve such assets. These assets embody a probable future economic benefit as they generate future monitoring revenue for the Company.

Costs
related to the subscriber system equipment and installation are categorized as property, plant and equipment rather than deferred costs. Deferred costs associated with subscriber
system assets represent direct and incremental selling expenses (i.e. commissions) related to acquiring the customer. Commissions related to up-front consideration paid by customers
in connection with the establishment of the monitoring arrangement are determined based on a percentage of the up-front fees and do not exceed deferred revenue. Such deferred costs are
recorded as non-current assets and are included in the other assets line item within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Subscriber
system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where
the



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Company
has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for
the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the same month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in
North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging
from 160% to 265% for residential subscriber pools and 135% to 360% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight-line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is
greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight-line method with a 14-year life for non-pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in
Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination.

Long-Lived Asset Impairments

—Tyco reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating
cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for
which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if
any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairments

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and
more frequently if triggering events occur (see Note 10). In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic
projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors which require judgment in applying them to the
analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The Company performed its annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on the first day of
the fourth quarter of 2011.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, the Company first compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined
utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's future budgets discounted using market participants' weighted-average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash
flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired
and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's
goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of
goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as
if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

combination.
Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.

Indefinite
lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights are tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method.

Dealer and Other Amortizable Intangible Assets, Net

—Intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer relationships and intellectual
property. Certain contracts and related customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the
ADT dealer program. Acquired contracts and related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price.

During
the first six months (twelve months in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from
customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a
reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset.

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program described above are amortized in pools determined by the same month and year of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over
the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship.

The
estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles is 15 years. The Company
amortizes dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. Other contracts and related customer relationships, as well as intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks, copyrights
and unpatented technology, are amortized on a straight-line basis over 4 to 40 years. The Company evaluates the amortization methods and remaining useful lives of intangible assets
on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the amortization method or remaining useful lives.

Investments

—The Company invests in debt and equity securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity securities that represent less
than twenty percent ownership are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within
shareholders' equity for available for sale securities unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management determines the proper
classification of investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
classifications as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other
equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. Each reporting period, the Company evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that they are
recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For equity investments in which the Company exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies but does not control,
the equity method of accounting is used. The Company's share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and was not material in any period
presented.

Product Warranty

—The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. Products are warranted against defects in material and
workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Generally, product warranties are implicit in the sale; however, the customer may purchase
an extended warranty. However, in most instances the warranty is either negotiated in the contract or sold as a separate component. The warranty liability is determined based on historical information
such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain instances estimated property damage.

Environmental Costs

—Tyco is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Tyco provides for expenses associated with
environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Income Taxes

—Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss
carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, including consideration of tax planning strategies, it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Asbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables

—The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as
defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future
claims and defense costs is predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next
seven years on an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, the Company uses
multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. The Company has concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period
will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens.

In
connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, the Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The Company's estimate of
asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for
pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and
creditworthiness of the insurers.

Insurable Liabilities

—The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these
liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon
historical claims experience. Certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a risk-free rate of return when the pattern and timing of
the future obligation is reliably determinable. The impact of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 was to reduce the obligation
by $16 million and $21 million, respectively. The Company maintains a captive insurance company to manage certain of its insurable liabilities. The captive insurance company holds
certain investments in an escrow account for the purpose of providing collateral for the Company's insurable liabilities. See Note 9. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party
insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Financial Instruments

—The Company may use interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward and option contracts and commodity swaps to manage risks
generally associated with interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity prices. Derivatives used for hedging purposes are designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure
at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract are highly effective at offsetting the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at
inception of the hedge and are expected to remain highly effective over the life of the hedge contract.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet
items related to operating activities are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to
economically hedge dividends declared in Swiss francs through April of 2011 are reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of other expense, net along with offsetting
transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Beginning in May 2011 the Company no longer declares dividends in Swiss francs. Derivatives used to manage the exposure to changes in interest
rates are reported in interest expense along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are included in the cumulative
translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent they are effective. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive loss and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. The Company classifies cash flows associated with the
settlement of derivatives consistent with the nature of the transaction being hedged. The Company did not have any cash flow hedges during 2011. The ineffective portion of all hedges, if any, is
recognized currently in earnings as noted above. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings.

Reclassifications

—As a result of the segment realignment, prior period segment amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.
See Note 21.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance for the
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The selling price used for each
deliverable will be based on VSOE if available,



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

TPE
if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The guidance requires arrangements under which multiple revenue generating activities to be performed be
allocated at inception. The residual method under the existing accounting guidance has been eliminated. The guidance became effective for Tyco for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
modified beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which amended the existing guidance for the consolidation of VIEs, to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special
purpose entity. The guidance also replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a VIE with an approach focused
on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the significant activities of a VIE, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that may be significant to the VIE.
The guidance became effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company's population of VIE's is primarily composed of joint ventures that are not material to the Company's
consolidated operations, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the deconsolidation of a joint venture in the Tyco Fire Protection segment,
but it did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income. The
guidance amended the reporting of Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI") by eliminating the option to present OCI as part of the Statement of Changes in Shareholder's Equity. The amendment will not impact
the accounting for OCI, but only its presentation in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The guidance requires that items of net income and OCI be presented either in a single continuous
statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements which include total net income and its components, consecutively followed by total OCI and its components to arrive at
total comprehensive income. The guidance must be applied retrospectively and is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
assessing the timing of its adoption of the guidance.

In
September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which expanded and enhanced the existing disclosures related to multi-employer pension and other postretirement
benefit plans. The amendments require additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures to provide more detailed
information including, the significant multi-employer plans in which the Company participates, level of the Company's participation and contributions, financial health and indication of
funded status which will provide users of financial statements with a better understanding of the employer's involvement in multi-employer benefit plans. The guidance must be applied
retrospectively and is effective for Tyco for the fiscal 2012 annual period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the timing of its adoption of the guidance along with
what impact, if any, the guidance will have on its annual disclosures.

In
September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which amends the process of testing goodwill for impairment. The guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors
to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not, defined as having a likelihood of more than fifty percent, that the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, performing the traditional two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. If an entity concludes otherwise, it would be required to perform the
first step of the two step goodwill impairment test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill
impairment test. However, an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test. The guidance is effective for Tyco for
interim and annual impairment testing beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the timing of its adoption of the guidance.

2. 2012 Separation Transaction

On September 19, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies consisting of the
Company's North American residential security business, its flow control business, and its commercial fire and security business. The 2012 Separation is expected to be completed by the end of the
third calendar
quarter of 2012 through a tax-free pro rata distribution of all of the equity interest in the flow control and North American residential security business.

Completion
of the proposed separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors and shareholders, receipt of tax opinions and rulings and
the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the SEC. The separation will also be subject to the completion of any necessary financing.

During
the quarter and year ended September 30, 2011, the Company incurred $24 million of costs within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's
Consolidated Statement of Operations, primarily related to professional fees and banking services.

3. Divestitures

The Company has continued to assess the strategic fit of its various businesses and has pursued the divestiture of certain businesses which do not align with its long-term
strategy.

Fiscal

On
November 9, 2010, the Company announced that it entered into an investment agreement (the "Agreement") to sell a majority interest in its Electrical
and Metal Products business to an affiliate of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the "Investor"). The Company formed a newly incorporated holding company, Atkore
International Group Inc. ("Atkore"), to hold the Company's Electrical and Metal Products business. On December 22, 2010, the transaction closed and the Investor acquired shares of a
newly-created class of cumulative convertible preferred stock of Atkore (the "Preferred Stock"). The Preferred Stock initially represented 51% of the outstanding capital stock (on an
as-converted basis) of Atkore. In connection with the
closing, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $713 million and recorded a gain of $259 million during the first quarter of 2011. During the year ended September 30,
2011, the Company recorded a net working capital adjustment of $11 million that reduced the gain on disposal. The gain on disposal is recorded within restructuring, asset impairment and
divestiture (gains) charges, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. Divestitures (Continued)

In
connection with the sale, the Company determined the fair value of its retained ownership interest in Atkore by implying a total equity value of Atkore using the price paid by the
Investor for the Preferred Stock less the expected present value of dividends to be paid on the Preferred Stock (the "Implied Equity Value"). The discount rate used to determine the present value of
the expected dividends was calculated by taking the average of the stated return on the Preferred Stock pursuant to the Agreement and Atkore's estimated cost of equity. The Implied Equity Value was
then allocated to the Company's retained ownership interest. To arrive at the fair value of the Company's retained ownership interest, the Company applied a discount factor to the Company's allocated
Implied Equity Value due to the lack of marketability of the common stock of Atkore, which is now privately held. The fair value of the Company's retained ownership interest was determined to be
$137 million, resulting in the Company recognizing a $49 million gain upon deconsolidation during the first quarter of fiscal 2011, which is included in the gain on sale noted above.
Tyco's retained ownership interest in Atkore is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is recorded in other assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
September 30, 2011. The Company's proportionate share of Atkore's net income (loss) is recorded within other expense, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations as the amounts
were not material. The Company recorded an equity loss of $9 million for the year ended September 30, 2011.

Fiscal

During
the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company approved a plan to sell its French security business, which was part of the Company's Tyco Security Solutions
segment. The results of operations were presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations had not been met. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company completed the
sale and recorded a $53 million pre-tax gain within restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture (gains) charges, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fiscal

During
the third quarter of 2008, the Company approved a plan to sell a business in its Tyco Security Solutions segment. This business had been classified as
held for sale in the Company's historical Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the second quarter of 2009, due to a change in strategy by management, the Company decided not to sell the business. As a
result, the business no longer satisfied the requirements to be classified as held for sale. The Company measured the business at the lower of its (i) carrying amount before it was classified
as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the business been continuously classified as held and used, or (ii) fair value at the
date the decision not to sell was made. The Company recorded a charge of $8 million in the second quarter of 2009 relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have
been recorded had the asset been continuously classified as held and used.

Discontinued Operations

Fiscal

On
September 30, 2010, the Company sold its European water business, which was part of the Company's Flow Control segment. The sale was completed for
approximately $264 million in cash

proceeds,
net of $7 million of cash divested on sale, and a pre-tax gain of $172 million was recorded, which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from
discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fiscal

During
the third quarter of 2010, the Company approved a plan to sell its European water business, which subsequently closed on September 30, 2010 as
discussed in fiscal 2011
above. During the year ended September 24, 2010, the business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was included in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Fiscal

In
July 2008, the Company substantially completed the sale of its Infrastructure Services business, which met the criteria to be presented as discontinued
operations. In order to complete the sale of the remaining Infrastructure Services businesses, Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. ("ET Brasil"), the Earth Tech UK businesses and certain assets in China,
the Company was required to obtain consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the businesses and assets. By the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company received all the necessary consents
and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the businesses and assets and received cash proceeds of $61 million. As a result of the fiscal 2009 dispositions, a net pre-tax gain
of $33 million was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 25, 2009.

During
fiscal year 2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of its Healthcare and Electronics businesses. The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates
for certain assets and liabilities related to the 2007 Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. There were $13 million
and nil of adjustments recorded through shareholders' equity during the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. During the year ended September 25, 2009,
$43 million was recorded through shareholders' equity, $9 million of which related to a pre-Separation income tax filing in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and
$34 million of other items which reflect immaterial adjustments to shareholders' equity which were recorded to correct the distribution amount at the date of the 2007 Separation.
Adjustments in the future for the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and/or TE Connectivity legal entities
and for certain amended income tax returns for the periods prior to the 2007 Separation may be recorded to either shareholders' equity or the Consolidated Statement of Operations depending on
the specific item giving rise to the adjustment.

Divestiture (Gains) Charges, Net

During 2011, 2010, 2009, the Company recorded a net gain of $230 million, a net gain of $40 million, and a net loss of

2007 and pre-2006 Programs

During fiscal 2007 and 2008, the Company launched a restructuring program across all of the Company's segments, including the corporate
organization, to streamline some of the businesses and reduce the operational footprint (the "2007 Program"). The Company maintained a restructuring reserve related to the 2007 Program of
$17 million and $26 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. The Company incurred $1 million of charges and utilized $10 million
of the restructuring reserve balance during the year ended September 30, 2011. In addition, the Company continues to maintain restructuring reserves related to certain programs initiated prior
to 2006. The total amount of these reserves was $14 million as of both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. The Company incurred $1 million of charges and utilized
$1 million of the restructuring reserve balance during the year ended September 30, 2011. The aggregate remaining reserves related to the 2007 and pre-2006 programs primarily
relate to facility exit costs for long-term non-cancelable lease obligations with expiration dates that range from 2011 to 2022 primarily within the Company's Tyco Security
Solutions segment.

Fiscal

Acquisitions

During the year ended September 30, 2011, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled
$656 million, net of cash acquired, which primarily related to the acquisitions of Oceania Capital Partners Limited's Signature Security Group ("Signature Security Group"), KEF
Holdings Ltd. ("KEF"), and Chemguard Inc. ("Chemguard"). Signature Security Group is an electronic security company operating in Australia and New Zealand primarily in small business and
residential markets. Cash paid for Signature Security Group totaled approximately $184 million, net of cash acquired of $2 million by the Company's Tyco Security Solutions segment on
April 29, 2011. On June 29, 2011 (the "KEF closing date"), the Company's Tyco Flow Control segment acquired a 75% equity interest in privately-held KEF, a vertically
integrated valve manufacturer in the Middle East for approximately $295 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the KEF acquisition
agreement, beginning the first full fiscal quarter following the third anniversary of the KEF closing date, the Company can exercise a call option and the noncontrolling interest stakeholder can
exercise a put option, which would require the Company to purchase the remaining 25% equity interest for the greater of $100 million or a multiple of KEF's average earnings before income taxes,
depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the prior twelve consecutive fiscal quarters. As the put option is redeemable at the option of the noncontrolling interest stakeholder, the remaining 25%
equity interest has been accounted for as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. See Note 20. On September 1, 2011, the Company's Fire Protection segment completed the acquisition of
Chemguard for approximately $130 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Chemguard is a provider of firefighting foam concentrates and equipment, foam systems, services and
specialty chemicals.

On
September 15, 2011, the Company agreed to acquire Visonic Ltd. ("Visonic"), a global developer and manufacturer of electronic security systems and components, for

Other expense, net of $16 million in 2011, primarily relates to our share of Atkore's net loss of $9 million, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting,
and a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $7 million. See Note 7.

Other
expense, net of $75 million in 2010, primarily related to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of our 6.375% public notes due
2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 12. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of an increase in the receivables due from
Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

Other
expense, net of $7 million in 2009, primarily related to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE
Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk
related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,400 million and $1,379 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and
recorded when the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. The Company believes
that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As
of September 30, 2011, the Company had $6,277 million of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Of these, $5,411 million
have no expiration, and the remaining $866 million will expire in future years through 2030. In the U.S., there were approximately $1,814 million of federal and $1,536 million of
state net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2011, which will expire in future years through 2030.

As
of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, Tyco had unrecognized tax benefits of $270 million and $318 million, respectively, of which
$241 million and $276 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Tyco recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expense. Tyco had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $60 million and $63 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010,
respectively. Tyco recognized $4 million, $13 million and $1 million of income tax expense for

Tax Sharing Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally
governs Covidien's, TE Connectivity's and Tyco's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the 2007 Separation with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business
taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or TE Connectivity to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal
income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored
treatment under the Code.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. Income Taxes (Continued)

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco shares responsibility for certain of its, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's income tax liabilities, which result in cash payments, based on a sharing
formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise
from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. The costs and expenses associated with the management of
these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. In connection with the execution of the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco established a net receivable from Covidien and TE
Connectivity representing the amount Tyco expected to receive for pre-Separation uncertain tax positions, including amounts owed to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). As of
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, the aggregate amount of the net receivable was $89 million and $114 million, respectively, of which
$73 million and $89 million, respectively, was included in other assets and $16 million and $25 million, respectively, was included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Tyco also established liabilities representing the fair market value of its share of Covidien's and TE Connectivity's estimated obligations, primarily to the
IRS, for their pre-Separation taxes covered by the Tax Sharing Agreement. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, Tyco had recorded $387 million and
$398 million, respectively, in other liabilities, and $49 million and $156 million, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities. During the year ended
September 30, 2011, Tyco made a net cash payment of $113 million to Covidien and TE Connectivity related to the resolution of certain IRS audit and pre-Separation tax
matters.

Tyco
assesses the shared tax liabilities and related guaranteed liabilities at each reporting period. The receivable and liability were initially recognized with an offset to
shareholders' equity in 2007. During the year ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, Tyco recorded expense of $7 million, income of
$8 million and expense of $14 million, respectively, in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement. Tyco will provide payment to Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing
Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the audit process by applicable taxing authorities is completed for the impacted years and cash payments
are made. Notwithstanding the resolution of these items, certain significant items regarding pre-Separation shared tax liabilities remain open, and given the nature of these liabilities,
the maximum amount of potential future payments under the Tax Sharing Agreement is not determinable. Such cash payments, when they occur, will reduce the guarantor liability as such payments represent
an equivalent reduction of risk. Tyco also assesses the sufficiency of the Tax Sharing Agreement guarantee liability on a quarterly basis and will increase the liability when it is probable that cash
payments expected to be made under the Tax Sharing Agreement exceed the recorded balance.

Tyco
and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised
issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 Separation. The issues and proposed adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the
sharing provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement. Tyco is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. With respect to adjustments raised by the IRS, although the Company expects
to resolve a substantial number of these adjustments, a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is
unlikely that Tyco will be able to resolve the open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period, through the IRS appeals process. As a
result, Tyco may be required to litigate these

matters.
The Company has assessed its obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, including with respect to the proposed civil fraud penalties discussed below, to determine that its recorded
liability of $436 million is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by the Company under such agreement. See Note 13. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is
uncertain and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

In
connection with the aforementioned audits, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to TE Connectivity in connection with the
2007 Separation. The penalties allegedly arise from actions of former executives taken in connection with intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on
statutory guidelines, the Company estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. This is a pre-Separation tax liability that is covered by
the provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement. Also in connection with the IRS audits described above, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company, as Audit Management Party under the Tax Sharing
Agreement, reached a settlement agreement with the IRS on certain deductions taken by Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity on pre-separation tax returns filed for the periods 2001 to 2004.
The settlement did not have a material effect to the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Notwithstanding this settlement, as mentioned above, certain significant items related to the audits of the periods from 1997 to 2004 remain open. Additionally, the Company considered the potential
impact of the settlement as part of its quarterly assessment of the guarantee liability and concluded that no adjustment to the liability was needed.

In
addition to dealing with pre 2007 Separation tax liabilities of each of the three entities party thereto, the Tax Sharing Agreement contains sharing provisions to address the
contingency that the 2007 Separation itself, or internal transactions related to the 2007 Separation, may be deemed taxable by U.S. or non U.S. taxing authorities. In the event the
2007 Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the 2007 Separation by Tyco, Covidien or TE Connectivity, the party responsible
for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on each company as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken by any of the three companies after the
2007 Separation, then Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity would be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on any of the companies as a result of such determination.
Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and TE
Connectivity are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be liable under applicable tax law for
such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share of
Tyco's, Covidien's and TE Connectivity's tax liabilities. See Note 13.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries or for unrecognized

deferred
tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, since the earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in
duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such
subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related
to investments in subsidiaries.

8. Earnings Per Share

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company adopted the authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating
securities. The Company historically issued certain restricted stock awards that vest over a period of three years which contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends and should be treated
as participating securities. These types of awards were last issued during fiscal 2006. Awards containing such rights that are unvested are considered to be participating securities and are included
in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. All of these awards were vested as of September 25, 2009. As a result, the Company was not required to
compute earnings per share for fiscal 2011 and 2010 using the two-class method unless new awards are granted. The retrospective application of this guidance did not have an impact on the
Company's historically reported earnings per share for 2009 as the effects would be anti-dilutive because the Company reported a loss from continuing operations.

10. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Fiscal 2011 and 2010 Goodwill

Annually, in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company tests goodwill for impairment by
comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for each reporting unit is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's forecast
cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital of market participants. A market approach is utilized to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each
reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired. In determining fair value, management relies on and considers a number
of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash
flow, comparable market transactions (to the extent available), other market data and the Company's overall market capitalization. There were no goodwill impairments as a result of performing the
Company's 2011 and 2010 annual impairment tests. Based on the Company's most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company determined
that its Water and Environmental Systems reporting unit within the Tyco Flow Control segment had limited recoverability of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
6.9%. As of September 30, 2011, the Water and Environmental Systems goodwill balance was $298 million. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values
of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time
to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its goodwill.

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company realigned its Safety Products segment between its ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments to create two new segments: Tyco
Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. Also, various businesses were realigned between Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. As a result of the realignment of business activities,
the balances as of September 25, 2009 have been recast. As part of the realignment the Company tested the related goodwill balances for recoverability and determined goodwill continued to be
recoverable.

Fiscal 2009 Goodwill Impairment

The Company began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in its Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire
Protection segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at its former Electrical and Metal Products segment due
to the slowdown in the non-residential construction market. Although the Company considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter
of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecast results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused
the Company to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed for certain reporting units in the above mentioned businesses. The Company determined that these events and changes in
circumstances constituted triggering events for the following six reporting units: Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") Security reporting units, Access Control and Video Systems ("ACVS"), and
Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") within the Tyco Security Solutions segment. EMEA Fire reporting units and Life Safety within the Tyco Fire Protection segment and Electrical and Metal Products
reporting unit within the Electrical and Metal Products segment. As a result of the triggering events, the Company assessed the recoverability of each of the reporting unit's long-lived
assets and



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

10. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)

concluded
that the carrying amounts were recoverable at March 27, 2009. Subsequently, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units.

To
perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the six reporting units with triggering events, the Company compared the carrying amounts of these reporting units to their
estimated fair values. Fair value for each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating
income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital of market participants. A market approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar
lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available), was used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each
reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a
number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated
future cash flow, comparable market transactions (to the extent available), other market data and the Company's overall market capitalization.

As
described above, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis for determining the fair value of each of the reporting units where triggering events had occurred. Based on the
factors described above, actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting unit's products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash
flows used in the
second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from the Company's most recent test conducted during the fourth quarter of 2008. The range of the weighted-average cost of
capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for the Company's products and services. The weighted-average cost of capital
were as follows:

Second Quarter

of 2009

Fourth Quarter

of 2008

Weighted-Average Cost of Capital

10.9% to 12.8%

10.0% to 11.7%

The
results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test indicated there was a potential impairment of goodwill in each of the six reporting units identified with triggering events,
as the carrying amounts of the reporting units exceeded their respective fair values. As a result, the Company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units. In
the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compared the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. The implied fair
values of goodwill were determined by allocating the fair values of each reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the applicable reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible
assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The results of the second step of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the
carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. The Company recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion
after-tax) which was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter ended March 27,

Fiscal 2009 Intangible Asset Impairment

The Company began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 at its Tyco Security Solutions segment due to a
slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Although the Company considered and concluded these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009,
the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecast results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused the Company
to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. This deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer business of the Tyco
Security Solutions segment resulted in a further lowering of management's projections of revenues from the retailer end market during the second quarter of 2009.

Based
on these factors and uncertainties described above, estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of the Company's Sensormatic tradename as well as franchise
rights relating to Winner and Sensormatic Security Corp ("SSC") during the second quarter of 2009 were revised downward relative to the estimates used in the Company's most recent test during the
fourth quarter of 2008. The range of the discount rates utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for the Company's products and
services. The discount rates were as follows:

Second Quarter

The
results of the impairment test indicated that the Tyco Security Solutions Sensormatic tradename and Winner and SSC franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their
respective carrying amounts. As such, the Company recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after-tax) which was recorded in
goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Specifically, the Company recorded the following

11. Related Party Transactions

The Company has amounts due related to loans and advances issued to employees in prior years under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, relocation programs and other advances made to
executives. Loans were provided to employees under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, which is now discontinued, except for outstanding loans for the payment of taxes upon the vesting of shares
granted under our Restricted Share Ownership Plans. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors and new senior management adopted a policy under which no new loans are allowed to be
granted to any officers of the Company and existing loans are not allowed to be extended or modified. There have been no loans made to any of the Company's current executives. The outstanding loans
are not collateralized and bear interest, payable annually, at a rate based on the
six-month LIBOR, calculated annually as the average of the rates in effect on the first day of each of the preceding 12 months. Loans are generally repayable in ten years; however,
earlier payments are required under certain circumstances, such as when an employee is terminated. In addition, the Company made mortgage loans to certain employees under employee relocation programs.
These loans are generally payable in 15 years and are collateralized by the underlying property. The maximum amount outstanding under these programs was $21 million as of both
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. Loans receivable under these programs, as well as other unsecured advances outstanding, were $21 million as of both September 30,
2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. The total outstanding loans receivable includes loans to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Company's former chairman and chief executive officer (until June
2002). The amount outstanding under these loans, plus accrued interest, was $28 million as of both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 and the rate of interest charged on
such loans was 0.5% in both 2011 and 2010. Interest income on these interest bearing loans was not material for all periods presented. Certain of the above loans totaling $1 million as of both
September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 are non-interest bearing.

The
Company filed civil complaints against Mr. Kozlowski and its former chief financial officer, Mark Swartz, for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to
alleged abuses of the Company's Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program, unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self-dealing transactions and other improper conduct.

In
June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related wrongful
conduct involving a $20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The payment
was purportedly made for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging the Company's acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. (the "CIT Group"). On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh pleaded
guilty to a felony violation of New York law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York County) and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the SEC in
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Both the felony charge and the civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such payment. The felony charge accused
Mr. Walsh of intentionally concealing information concerning the payment from Tyco's directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities in the State of New York. The SEC
action alleged that Mr. Walsh knew that the registration statement covering the sale of Tyco securities as part of the CIT Group acquisition contained a material misrepresentation concerning
fees payable in connection with the acquisition. Pursuant to the plea and settlement, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on December 17, 2002. In October 2010, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Tyco's affirmative claims for recovery of damages against Mr. Walsh. Tyco is pursuing an appeal. This affirmative matter, and
the affirmative matters against

During
2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as

Commercial Paper

As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), the Company's finance
subsidiary, had no commercial paper outstanding.

Credit Facilities

On March 24, 2011, TIFSA, as the Borrower, and the Company as the Guarantor, entered into a Four-Year Senior
Unsecured Credit Agreement, providing for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $750 million (the "Credit Agreement"). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement,
TIFSA and the Company terminated the existing Three-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated June 24, 2008, which provided for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate
amount of $500 million. The Credit Agreement also reduced the lenders' commitments under the existing Five-Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated April 25, 2007, from
an aggregate of $1.19 billion to $750 million, and which is scheduled to expire in April 2012.

As
a result of entering into the Credit Agreement and the termination and reduction described above, the Company's committed revolving credit facilities totaled $1.5 billion as of
September 30, 2011. These revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010, there were no amounts drawn under the Company's revolving credit facilities. Interest under the revolving credit facilities is variable and is calculated by reference to
LIBOR or an alternate base rate.

Fiscal 2011 Debt Issuance/Repayment

On January 12, 2011, TIFSA issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Notes due on January 15, 2018
(the "2018 Notes") and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Notes due on January 15, 2023 (the "2023 Notes"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.
TIFSA received total net proceeds of approximately $494 million after deducting debt issuance costs of approximately $1 million for the 2018 Notes and $2 million for the 2023
Notes, as well as debt discount of approximately $1 million for the 2018 Notes and $2 million for the 2023 Notes. The net proceeds of the aforementioned debt issuances, along with other
available funds, were used to fund the repayment upon maturity of all of the Company's outstanding 6.75% Notes due February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million. The 2018 Notes and the
2023 Notes are unsecured and rank equally with TIFSA's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

Prior
to January 15, 2018 in the case of the 2018 Notes and prior to October 15, 2022 in the case of the 2023 Notes, TIFSA may redeem any of the notes at a redemption price
equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes of such series or a make-whole amount, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. On or after October 15, 2022, TIFSA
may redeem the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of both the 2018 Notes and the 2023 Notes have the
right to require TIFSA to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the

$3 million and a debt discount of approximately $2 million. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding 6.375% notes due
October 2011. The 2015 notes are unsecured and rank equally with TIFSA's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. TIFSA may redeem any of the 2015 notes at any time by paying the greater of the
principal amount of the notes or a "make-whole" amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 2015 notes have the right to require TIFSA to repurchase all or a portion of
the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event which
requires the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the Indenture governing the notes. The debt issuance costs will be amortized from the date of issuance to the
maturity date. Interest is payable semiannually on April 15

On
May 28, 2010, the Company redeemed all of its 6.375% public notes due 2011 (the "2011 notes"), 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029, outstanding at that time, which
aggregated $878 million in principal amount. As a result of the debt redemption, the Company recorded an $87 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. The
charge is comprised of the make-whole premium, write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to the extinguished bonds and a net loss recognized upon
termination of the associated interest rate swap contracts related to the 2011 notes.

On
October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% notes due on October 15, 2014, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by

Other Debt Information

The aggregate amounts of principal debt, including capital leases, maturing during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as
follows ($ in millions): $3 in 2012, $4 in 2013, $661 in 2014, $506 in 2015, $508 in 2016 and $2,409 thereafter.

The
weighted-average interest rate on total debt was 5.9% and 6.3% as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, excluding the impact of interest rate
swaps. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt was 6.8% as of September 24, 2010. There was no public short-term debt outstanding as of
September 30, 2011. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, the Company had swapped an aggregate of approximately $1.2 billion and
$1.5 billion, respectively, of fixed for floating rate debt. The impact of the Company's interest rate swap agreements on reported interest expense was a net decrease of $22 million for
2011, a net decrease of $24 million for 2010, and a net decrease of $6 million for 2009.

In
connection with the acquisition of KEF during the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company acquired $64 million of debt which was substantially paid as of
September 30, 2011.

13. Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of
these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and
performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. Guarantees (Continued)

Sharing
Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the 2007 Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary
to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, the Company determined the fair value of these
guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present value measurement techniques. Significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes,
assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution. The probability weighted outcomes were discounted using the Company's incremental
borrowing rate. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of guarantees and indemnifications
under the Tax Sharing agreement was $436 million and $554 million on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. Of
these amounts $49 million and $156 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and the remaining amounts in other liabilities as of September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010, respectively. During 2011, the Company made a net cash payment of $113 million to Covidien and TE Connectivity related to the resolution of certain audit and
pre-Separation tax matters. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 7.

In
addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to various Covidien and TE Connectivity operating entities. In connection with the
2007 Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or TE Connectivity. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the
separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. The Company's obligations were $4 million, which were included in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, with an offset to shareholders' equity on the separation date.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 15.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
of September 30, 2011, the Company had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $724 million.

14. Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt and derivative financial instruments. The
fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated book value as of
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. The fair value of derivative financial instruments was not material to any of the periods presented. See below for the fair value of
investments and Note 12 for the fair value of debt.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, Tyco is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. The Company's objective for utilizing derivative
financial instruments is to manage these risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualified as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, the Company documented and linked the relationships between the hedging
instruments and hedged items. The Company also assessed and documented at the hedge's inception whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions were effective in offsetting changes in fair values
associated with the hedged items. These hedges did not result in any hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments recognized
currently in the Company's Statement of Operations, with the exception of net investment hedges for which changes in fair value are reported in the cumulative translation component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss to the extent the hedges are effective. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The derivative financial
instruments and impact of such changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments was not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010 or Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

14. Financial Instruments (Continued)

Foreign Currency Exposures

The Company manages foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of
forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the income statement impact
and potential variability in cash flows associated with intercompany loans and accounts receivable, accounts payable and forecasted transactions that are denominated in certain foreign currencies. As
of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, the total gross notional amount of the Company's foreign exchange contracts was $836 million and $860 million, respectively.

Effective
March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Tyco made the final dividend payment in the form of a reduction of capital in
February 2011, denominated in Swiss francs (See Note 17). The Company paid dividends in U.S. dollars, based on the exchange rate in effect shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations
in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend was approved and paid increased or decreased the U.S. dollar amount required to be paid. The
Company managed the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk.
Beginning in May 2011, the Company makes dividend payments out of contributed surplus in U.S. dollars which has eliminated the need to use currency hedges for dividend payments.

The
Company hedges its net investment in certain foreign operations through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. The objective is to minimize the exposure to changes in the
value of the foreign currency denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was $224 million and $255 million as of September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010, respectively. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts qualifying as net investment hedges are reported in cumulative translation component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss to the extent the hedges are effective. The ineffective portion of the hedge was not material to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended
September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. These contracts did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010.

Interest Rate Exposures

The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as
principal counterparties, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. Since the third quarter of 2009, TIFSA has been entering into interest rate swap transactions with the
objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixed-rate debt to variable rates. During the second quarter
of 2011, TIFSA also entered into interest rate swaps contracts to hedge $155 million notional amount of the 4.125% public notes due 2014. In these contracts, TIFSA agrees with financial
institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional
principal amount. In connection with the maturity of the 6.75% public notes during the second quarter of 2011, TIFSA settled the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2011 and
September 24, 2010, the total gross notional amount of the Company's interest rate swap contracts was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Financial Instruments (Continued)

Commodity Exposures

During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for
accounting purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Counterparty Credit Risk

The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, the
Company is exposed to losses if the derivative is in an asset position. When the fair value of a derivative instrument is an asset, the counterparty has to pay the Company to settle the contract. This
exposes the Company to credit risk. However, when the fair value of a derivative instrument is a liability, the Company has to pay the counterparty to settle the contract and therefore there is no
counterparty credit risk. Tyco has established policies and procedures to limit the potential for counterparty credit risk, including establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing
the creditworthiness of counterparties. As a matter of practice, the Company deals with major banks worldwide having long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of
A-/A3 or higher. To further reduce the risk of loss, the Company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with substantially all of its
counterparties. Master netting agreements provide protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and, in some cases, enable receivables and payables with the same counterparty to be offset on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, providing for a more meaningful balance sheet presentation of credit exposure. The Company's derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent
features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the Company or the counterparties.

The
Company's exposure to credit risk associated with its derivative instruments is measured on an individual counterparty basis, as well as by groups of counterparties that share
similar attributes. As of September 30, 2011, the Company was exposed to industry concentration with financial institutions as well as risk of loss if an individual counterparty or issuer
failed to perform its obligations under contractual terms. The maximum amount of loss that the Company would incur as of September 30, 2011 without giving consideration to the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements was approximately $60 million.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of
information used in developing fair value estimates. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. In cases where two or
more levels of inputs are used to determine fair value, a financial instrument's level is determined based on the lowest level input that is considered significant to the fair value measurement in its
entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are summarized as follows:

•

Level 1—inputs are based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities which are accessible as of the measurement date.

•

Level 2—inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations for the asset or liability that are derived principally from or



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. Financial Instruments (Continued)

corroborated
by market data for which the primary inputs are observable, including forward interest rates, yield curves, credit risk and exchange rates.

•

Level 3—inputs for the valuations are unobservable and are based on management's estimates of
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques such as option pricing models and discounted
cash flow models.

Investments

Investments primarily include cash equivalents, U.S. government obligations, U.S. government agency securities and corporate debt
securities.

When
available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities. Such investments are included in Level 1. When quoted market prices are
not readily available, pricing determinations are made based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information
and benchmark securities. These investments are included in Level 2 and consist primarily of U.S. government agency securities and corporate debt securities.

Derivative Financial Instruments

As described above, under the caption "Derivative Instruments" derivative assets and liabilities consist principally of forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The fair values for these derivative financial instruments are derived from market approach pricing models that take into account the contractual
terms and features of each instrument, forward foreign currency rates for the Company's foreign exchange contracts and yield curves for the Company's interest rate swaps existing at the end of the
period. Valuations are adjusted to reflect creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and the creditworthiness of the Company for liabilities. Such adjustments are based on observable market
evidence and are categorized as Level 2 exposures. Derivative financial instruments are not presented in the following tables as the derivative financial instruments were not material to any of
the periods presented.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following tables present the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, by level within the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the valuation.

15. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
connection with the 2007 Separation, the Company entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain legal actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2007
Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company, Covidien and TE Connectivity are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any judgments resulting from the actions
subject to the agreement, which generally relate to legacy matters that were not specific to the business operations of any of the companies. Substantially all of these legacy matters have been
resolved. Additionally, at the time of the 2007 Separation, the Company, Covidien and TE Connectivity agreed to allocate responsibility for certain legacy tax claims pursuant to the same formula under
the Tax Sharing Agreement. A number of the legacy tax claims remain outstanding. See Note 7.

Legacy Matters

During the fiscal quarter ended December 24, 2010, certain contingencies related to the previously disclosed settlement of the

Stumpf v. Tyco
International Ltd.

class action lawsuit elapsed. This matter, which was subject to the liability sharing provisions of the
Separation and Distribution Agreement with Covidien and TE Connectivity had previously received final court approval for its settlement. As a result of the lapsing of time periods for certain class
members to state a claim against the Company, the Company adjusted its remaining reserve for this and other legacy securities matters and recognized a net gain of $7 million during the quarter
ended December 24, 2010. Since June 2007, the Company has resolved substantially all of the legacy claims related to securities fraud and similar matters, with the exception of the claims
related to former management and Mr. Frank Walsh Jr., a former director, described below.

Tyco
is a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management, among which are affirmative cases brought by Tyco against Mr. Dennis L. Kozlowski, Mr. Mark
Swartz and Mr. Frank Walsh Jr. In connection with these affirmative actions, Mr. Kozlowski, through counterclaims, and
Mr. Swartz, through demand letters, are seeking an aggregate of approximately $138 million allegedly due in connection with their compensation and retention arrangements and under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA").

With
respect to Mr. Kozlowski, on December 1, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of several of the Company's affirmative
claims against him before trial, while dismissing all of Mr. Kozlowski's counterclaims for pay and benefits after 1995. With respect to Mr. Swartz, on March 3, 2011, the same
Court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment. The Court further ruled that issues related to damages will need to be resolved at trial. No trial date has been set. The Company expects
Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz to contest these decisions. As a result, the Company has and will continue to maintain the reserve recorded in its Consolidated Balance Sheet for the amounts
allegedly due under their compensation and retention arrangements and under ERISA until the appeals process is complete. Although the ultimate resolution of these matters could differ materially from
these estimates, the Company does not believe such resolution would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Tyco
has also brought an action against Mr. Walsh in connection with the damages suffered by Tyco arising from Mr. Walsh's breach of his fiduciary duties to Tyco. In
October 2010, the U.S. District



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Court
for the Southern District of New York denied Tyco's affirmative claims for recovery of damages against Mr. Walsh. Tyco is pursuing an appeal. This affirmative matter, and the affirmative
matters against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz, are not subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Separately, Mr. Walsh is pursuing a New
York state court claim against the Company asserting his entitlement to indemnification. This action is subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative
cleanup methods. As of September 30, 2011, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $38 million to $86 million. As of
September 30, 2011, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $60 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities
and $42 million is included in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company
believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos Matters

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits
based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial
products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third-parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate
defendants. While the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large
percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a result, have been dismissed by the courts. The Company's strategy has been, and continues to be, to mount a vigorous defense
aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, the Company cannot predict the
extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future. As part of the Company's strategy, it has also entered into a cost-sharing agreement with an entity from which it
acquired a business several decades ago. Under the agreement, insurance proceeds from policies that were purchased by the seller prior to its acquisition by the Company have been made available to the
Company. To the extent there is insufficient insurance for claims subject to the agreement, the parties are required to share costs, although responsibility for such excess costs gradually transitions
to the Company over the next nine to ten years. In 2022, the Company will ultimately be responsible for all excess costs if available insurance policies do not fully respond. While the Company
expects that the insurance policies it has gained access to under the agreement will be sufficient to cover any increased liability resulting from this arrangement, it cannot predict whether this will
be the case.

As
of September 30, 2011, there were approximately 4,500 lawsuits pending against the Company, its subsidiaries or entities for which the Company has assumed responsibility. Each
lawsuit typically



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

includes
several claims, and the Company has determined that there were approximately 5,600 claims outstanding as of September 30, 2011, which reflects the Company's current estimate of the
number of viable claims made against it, its affiliates or entities for which it has assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. This amount includes adjustments for claims
that are not actively being prosecuted, identify incorrect defendants or are duplicative of other actions.

Annually,
during the Company's third quarter, the Company performs an analysis with the assistance of outside counsel and other experts to update its estimated asbestos-related assets
and liabilities. Due to a high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, the Company uses multiple estimation
methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims
and defense costs is predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be
filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis. The Company has concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a
reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens. The Company's estimate of asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due
to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance
recoverable, the Company considers a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. On a quarterly basis, the Company
re-evaluates the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and records an expense as necessary to reflect changes in its estimated liability and related insurance asset. As of
September 30, 2011, the Company's estimated net liability of $82 million was recorded within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and
related defense costs of $306 million, and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of $224 million. Similarly, as of September 24, 2010, the Company's estimated net
liability of $106 million was recorded within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of $309 million, and
separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of $203 million.

The
amounts recorded by the Company for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on currently available information as well as estimates and assumptions. Key
variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year, the average cost of resolution of claims, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers,
amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the Company's insurance carriers. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later
portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect the Company's liability and cash payments for asbestos-related matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries. The Company believes that its
asbestos-related reserves as of September 30, 2011 are appropriate. However, actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions
used in the Company's calculations vary significantly from actual results.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, the Company has received and responded to various allegations and other
information that certain improper payments were made by the Company's subsidiaries and agents in recent years. For example, two subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business in Italy have been
charged, along with numerous other parties, in connection with the Milan public prosecutor's investigation into allegedly improper payments made to certain Italian entities. During the fourth quarter
of 2011, the Company's
subsidiaries were acquitted of these charges. The Company reported to the DOJ and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to these and other allegations and
its internal investigations. In 2005, the Company informed the DOJ and the SEC that it retained outside counsel to perform a Company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and
practices with respect to compliance with the FCPA, and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. The Company has and will continue to communicate
with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review and follow-up investigations, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper
conduct identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. The baseline review, which has been completed, has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco
and FCPA requirements, and in February 2010, the Company initiated discussions with the DOJ and SEC aimed at resolving these matters, which remain ongoing. Although the Company has recorded its best
estimate of potential loss related to this matter, it is possible that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the resolution of this matter, as the Company may
be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts,
including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Covidien
and TE Connectivity agreed, in connection with the 2007 Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its responses regarding these matters. Any judgment required to be
paid or settlement or other cost incurred by the Company in connection with the FCPA investigation matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution
Agreement, which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics businesses of the Company to Covidien and TE Connectivity, respectively, and provides that the Company
will retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations. Any liabilities not primarily related to a particular segment will be shared equally among the Company, Covidien and TE
Connectivity.

As
previously disclosed, in early 2007 certain former subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business were charged, prior to their divestiture, by the German Federal Cartel Office
("FCO") with engaging in anti-competitive practices, in particular with regard to its hydrant, valve, street box and fittings business. The Company investigated this matter and determined
that the conduct may have violated German competition law. The Company is cooperating with the FCO in its ongoing investigation of this violation. Following settlement discussions with the FCO, the
Company has recorded its best estimate of potential loss related to this matter. However, it is possible that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the
resolution of this matter, as the Company may be required to pay material fines, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

During
the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company has concluded that its best estimate of probable loss for these compliance matters is $34 million in the aggregate, which the
Company recorded as a liability
in accrued and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended September 30, 2011. Due to the sharing provisions in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the
Company has also recorded receivables from Covidien and TE Connectivity related to these compliance matters in other current assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
September 30, 2011.

ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic
Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund (the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the Fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan such as the Fund, the
employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between Grinnell Fire
Protection Systems, SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669.

ERISA
requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan. A plan's assessment of
withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration, and ERISA requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration. If the employer
prevails in arbitration (and any subsequent appeals), its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest. The Fund's total withdrawal liability assessment against SimplexGrinnell
is approximately $25 million. The quarterly withdrawal liability payments are $1.1 million, $18.7 million of which has been cumulatively paid through September 30, 2011.
While the ultimate outcome is uncertain, SimplexGrinnell believes that it has strong arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the Fund, and it plans to vigorously defend against the Fund's
withdrawal liability assessment. The matter is currently in arbitration. The Company has made no provision for this contingency and believes that its quarterly payments are recoverable.

Broadview Security Contingency

On May 14, 2010, the Company acquired Broadview Security, which is a business that was formerly owned by The Brink's Company.
Under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, as amended (the "Coal Act"), The Brink's Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries at July 20, 1992 (including certain legal
entities acquired in the Broadview Security acquisition) are jointly and severally liable with certain of The Brink's Company's other current and former subsidiaries for health care coverage
obligations provided for by the Coal Act. A Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Associate ("VEBA") trust has been established by The Brink's Company to pay for these liabilities, although the trust may
have insufficient funds to satisfy all future obligations. At the time of its spin-off from The Brink's Company, Broadview Security entered into an agreement in which The Brink's Company
agreed to indemnify it for any and all liabilities and expenses
related to The Brink's Company's former coal operations, including any health care coverage obligations. The Brink's Company has agreed that this indemnification survives the Company's acquisition of
Broadview Security. The Company has evaluated its potential liability under the Coal Act as a contingency in light of all known facts, including the funding of the VEBA, and indemnification provided
by The Brinks Company. The Company has concluded that no accrual is necessary due to the existence of the indemnification and its belief that The Brink's Company and VEBA will be able to satisfy all
future obligations under the Coal Act.

ADT Dealer Litigation

As previously reported, in 2002, the SEC's Division of Enforcement conducted an investigation related to past accounting practices for
dealer connect fees that ADT had charged to its authorized dealers upon purchasing customer accounts. The investigation related to accounting practices employed by the Company's former management,
which were discontinued in 2003. Although the Company settled with the SEC in 2006, a number of former dealers and related parties have filed lawsuits against the Company in the United States and in
other countries, including a class action lawsuit filed in the District Court of Arapahoe County, Colorado, alleging breach of contract and other claims related to ADT's decision to terminate certain
authorized dealers in 2002 and 2003. In February 2010, the Court granted a directed verdict in ADT's favor dismissing a number of the plaintiffs' key claims. Upon appeal, the Colorado Court of Appeals
affirmed the verdict in ADT's favor in October 2011. While it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the Colorado lawsuit or other lawsuits stemming from dealer
terminations, the Company does not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Matters

In addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and product
and general liability claims, incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. With respect to many of these claims, the Company either self-insures or maintains
insurance through third-parties, with varying deductibles. While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of any such
proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows beyond
amounts recorded for such matters.

Income Tax Matters

See Note 7 for a more detailed discussion of the status of the Company's outstanding income tax audits.

16. Retirement Plans

The Company sponsors a number of pension plans. The Company measures its pension plans as of its fiscal year end. The following disclosures exclude the impact of plans which are
immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its
U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations
which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current
participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on local regulations and the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit
plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

During
fiscal 2011, the Company froze its last remaining active U.S. pension plan. During fiscal 2010, the Company adopted plan amendments that froze pension plan benefits for certain of
its defined benefit arrangements in the United Kingdom, which resulted in the Company recognizing a curtailment gain of approximately $22 million in selling, general and administrative expenses
within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For inactive plans the Company amortizes its actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy of the pension plan participants.

The
estimated net loss and prior service cost for U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next
fiscal year are expected to be $14 million and nil, respectively.

The
estimated net loss and prior service credit for non-U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit
cost over the next fiscal year are expected to be $10 million and nil, respectively.

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by asset class, historical performance of asset classes over
long-term periods, asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions.

The
Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to maintain an adequate level of diversification
while maximizing the return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants as well as providing adequate liquidity to
meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. In addition, local regulations and local financial considerations are factors in determining the appropriate investment strategy in each
country. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40% allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for
non-U.S. pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 50% to equity securities, 47% to debt securities and 3% to other asset classes, including real estate and cash
equivalents.

Pension

Although
the Company does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management in certain commingled funds, the
plans may
indirectly hold Tyco securities. The aggregate amount of the securities would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.

The
Company evaluates its defined benefit plans' asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of risk. Types of investment concentration risks that are evaluated
include, but are not limited to, concentrations in a single entity, industry, foreign country and individual fund manager. As of September 30, 2011, there were no significant concentrations of
risk in the Company's defined benefit plan assets.

The
Company's plan assets are accounted for at fair value and are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value of assets and their placement within the fair
value hierarchy levels. The Company's asset allocations by level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30,

Equity
securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. equities. Publicly traded securities are valued at the last trade or closing price reported in the
active market in which the individual securities are traded. Certain equity securities are held within commingled funds which are valued at the unitized net asset value ("NAV") or percentage of the
net asset value as determined by the custodian of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund.

Fixed
income securities consist primarily of government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, and mortgage and other asset-backed securities. When available, fixed income
securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Government and agency securities and corporate debt securities are valued using the
most recent bid prices or occasionally the mean of the latest bid and ask prices when markets are less liquid. Asset-backed securities including mortgage backed securities are valued using
broker/dealer quotes when available. When quotes are not available, fair value is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, which incorporates other observable inputs such as cash flows,
underlying security structure and market information including interest rates and bid evaluations of comparable securities. Certain fixed income securities are held within commingled funds which are
valued unitizing NAV determined by the custodian of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund.

Real
estate investments include publicly traded real estate investment trusts ("REITS") and direct investments in commercial and residential properties. REITS are valued at the last
trade or closing price in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Direct real estate properties are valued using discounted cash flow models which consider
long-term lease estimates, future rental receipts and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on a periodic basis.

Cash
and cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term commercial paper, bonds and other cash or cash-like instruments including settlement proceeds due from
brokers, stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

The
strategy of the Company's investment managers with regard to the investments valued using NAV or its equivalent is to either match or exceed relevant benchmarks associated with the
respective asset
category. None of the investments valued using NAV or its equivalent contain any redemption restrictions or unfunded commitments.

During
2011, the Company contributed $9 million to its U.S. and $69 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, which represented the Company's minimum required
contributions to its pension plans for fiscal year 2011. The Company also made voluntary contributions of $15 million to its U.S. plans during 2011.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that it will contribute at least the minimum required to its pension plans in 2012 of $44 million for the U.S.
plans and $60 million for non-U.S. plans.

Executive Retirement Arrangements

—Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz participated in individual Executive Retirement Arrangements maintained by Tyco
(the "ERA"). Under the ERA, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz would have fixed lifetime benefits commencing at their normal retirement age of 65. The Company's accrued benefit obligations for
Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 30, 2011 were $93 million and $48 million, respectively. The Company's accrued benefit obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski
and Swartz as of September 24, 2010 were $87 million and $45 million, respectively. Retirement benefits are available at earlier ages and alternative forms of benefits can be
elected. Any such variations would be actuarially equivalent to the fixed lifetime benefit starting at age
65. Amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz under the ERA are the subject of litigation brought by the Company against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz. See Note 15.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

—The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include 401(k) matching programs, as
well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was
$82 million, $81 million and $79 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company also maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). This plan
is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to IRS limits on eligible compensation under the defined contribution plans. The expense related to the SERP was not
material for 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their
compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds
correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation liabilities were $118 million
and $108 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. Deferred compensation expense was not material for 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

acquired operations provide these benefits to

17. Shareholders' Equity

Dividends

Prior to May 2011, the Company paid dividends in the form of a return of share capital from the Company's registered share capital.
These payments were made free of Swiss withholding taxes. The Company now makes dividend payments from its contributed surplus equity position in its Swiss statutory accounts. These payments are also
made free of Swiss withholding taxes. Unlike payments made in the form of a reduction to registered share capital, which are required to be denominated in Swiss francs and converted to U.S. dollars at
the time of payment, payments from the
contributed surplus account may effectively be denominated in U.S. dollars. At the next annual general meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors intends to propose certain changes affecting the
contributed surplus account on the Swiss statutory balance sheets to comply with Swiss tax regulation.

Under
Swiss law, the authority to declare dividends is vested in the shareholders, and on March 9, 2011, the Company's shareholders approved an annual dividend on the Company's
common shares of $1.00 per share, which will be paid from contributed surplus in four installments of $0.25 per share. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of $468 million as
of March 9, 2011 and a corresponding reduction to contributed surplus. The first installment of $0.25 was paid on May 25, 2011 to shareholders of record on April 29, 2011. The
second installment of $0.25 was paid on August 24, 2011 to shareholders of record on July 29, 2011. The third installment of $0.25 will be paid on November 17, 2011 to
shareholders of record on October 28, 2011. The Company records its accrued dividend in accrued and other current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17. Shareholders' Equity (Continued)

On
March 10, 2010, the Company's shareholders approved an annual dividend on the Company's common shares of 0.90 Swiss Francs ("CHF") per share, which was paid in the form of a
return on capital in four installments of CHF 0.22, CHF 0.22, CHF 0.23 and CHF 0.23 to shareholders on record on May 14, 2010, July 30, 2010,
October 29, 2010 and January 28, 2011, respectively. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 428 million as of March 10, 2010, which
approximated $399 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. The accrued dividend was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of March 26, 2010 and as a corresponding reduction of common shares, which reduced the par value of the Company's common shares from CHF 7.60 to CHF 6.70. The
installments were paid in U.S. dollars converted from Swiss Francs at the USD/CHF exchange rate in effect shortly before the payment dates.

On
May 14, 2010, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of BHS. BHS shareholders who received Tyco common stock as consideration in the merger were included in the
first installment of dividend payments that were paid on May 26, 2010. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 32 million as of May 14, 2010, which was
approximately $28 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date.

On
March 12, 2009, the Company's shareholders approved an annual dividend on the Company's common shares of CHF 0.93 per share, which was paid in the form of a return on
capital in four installments of CHF 0.23, CHF 0.23, CHF 0.23 and CHF 0.24 on May 27, 2009, August 26, 2009, November 24, 2009 and February 24,
2010, respectively. The Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 440 million as of March 12, 2009, which approximated $377 million based on the exchange rate in effect
on that date. On the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, this amount was recorded as a reduction of common shares, which reduced the par value of the Company's common shares from
CHF 8.53 to CHF 7.60. The installments were paid in U.S. dollars converted from Swiss Francs at the USD/CHF exchange rate in effect shortly before the payment dates.

Common Stock

As of September 30, 2011, the Company's share capital amounted to CHF 3,258,632,435, or 486,363,050 registered common
shares with a par value of CHF 6.70 per share following the cancellation of 28,088,101 registered shares which had been approved at the March 9, 2011 annual general meeting. Until
March 9, 2013, the Board of Directors may increase the Company's share capital by a maximum amount of CHF 1,628,100,000 by issuing a maximum of 243,000,000 shares. In addition,
(i) the share capital of the Company may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 321,127,717 through the issue of a maximum of 47,929,510 shares through the exercise of conversion
and/or option or warrant rights granted in connection with bonds, notes or similar instruments and (ii) the share capital of the Company may be increased by an amount not exceeding
CHF 321,127,717 through the issue of a maximum of 47,929,510 shares to employees and other persons providing services to the Company. Although the Company states its par value in Swiss francs,
it continues to use the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency for preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Change in Domicile

Effective March 17, 2009, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to the Canton of Schaffhausen,
Switzerland. In connection with the Change of Domicile and pursuant to



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17. Shareholders' Equity (Continued)

the
laws of Switzerland, the par value of the Company's common shares increased from $0.80 per share to CHF 8.53 per share (or $7.21 based on the exchange rate in effect on March 17, 2009). The
Change of Domicile was approved at a special general meeting of shareholders held on March 12, 2009. The following steps occurred in connection with the Change of Domicile, which did not result
in a change to total Shareholders' Equity:

(1)

approximately
21 million shares held directly or indirectly in treasury were cancelled;

(2)

the
par value of common shares of the Company was increased from $0.80 to CHF 8.53 through an approximate 1-for-9 reverse
share split, followed by the issuance of approximately eight fully paid up shares so that the same number of shares were outstanding before and after the Change of Domicile, which reduced share
premium and increased common shares; and

(3)

the
remaining amount of share premium was eliminated with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus.

Share Repurchase Program

The Company's Board of Directors approved the $1.0 billion 2011 share repurchase program, the $1.0 billion 2010 share
repurchase program and the $1.0 billion 2008 share repurchase program, in April 2011, September 2010 and July 2008, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company
repurchased approximately 30 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion under these programs, which reduced the amount of common shares outstanding and decreased the dividends
declared on the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity as of September 30, 2011. During the year ended September 24, 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 24 million
shares for approximately $900 million under the 2008 share repurchase program, which reduced the amount of common shares outstanding and decreased the dividends declared on the Consolidated
Statement of Shareholders' Equity as of September 24, 2010. Both the 2008 and 2010 share repurchase programs were completed during the year ended September 30, 2011. As of
September 30, 2011, approximately $700 million remained outstanding under the 2011 share repurchase program. See Note 27.

18. Share Plans

Tyco share-based compensation cost recognized during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $110 million, $120 million, and $99 million, respectively, all of which is included in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements during 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $31 million,
$35 million and $25 million, respectively.

During
2004, the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") effectively replaced the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan, as
amended as of May 12, 1999 (the "LTIP I Plan") and the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan") for all awards effective on and after March 25,
2004. The 2004 Plan provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long term performance awards, restricted units, restricted shares, deferred stock
units, promissory stock and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards").

The
2004 Plan provides for a maximum of 40 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan. In addition, any
common shares that have been approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the LTIP Plans but which have not been awarded there under as of January 1, 2004, reduced by the number of
common shares related to Awards made under the LTIP Plans between January 1, 2004 and March 25, 2004, the date the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, (or which have been awarded but
will not be issued, owing to expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004) and which are no longer
available for any reason (including the termination of the LTIP Plans) will also be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. When common shares are issued pursuant to a grant of a full value Award
(restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs), the total number of common shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per common share issued. As of September 30,
2011, there were approximately 19 million shares available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

The
LTIP I Plan reserved common shares for issuance to Tyco's directors, executives and managers as share options. During 2011, there were approximately 0.6 million shares
originally reserved for issuance under this plan, that became available for future grant under the 2004 Plan due to expiration, forfeiture or cancellation. As of September 30, 2011,
0.3 million options remained outstanding which were granted under the LTIP I prior to its termination.

The
LTIP II Plan was a broad-based option plan for non-officer employees. The terms and conditions of this plan were similar to the LTIP I Plan. During 2011, there were
approximately 1.8 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan that became available for future grant under the 2004 Plan due to expiration, forfeiture or cancellation. As of
September 30, 2011, 1.0 million options remained outstanding which were granted under the LTIP II prior to its termination.

Share Options

—Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices that are equal to or greater than the closing market price of the common shares
on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four
years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Historically, the Company's practice has been to settle stock option exercises through either newly issued shares or from
shares held in treasury.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

The
grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model
inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on an analysis of historic and implied volatility measures for a set of peer companies. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of
the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues
with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary
termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual share option forfeitures. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

—The Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") was suspended indefinitely during the year ended

subsidiaries
were eligible to participate in the ESPP. Eligible employees authorized payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. The Company matched a portion of the employee
contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All shares purchased under the plan were purchased on the open market by a designated broker.

Under
the SAYE Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom were granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of
grant. Options
under the SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. The SAYE Plan provided for a maximum of 10 million common shares to
be issued. All of the shares purchased under the SAYE Plan were purchased on the open market. The SAYE Plan was approved on November 3, 1999 for a ten year period and expired according to its
terms on November 3, 2009. The International Benefits Oversight Committee has not approved any additional grants since the last annual grant on October 9, 2008 and it has not applied for
approval of a replacement for the SAYE Plan at this time.

.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted under the SAYE Plan during 2009 were $3.47. There were no options granted under the SAYE Plan during 2011 and
2010. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $0.4 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit
classified as a financing cash inflow for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was not material. As of September 30, 2011, there was no material amount of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested options granted under the SAYE Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.

Restricted Share Awards

—Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant
under the 2004 Plan. Restrictions on the award generally lapse upon normal retirement, if more than twelve months from the grant date, death or disability of the employee.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

18. Share Plans (Continued)

The
fair market value of restricted awards, both time vesting and those subject to specific performance criteria, are expensed over the period of vesting. Restricted share awards that
vest based upon passage of time generally vest over a period of four years. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's shares on the
grant date. Restricted share awards that vest dependent upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels generally vest in their entirety three years from the
grant date. The fair value of performance share awards is determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation model. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated
forfeitures.

The
Company generally grants restricted stock units. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalent units ("DEUs"). Recipients of performance
shares have no voting rights and may receive DEUs depending on the terms of the grant.

Deferred Stock Units

—Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco common shares with distribution deferred
until termination of employment or service to the Company. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the
fair value of DSUs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the
vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote and receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to receive dividend equivalent units. Conditions of vesting are determined at
the time of grant. Under the 2004 Plan, grants made to executives generally vested in equal annual installments over three years while DSUs granted to the Board of Directors were immediately vested.
The Company has granted 1 million DSUs, the majority of which were outstanding as of September 30, 2011.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of DSUs granted during 2009 was $34.09. There were no DSU awards granted during 2011 and 2010, however participants continue to

20. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

As described in Note 5, on June 29, 2011, the Company acquired a 75% ownership interest in KEF. The remaining 25% interest is held by a noncontrolling interest stakeholder.
In connection with the acquisition of KEF, Tyco and the noncontrolling interest stakeholder have a call and put arrangement, respectively, for Tyco to acquire the remaining 25% ownership interest at a
price equal to the greater of $100 million or a multiple of KEF's average EBITDA for the prior twelve consecutive fiscal quarters. The arrangement becomes exercisable beginning the first full
fiscal quarter following the third anniversary of the KEF closing date of June 29, 2011. Noncontrolling interest with redemption features, such as the arrangement described above, that are not
solely within the Company's control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value through noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries net income
(loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity
and is therefore reported in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount increased or decreased for
the noncontrolling interest's share of net income or loss or its redemption value.

The
rollforward of redeemable noncontrolling interest as of September 30, 2011 is as follows:

21. Consolidated Segment Data

Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. The Company, from time
to time, may realign businesses and management responsibility within its operating segments based on
considerations such as opportunity for market or operating synergies and/or to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development for future products and services.

During
the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company realigned its Safety Products segment between its ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments to create two new segments: Tyco
Security Solutions



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21. Consolidated Segment Data (Continued)

and
Tyco Fire Protection. Tyco Security Solutions consists of the former ADT Worldwide segment as well as the portion of the former Safety Products segment that manufactures security products
including intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection consists of the former Fire Protection Services segment as well as a number of businesses from the
former Safety Products segment including the fire suppression and life safety products businesses. In addition, various businesses were realigned between Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire
Protection.

As
a result of this realignment, as well as the sale of a majority interest in the Electrical and Metal Products business (See Note 3), the Company operates and reports financial
and operating information in the following three segments:

•

Tyco Security Solutions

designs, sells, installs, services and monitors
electronic security systems for residential, educational, commercial, governmental and industrial customers. In addition, Tyco Security Solutions designs, manufactures and sells security products
including intrusion, access control and video management systems.

•

Tyco Fire Protection

designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services
fire detection and fire suppression systems and building and life safety products for commercial, industrial and governmental customers.

•

Tyco Flow Control

designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes,
fittings, automation and controls, valve automation and heat tracing products for general process, energy and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater markets.

We
also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other.

As
a result of the realignment of these business activities the revenue and operating income for the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 have been recast.
