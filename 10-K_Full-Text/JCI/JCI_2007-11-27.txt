Item 1.    Business

General

Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") completed the spin-offs of
Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly our Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies (the "Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco
shareholders. The distribution was made on June 29, 2007, to Tyco shareholders of record on June 18, 2007, the record date. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.25 of a common share of each
of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for each Tyco common share held on the record date. As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tyco's former Healthcare and Electronics businesses are now
classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

In
connection with the Separation, we realigned our management and segment reporting structure. The segment data presented reflects the new segment structure. The Company reports
financial and operating information in the following five segments, effective March 31, 2007:

Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

•

Leading market positions and brands.

We have leading market positions in each of our segments, and a number of well
recognized brands. For example:

•

ADT Worldwide

is one of the world's largest providers of electronic security systems and services to the commercial and
residential markets (

ADT

and

Sensormatic

).

•

Fire Protection Services

is one of the world's largest providers of fire detection and fire suppression systems and services
(

SimplexGrinnell

,

Wormald

and

Mather & Platt

).

•

Flow Control

is one of the world's largest manufacturers of valves and related products
(

Keystone

and

Vanessa

).

•

Safety Products

is a major designer and manufacturer of fire suppression products
(

Ansul

and

Grinnell

), breathing apparatus for emergency workers
(

Scott

), intrusion security products (

DSC

and

Bentel

)
and video and access control products (

American Dynamics

and

Software House

).

•

Electrical and Metal Products

is a major manufacturer of galvanized steel tubing and cable products
(

Allied Tube & Conduit

and

AFC Cable

).

•

Global reach and significant scale of operations.

We are a global company, in terms of sales, manufacturing and services. We
conduct business in more than 60 countries, and 53% of our 2007 net revenue was generated outside the United States, with 29% in Europe, 16% in the Asia-Pacific region and 8% in the Other
Americas. We believe the global nature of our businesses and our extensive sales networks allow us to offer our services and products worldwide to our multinational customers, differentiating us from
our competitors, and to participate in the higher growth potential of emerging markets. In addition, we have an extensive global manufacturing presence and operate over 200 manufacturing facilities
around the world. Our global manufacturing footprint and our significant scale of operations provide us with greater flexibility to reduce our costs through manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing
power and resources for product design, marketing and customer management relative to our smaller competitors.

•

Diverse portfolio of services and products.

We offer a broad portfolio of services and products, which allows our customers
to fulfill many of their needs by purchasing solely from us. For customers that purchase multiple services or products across many geographic areas, the breadth of our offerings allows us to serve our
customers in ways that many of our competitors cannot.

•

Diverse customer base.

Our customers operate in many different industries and countries, which allows us to leverage our
skills and experience across many end markets. For example, we provide our electronic security services and products to many of the world's largest retailers, many of the leading banks in North
America and to over five million households and over one and a half million business locations globally.

•

Favorable long-term growth opportunities.

We operate businesses in a number of different markets that have
attractive characteristics and solid growth prospects. ADT Worldwide continues to experience strong growth rates due to continued commercial, residential and governmental demand for our broad range of
market leading security systems and services. We expect that growth in Fire Protection Services will be driven by non-residential construction, by refurbishment and upgrades of existing
systems and by increasingly demanding fire codes. We


also
believe that several of the industrial end markets in which Flow Control operates will achieve growth rates higher than the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. For example, we believe that the water
market will continue to grow globally due to both the increasing demand for potable water in emerging markets and the need to upgrade distribution infrastructures in mature markets. We also believe
that the oil and gas and petrochemical industries will experience increasing investment levels.

•

Stable, recurring revenue base.

Many of our ADT Worldwide customers have long-term agreements with us to provide
ongoing monitoring, inspection and maintenance services, which generate predictable annual revenue in excess of $3.5 billion. In addition, we have a substantial amount of repeatable revenue
from ongoing service and maintenance activities in our Fire Protection Services business.

•

Strong cash flow.

We historically have generated significant cash flow from our operations. Our cash flow provides us with
the financial flexibility to invest in new products and acquisitions to enhance our market leading businesses.

•

Experienced management team.

Our executive officers have the proven track record and experience necessary to execute our
business strategies. Led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen, our management team has successfully rationalized our operations, effected the spin-offs of Covidien and
Tyco Electronics, reduced our financial leverage, implemented world-class corporate governance standards and improved our financial performance. Our executive officers and the managers that support
them have extensive experience in and knowledge of the markets in which we operate and have established relationships with our customers.

Strategy

Our goal is to build upon our position as a leading provider of electronic security, fire and safety services and products, valves and controls and other
industrial products. We operate in a number of highly fragmented markets where we believe we have a number one or two market position that translates into a relatively small market share. We believe
we have opportunities to increase our market share and accelerate revenue growth by expanding our customer base and by generating new business from our existing customers. In addition, we believe we
have opportunities to improve our margins. Our business strategy includes the following strategic priorities:

•

Expand our customer base.

We believe that we have significant opportunities to attract customers and increase our market
share by focusing our sales and marketing efforts and our product development efforts on key vertical markets. These vertical markets include: retailer, banking, governmental, educational, oil and gas
and transportation for ADT Worldwide; healthcare, governmental, educational, lodging, manufacturing and commercial/industrial for Fire Protection Services; and oil, gas, power, petrochemicals and
water for Flow Control. In addition, we believe that we have significant opportunities to acquire new residential customers for ADT Worldwide, primarily by leveraging the strength of our brand and our
global presence. We also intend to aggressively pursue sales opportunities in new and emerging markets, where we believe that we have promising opportunities to expand our market share and where we
can capitalize on the skills and technologies we developed in our existing markets.

•

Generate new business from existing customers.

We believe that our customer relationships, enhanced by targeted sales and
marketing efforts that emphasize the breadth of our portfolio and that focus on product and service opportunities within each customer's industry, will enable us to increase our market penetration and
generate increased sales and service revenue from existing customers. We intend to leverage our existing customer relationships to market a broader range of our services and products to our
multinational customers. Similarly, we intend


to
identify customers that operate in limited geographic regions and that can benefit from services and products that we do not currently market in those regions. We expect to increase the global
penetration of our leading brands among our existing customers.

•

Improve productivity and efficiency.

We intend to increase the profitability of our global portfolio of services and products
by focusing on further improvements to our cost structure. We will continue to reduce our manufacturing costs by leveraging our purchasing power to reduce procurement costs, enhancing our
manufacturing productivity through an emphasis on key metrics and processes
such as Six Sigma, continuing to standardize our systems and processes across our businesses, consolidating facilities within countries and by moving our production facilities from
high-cost to low-cost manufacturing regions. During the first quarter of 2007, we launched a restructuring program across all segments, including the corporate organization,
which will streamline some of the businesses and reduce our operational footprint. We believe this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term.

In
addition, we will continue to evaluate our existing operations on a regular basis in order to identify and potentially dispose of businesses or product lines that we conclude do not meet either our
long-term return criteria or our strategic direction. For example, in July 2007, the Board of Directors approved the divestiture of Infrastructure Services, which was previously
reported as part of Corporate and Other. As a result, Infrastructure Services is reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

•

Pursue disciplined acquisition process.

Our strong cash flows will enable us to fund acquisitions that strengthen our product
offerings and market positions, as well as increase our revenues, with a particular focus on our security, flow control and safety products businesses.

History and Development

Tyco International Ltd.

Tyco International Ltd. is a Bermuda corporation. Its registered and principal office is located at Second Floor, 90 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08,
Bermuda, and its telephone number at that address is (441) 292-8674. Its management office in the United States is located at 9 Roszel Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Tyco is the
public company resulting from the business combination on July 2, 1997 of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, and ADT Limited, a Bermuda company. Effective June 29,
2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly our Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the form
of a distribution to Tyco shareholders.

Segments

See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain segment and geographic financial data relating to our business.

ADT Worldwide

Our ADT Worldwide segment designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental
customers around the world. We are one of the world's largest providers of electronic security systems and services. We have a significant market presence in North and South America, Europe and the
Asia-Pacific region. With 2007 net revenue of $7.6 billion, our ADT Worldwide segment comprises 41% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2006 and 2005, net revenue totaled
$7.2 billion or 42% of our consolidated net revenue and $7.1 billion or 43% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.


Strategy

We intend to expand our commercial customer base by focusing our sales and marketing efforts on key vertical markets such as retailer, banking, governmental,
educational, oil and gas and transportation. By adopting a vertical market-focused approach, we believe we can effectively target those market segments where ADT Worldwide can differentiate its core
capabilities and customize security solutions specific to its customers' needs. We intend to increase the number of commercial and residential customers by more effectively generating leads and by
driving productivity in our sales force through improved incentives and performance management systems. We also plan to increase our customer base by acquiring additional accounts from our network of
authorized dealers. Further, we expect to continue improving our customer account attrition rates through enhanced retention and re-sale programs, albeit at a more moderate rate than in
the past few years.

ADT
Worldwide operates in many regions including North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America. Operating performance can vary region to region for a
number of reasons, including the mix of revenues between residential and commercial customers as well as the mix of higher-margin contractual revenue vs. lower-margin product installation revenue. We
have identified certain strategic actions that we are executing to improve our operating performance in certain regions
that are currently underperforming. These actions include consolidating certain administrative functions and executing field productivity initiatives, particularly in Europe.

We
will pursue opportunities in attractive emerging markets where we believe we can leverage the skills and technologies that we have developed in the markets we currently serve. We will
complement these initiatives by continuing to work with our Safety Products segment to develop new technologies and explore potential partnerships and acquisition opportunities that will allow ADT
Worldwide to strengthen its service offerings, enhance its market positions or expand into higher-growth, adjacent markets.

Services and Products

ADT Worldwide supplies and installs electronic security systems to the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental markets. A significant portion of the
mechanical components used in our electronic security systems are manufactured by our Safety Products segment. We also provide electronic security services, including monitoring of burglar alarms,
fire alarms and other life safety conditions as well as maintaining electronic security systems.

Our
electronic security systems business involves the installation and use of security systems designed to detect intrusion, control access and react to movement, fire, smoke, flooding,
environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These electronic security systems comprise detection devices that are connected to a monitoring center that receives and records alarm
signals. For most systems, control panels identify the nature of the alarm and the areas where a sensor was triggered. Our electronic security systems include: access control systems for sensitive
areas such as offices or banks; video surveillance systems, designed to deter theft and fraud and help protect employees and customers; and asset protection and security management systems, designed
to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary electronic data. Our electronic security systems also include anti-theft systems utilizing labels and tags in the retail
industry. Many of the world's leading retailers use our Sensormatic anti-theft systems to protect against shoplifting and employee theft.

Purchasers
of our intrusion security systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. Systems installed at
customers' premises may be owned by us or by our customers. Monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local fire or police departments, notifying the
customer or taking other appropriate action. In some instances, alarm systems may be connected directly to local fire or police departments.


Our
customers often are prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that
a system be installed as a condition of coverage.

Customers

ADT Worldwide sells to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Our residential customers typically include owners of single-family homes
or multi-family apartment complexes. Our commercial customers include among others retail businesses, financial institutions, commercial/industrial facilities and health care facilities. Our
governmental customers include federal, state and local governments, defense installations, schools and mass transportation providers. In addition to advertising, direct mailings and the internet, we
market our electronic security systems and services to these customers through a direct sales force and, with respect to certain residential customers, through an authorized dealer network. A separate
sales force services large commercial and governmental customers and focuses on key vertical markets such as retailer and banking.

Competition

The electronic security services business is highly competitive and fragmented with a number of major firms and thousands of smaller regional and local companies.
Competition is based primarily on price in relation to quality of service. Rather than compete purely on price, we emphasize the quality of our electronic security service, the reputation of our
brands and our knowledge of our customers' security needs.

Fire Protection Services

Our Fire Protection Services segment designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems. We believe we are one of the largest
providers of these systems and services, with 2007 net revenue of $3.5 billion. Our Fire Protection Services segment comprises 19% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2006 and 2005, net revenue
totaled $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, which represents 19% of our consolidated net revenue in both years.

Strategy

We intend to grow our customer base and deepen our market penetration by focusing our sales and marketing efforts across global accounts and along key vertical
markets, such as healthcare, governmental, educational, lodging, manufacturing and commercial/industrial. By combining this vertical market approach with increased focus on the delivery and
responsiveness of our service offerings, we believe we can differentiate our offerings to better serve our customers' needs. We also plan to aggressively pursue recurring revenue opportunities with
existing customers. We intend to expand our product offerings in high-growth, emerging markets where we believe we can capitalize on the skills and technologies that we have developed in
our existing markets. By working closely with our Safety Products segment, we intend to develop offerings that address key technologies driving customer demand, such as mass notification, as well as
new business generated from changes and expansions in fire and life-safety codes and standards. We will continue to promote operational excellence by standardizing internal processes
across business units and consolidating back office capabilities.

Services and Products

We design, sell, install and service fire alarm and fire detection systems, automatic fire sprinkler systems and special hazard suppression systems. Fire
Protection Services operates under various leading trade names, including SimplexGrinnell, Wormald, Mather & Platt, Total Walther, Dong Bang, Zettler and Tyco. A significant portion of the
mechanical components used in our fire detection systems are manufactured by our Safety Products segment.


We offer a wide range of fire alarm and fire detection systems. These alarm and detection systems include fire alarm control panels, advanced fire alarm monitoring systems, smoke, heat
and carbon monoxide detectors, voice evacuation systems and emergency lighting systems. We also offer a wide range of fire suppression systems, the majority which are water-based sprinkler systems. In
addition, we provide custom designed special hazard suppression systems, which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases, in addition to spill control
products designed to absorb, neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous materials. These systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in certain manufacturing, power generation,
petrochemical, offshore oil exploration, transportation, data processing, telecommunications, commercial food preparation, mining and marine applications.

We
install fire detection and fire suppression systems in both new and existing buildings. These systems typically are purchased by owners, construction engineers and mechanical or
general contractors. In recent years, retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems, especially in
hotels, healthcare facilities and educational establishments. We continue to focus on system maintenance and inspection, which have become increasingly significant parts of our business.

Customers

Fire Protection Services' customers include commercial enterprises, governmental entities, airports, commercial shipping companies, fire departments,
transportation systems, owners of petrochemical facilities and homeowners. We market our fire detection and fire suppression systems to the majority of these customers through a direct sales force.

Competition

Competition in the fire detection and fire suppression business varies by region. In North America, we compete with hundreds of smaller contractors on a regional
or local basis for the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems. In Europe, we compete with many regional or local contractors on a country-by-country basis.
In Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we compete with a few large fire detection and fire suppression contractors, as well as with many smaller regional and local companies. We compete for fire
detection and fire suppression systems contracts primarily on the basis of price, service and quality.

Flow Control

Our Flow Control segment designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for the water and
wastewater markets, the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries. The global flow control market is highly fragmented, consisting of many local and regional companies
and a few global competitors. We believe we are the world's leading manufacturer of flow control products. We believe our market share in the global water, process, and energy-related markets is
approximately 5%. With 2007 net revenue of $3.8 billion, our Flow Control segment comprises 20% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2006 and 2005, net revenue totaled $3.1 billion or 18%
of our consolidated net revenue and $2.8 billion or 17% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.

Strategy

We intend to further align with our customers' needs by focusing our sales and marketing resources along key vertical markets, including water and wastewater, oil
and gas, food processing and general industrial. We plan to continue expanding our product offerings through increased R&D investments in developing technologies, as well as through selective
acquisitions and partnerships. By


continuing
to invest in our service and repair capabilities, we expect to capitalize on strong industry demand for parts and after-market services in our recurring revenue business. We intend to
leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and our geographic capabilities to enhance our ability to meet customer requirements for global projects. We intend to capitalize on growth opportunities
in key emerging markets by accelerating our investment in sales and marketing. We also intend to focus on improving profitability through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint and product
offerings.

Services and Products

Flow Control designs and manufactures a wide variety of valves, actuators, controls, pipes, fittings and heat tracing products. Valve products include a broad
range of industrial valves, including on-off valves, safety relief valves and other specialty valves. Actuation products include pneumatic, hydraulic and electric actuators. Control

a global company with 40% of sales in Europe and the Middle East, 25% from the Americas, 22% from the Pacific region and 13% from Asia.

Competition

The flow control industry is highly fragmented. We compete against a number of international, national and local manufacturers of industrial valves as well as
against specialized manufacturers on the basis of product capability, product quality, breadth of product line, delivery and price. Our major competitors vary by region.

Safety Products

Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including fire suppression products, breathing apparatus,
intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by


ADT
Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. We are a major provider of safety products, including fire suppression, breathing apparatus, video and access control and intrusion security products. With
2007 net revenue of $1.8 billion, our Safety Products segment comprises 9% of our consolidated net revenue. In both 2006 and 2005, net revenue totaled $1.7 billion or 10% of our
consolidated net revenue.

Strategy

We intend to accelerate our revenue growth by implementing the following strategies: leveraging our product development pipeline, which features enhancements and
newer technologies in Internet Protocol, integrated access control, intrusion solutions and new fire suppression technologies; expanding our presence in emerging markets, such as China, Eastern Europe
and India; and pursuing strategic partnerships and acquisitions in key product areas. We intend to improve our recurring revenue stream by further integrating our product portfolio with logical
security systems and communications services, as well as by enhancing the inter-operability of our intrusion security, access control, video systems and fire detection products. We plan to improve our
profitability by continuing to move our manufacturing footprint to low-cost countries and by driving operational excellence and strategic sourcing initiatives.

Services and Products

We manufacture fire suppression products, including water sprinkler systems, portable fire extinguishers, commercial suppression systems for special hazards

specialty products manufacturing companies based in the United States, with other smaller competitors in Europe and Asia.

Electrical and Metal Products

Our Electrical and Metal Products segment designs, manufactures and sells galvanized steel tubing and pipe products, as well as cable products, including
pre-wired electrical cables, and electrical support and metal framing systems. In North America, our Allied Tube & Conduit business is a leading manufacturer of electrical steel
conduit, and our AFC Cable Systems division is a leading manufacturer of steel and aluminum pre-wired electrical cable. Electrical and Metal Products also manufactures and sells steel
tubes, tiles, plates and other specialty formed steel products in Brazil. With 2007 net revenue of $2.0 billion, our Electrical and Metal Products segment comprises 11% of our consolidated net
revenue. In 2006 and 2005, net revenue totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, which represents 11% of our consolidated net revenue in both years.

The
market prices of key raw materials such as steel and copper have a significant impact on the segment's operating results. The segment's operating margins are significantly affected
by steel and copper spreads which are the difference between what the company paid for these raw materials and the selling price charged to customers for the range of products manufactured from these
raw materials.

Strategy

We intend to maintain our market position in key end markets by continuing to take advantage of our low-cost manufacturing base, technical leadership
and brand recognition. We also plan to increase our product offerings to address opportunities in specific industries, such as comprehensive metal framing solutions for the non-residential
construction industry. In our tubular products business, we intend to diversify into new OEM markets and offer complementary products in our existing markets.

Services and Products

Electrical and Metal Products designs and manufactures galvanized steel tubing and pipe products that include electrical conduit, fire sprinkler pipe, light gauge
steel tube, fence pipe and automotive tubular components. These steel tube and pipe products are sold under the brand names Allied Tube & Conduit, Century Tube and Tectron Tube.

We
also design and manufacture cable products including pre-wired armored and metal-clad electrical cable as well as flexible and non-metallic
conduit. These cable products are sold under the brand names AFC Cable Systems, Eastern Wire and Kaf-Tech. In addition, we manufacture various electrical support system products including
strut channel and cable tray systems and associated fittings, sold under the brand names Unistrut and TJ Cope.

Customers

The majority of the products manufactured by Electrical and Metal Products are used by trade contractors in the construction and modernization of
non-residential structures such as commercial office buildings, institutional facilities, manufacturing plants and warehouses, shopping centers and multi-family dwellings. Nearly 90% of
these products are sold through wholesale distribution to trade contractors; the remaining 10% of sales are sold to smaller contractors and homeowners through home improvement retailers.


The other major customer segment, representing approximately 25% of revenue, is the OEM market. Steel tubing supplied by Electrical and Metal Products is ultimately used as a component
for OEM products in automotive, commercial or industrial end markets. Steel tubular products are sold direct to OEMs or, in the case of automotive components, to suppliers.

Competition

The market for electrical conduit and wiring and supports, fire protection and security products and steel tubing includes a broad range of competitors. Our
principal competitors range from national manufacturers to smaller regional players. Our customers purchase from us because of the quality and breadth of our product line and the availability of our
products.

Foreign
suppliers, especially those in China, Turkey and India, also aggressively pursue the sprinkler pipe and fence pipe market through their standard pipe offerings.

Backlog

See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information relating to our backlog.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological
innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, in an effort to develop
an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to: electronic security systems; fire detection systems; suppression systems; fire extinguishers and related products; integrated
systems for surveillance and control of public transportation and other public works; fire protection sprinklers and related systems and products; structural and electrical tubing and conduit;
building structural members, panels and related fixtures; concrete reinforcing products; fire-rated and armored electrical cabling; heat tracing and floor heating systems; security wire
and fencing; and flow control products, including valves, actuators and controllers and airflow control and sensing products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various
patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our
overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Research and Development

We are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of our
existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate. We continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business
for possible investment or acquisition. Our research and development expense was $121 million in 2007, $112 million in 2006, and $113 million in 2005.

Raw and Other Purchased Materials

We are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including gas. Certain of the components used in the Fire Protection Services business, principally certain
valves and fittings, are purchased for


installation
in fire protection systems or for distribution. Materials are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. There have been no shortages in materials which have
had a material adverse effect on our businesses. However, significant increases in certain raw material costs may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins. We enter into
long-term supply contracts, using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions.

Governmental Regulation and Supervision

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local consumer protection, licensing and other laws and regulations. Most states in which we operate have
licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. Our ADT Worldwide business currently relies primarily upon the use of wireline telephone service to communicate
signals. Wireline telephone companies in the United States are regulated by both the federal and state governments.

We
conduct our businesses through subsidiaries worldwide. Changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of fire
safety codes can impact our Fire Protection Services business.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things, the generation,
storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. The cost of compliance with
environmental laws, however, has not had, and based on current information and applicable laws, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a
number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost
of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental
contamination resulting from past operations.

Given
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods, the ultimate cost of cleanup at
disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial
costs in the range of approximately $36 million to $63 million. As of September 28, 2007, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $40 million,
of which $11 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $29 million is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of September 28, 2007, we employed approximately 118,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 45,000 are employed in the United States and 73,000
are outside the United States. We have collective bargaining agreements with labor unions covering approximately 17,000 employees and believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally
good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are
not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions,
geopolitical events, climate change and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our
liquidity.

Risks Relating to Our Businesses

Cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our operating results can be adversely affected by the general cyclical pattern of certain industries in which we operate. For example, demand for our services
and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial construction, the amount of discretionary consumer and business spending and the performance of the housing market, each of which
historically has displayed significant cyclicality. A downturn in any of these industries or the deterioration in general global economic conditions could have a negative impact on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:

•

the
generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions
or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the
health and safety of our employees.

There
can be no assurances that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at


properties
at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to
the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.

We
have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where we and others
disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and /or for
natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.
These projects relate to a variety of activities, including:

•

solvent,
metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and

•

oil
spill equipment upgrades and replacement.

These
projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us.

The
ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial
costs of approximately $40 million, of which $11 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $29 million is included in other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures
to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising
from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or that we will
not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.

We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.

Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill, intangibles and other
long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating
results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. We assessed the recoverability of goodwill upon
the realignment of our business in connection with the Separation, which resulted in a $46 million charge for goodwill. Future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported
earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We are named as a defendant in a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In the ordinary course of business, we are named as a defendant in a significant amount of litigation, including claims for damages arising out of the use or
installation of our products, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior, product liability litigation, employee
matters and commercial disputes. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may
divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to
injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect


on
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss
exposures.

Some
of the lawsuits outstanding against us relate to actions taken by our former senior corporate management. On May 14, 2007, we entered into a proposed settlement with respect
to most of the class actions and deposited $2.975 billion into an escrow accounts pending final settlement of such class actions. We do not believe that it is feasible to predict or determine
the final outcome or resolution of the unresolved proceedings. A failure to consummate the proposed settlement on the agreed terms or an adverse outcome from the unresolved proceedings or liabilities
or other proceedings could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition, we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations. The nature of the services we provide potentially exposes us to risks of liability for
employee acts or omissions or system failures. In an attempt to reduce this risk, our alarm monitoring agreements contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances. We cannot assure you,
however, that these limitations will be enforced. Losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our ADT business may experience higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring
customers, increasing our depreciation and amortization expense.

Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 12.3%, 14.2% and 15.0% on a trailing 12-month basis as of September 28, 2007,
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. Although rates have decreased, if attrition rates were to trend upward, ADT's recurring revenue and results of operations will be
adversely affected. Tyco amortizes the costs of ADT's contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the ADT dealer program based on the estimated life of the customer relationships.
Internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated. If the attrition rates were to rise Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber
system assets and intangible assets, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.

Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth
rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; develop and maintain competitive products; enhance our
products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors; and develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively.
Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert
resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as
fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we anticipate. For example, on February 18, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission will
allow its mandate to wireless cellular carriers requiring them to maintain analog cellular service to expire. As a result, we expect the cellular communicators in certain of our security systems to
become obsolete. We have begun the process of upgrading the affected devices to digital technology, which has resulted in additional expenses in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we expect to incur
additional expenses in the future. If we fail to complete this upgrade, it could result in the loss of customers. Moreover, the failure of our technology or products to gain market acceptance or their
obsolescence could


significantly
reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our failure to satisfy International Trade Compliance regulations may adversely affect us.

Tyco's global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. From time to time, Tyco obtains or
receives information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports. Tyco's policy mandates strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. When Tyco receives
information alleging improper activity, its policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, reporting its findings to relevant governmental authorities.
Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from acts by our employees that would violate U.S. and/or foreign laws. Such improper actions could
subject the Company to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and,
therefore, our ability to do business.

We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from
making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in
many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs
and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these
laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants, including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all
commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities
and our other indebtedness. Acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations. See "Liquidity
and Capital Resources—Capitalization".

Changes in legislation or governmental regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We operate in regulated industries. Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and local governmental agencies with respect to
safety of operations and equipment, labor and employment matters and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the United States are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities, and
our international operations are regulated by


the
countries in which they operate. We and our employees are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations, including
many related to consumer protection. Most states in which we operate have licensing laws covering the monitored security services industry and the construction industry. Our business relies heavily
upon wireline telephone service to communicate signals, and wireline telephone companies are regulated by both the federal and state governments. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to
change the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or
revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations changed or we failed to comply, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely
affected.

Legislative and other measures that may be taken by U.S. governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions, results of operations
or cash flows.

We continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals, and modifications to existing tax treaties between the United States and
foreign countries, that could result in a material increase in our U.S. federal and state taxes. In October 2004, the U.S. Congress enacted
legislation affecting the tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions. Such legislation did not, however, retroactively apply to the 1997
acquisition of Tyco International Ltd. by ADT Limited. More recently, several proposals have been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that, if ultimately enacted by the U.S.
Congress, would have limited treaty benefits on certain payments made by our U.S. subsidiaries to non-U.S. affiliates. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties, the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on Tyco, including
increasing our tax burden, increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We could face product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install. These claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability.

We face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event that any of our
products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products, which could result in significant unexpected costs. Any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms
acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We have significant foreign operations, which are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries.

We have significant operations outside of the United States. We currently operate in approximately 60 countries. We generated 53% of our net revenue outside of
the United States in 2007. We expect net revenue generated outside of the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenue. Business operations outside of the United
States are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries, such as:

•

the
difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems;

•

trade
protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•

difficulty
in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;


•

compliance
with a variety of foreign laws and regulations;

•

changes
in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;

•

the
threat of nationalization and expropriation;

•

increased
costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions;

•

changes
in enacted tax laws;

•

limitations
on repatriation of earnings; and

•

fluctuations
in equity and revenues due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Changes
in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

Volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition, result of operations or cash flows.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. See Part II
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our
net revenue derived from sales in non-U.S. markets for 2007 was 53% of our total net revenue, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to
represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the foreign countries where we sell our products, our U.S. dollar
reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances, may have a significant effect on our results of operations. Our financial
statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars, our functional currency.

We
are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including gas, the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Volatility in the prices of these commodities
could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We
monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we purchase hedges or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations
from these fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, or if our
manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may suffer.

We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these
items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material
or manufacturing costs may increase. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall
short of our production requirements. Any of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely
affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. For example, in July 2007, the Board of
Directors approved for divestiture Infrastructure Services. Any divestiture could result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of
operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. We cannot
assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line.

We have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis.

In connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a
material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes as of September 29, 2006. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material
weakness, see "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" under Item 9A, "Controls and Procedures."

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have determined that further improvements are required in our tax
accounting processes before we can consider the material weakness remediated. Management's procedures and testing identified errors that, although not material to the consolidated financial
statements, led management to conclude that control deficiencies exist related to tax effecting consolidating entries, analysis and reconciliation of taxes receivable and taxes payable in
non-U.S. jurisdictions, certain aspects of deferred taxes, and procedures with respect to classification of tax amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. As a result of these
deficiencies, it is reasonably possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not have prevented or detected errors from occurring that could have been material, either individually or
in the aggregate.

A
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. While considerable actions
have been taken to improve our internal controls in response to the identified material weakness related to certain aspects of accounting for income taxes, and further action steps to strengthen
controls have been taken, additional work continues to address and remediate the identified material weakness. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, we may not be
able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to report financial
information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and the New York
Stock Exchange, including a delisting from the New York Stock Exchange, securities litigation, debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals, any one of which could adversely affect the
valuation of our common stock and could adversely affect our business prospects.


Risks Relating to Actions of Tyco's Former Senior Corporate Management

Pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.

As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of our former senior corporate management, former members of our Board
of Directors and our former General Counsel are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of certain disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco,
certain of our current and former employees, some members of our former senior corporate management and some former members of our Board of Directors also are named as defendants in several ERISA
class actions. On May 14, 2007, we entered into a proposed settlement with respect to most of the class actions and deposited $2.975 billion into an escrow account pending final
settlement of such class actions.

We
generally are obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are also named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent
required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are
unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any
insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, we cannot estimate the amount of loss
or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of all of these matters or from a failure to consummate the proposed settlement on the agreed terms.

Continued scrutiny resulting from ongoing governmental investigations may have an adverse effect on our business.

We and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the U.S. Department of Labor, state departments of labor, the General Service
Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. Certain
current and former employees in ADT Worldwide received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to discontinued accounting practices regarding ADT dealer connect
fees. The U.S. Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of our benefit plans. Similarly, several of our businesses periodically are the subject of state or local
government wage and hour investigations. At this time, we cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible
that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with governmental instrumentalities, which in turn could negatively
impact our business with non-governmental customers, or suffer other penalties or adverse impacts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict
whether the effects and results of these or other investigations will have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities,
including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax
contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision, equity or goodwill, as appropriate. The calculation of
our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities
and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent


to
which, additional income taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. Due
to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, however, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.

In
2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the 1997 through 2000 years, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax
returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during 2006, the Company developed proposed
amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. The Company has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to
2002, which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002. When the Company's tax return positions are updated additional adjustments may be
identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that
any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.

We estimate that our available cash, our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our revolving lines of credit will be adequate to fund our
operations and service our debt for the
foreseeable future. In making this estimate, we have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with pending litigation or investigations. Any material adverse legal judgments,
fines, penalties or settlements arising from our pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide
assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

Such
an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

require
us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, including debt reduction or dividend payments;

•

increase
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict
our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;

•

make
it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and

•

increase
the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.

Additional negative publicity may adversely affect our business.

As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco was the subject of negative publicity focusing on these actions. This negative
publicity contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities in 2002 and brought increased regulatory scrutiny upon us. Additional negative publicity related to former
senior corporate management's actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows and the market price of our publicly traded securities.


Our senior corporate management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management.

As a result of the actions of prior management, we replaced our senior corporate executives with a new team during 2002 through 2004, and a new Board of Directors
was elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2003. We cannot provide assurance that the distractions related to matters arising from the actions of prior management will
not adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Risks Relating to the Separations

If the distribution of Covidien and Tyco Electronics common shares to our shareholders or certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the Separation are determined to be taxable for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

We have received private letter rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution of Covidien
and Tyco Electronics common shares
to our shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution of such shares, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, will qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and
368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation would qualify for favorable
treatment under the Code. In addition to obtaining the private letter rulings, we have obtained opinions from the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP confirming the tax-free
status of the distribution and certain internal transactions. The private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from
Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the Internal
Revenue Service could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions,
representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset
ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Covidien and Tyco
Electronics common shares distributed to our shareholders on June 29, 2007 over our tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax. However, we would incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the Separation
should be treated as taxable transactions.

In
addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement that we have entered into with Covidien and Tyco Electronics in connection with the Separation, in the event the distribution or
the internal transactions are determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party responsible for such
failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco,
Covidien or Tyco Electronics, then we, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on us, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result of
such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. In the event that any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as
a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party's obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such
other party's taxes.


We continue to be responsible for a portion of our contingent and other corporate liabilities following the Separation, primarily those relating to shareholder litigation.

Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Covidien and Tyco
Electronics have agreed to assume and be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of certain of our contingent and other corporate
liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities will be shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate
liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation and any actions with respect to the separation plan or the Separation brought by any third party. Contingent and other corporate
liabilities do not include liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies, which are allocated 100% to the relevant company.

If
any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to
pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our
agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities including associated costs and expenses.

Many
lawsuits are outstanding against Tyco, some of which relate to actions taken by its former senior corporate management. On May 14, 2007, we entered into a proposed settlement
with respect to most of the class actions. We do not believe that it is feasible to predict the final outcome or resolution of the unresolved proceedings. Although we will share any costs and expenses
arising out of this litigation with Covidien and Tyco Electronics, a failure to consummate the proposed settlement on the agreed terms or an adverse outcome from the unresolved proceedings or
liabilities or other proceedings for which we will assume joint and several liability under the Separation and Distribution Agreement could be material with respect to our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows in any given reporting period.

We share responsibility for certain of our, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share responsibility for certain of our, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula
for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from
adjustments made by tax authorities to our, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany
transactions or similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation. All costs and expenses associated with the management of
these shared tax liabilities will be shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In
addition, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such
liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Covidien's
and Tyco Electronics' tax liabilities.


We might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the Separation because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements for
tax-free distributions.

Our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after Separation in order to preserve for U.S. federal income tax purposes
the tax-free nature of the distribution. In addition, similar limitations and restrictions will apply to Covidien and Tyco Electronics. The distribution of common shares of Covidien and
Tyco Electronics to our shareholders may result in corporate level taxable gain to us under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of our common shares, Covidien's common
shares or Tyco Electronics' common shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. For this purpose, any acquisitions or issuances of
our common shares within two years before the distribution, and any acquisitions or issuances of our common shares, Covidien's common shares or Tyco Electronics' common shares within two years after
the distribution, generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we, Covidien or Tyco Electronics may be able to rebut that presumption. We are not aware of any such acquisitions or
issuances of our common shares within the two years before the distribution. If an acquisition or issuance of our common shares, Covidien's common shares or Tyco Electronics' common shares triggers
the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, we would recognize taxable gain as described above, but such gain generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, certain
subsidiaries of Covidien or Tyco Electronics or subsidiaries of ours would incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities as a result of the application of Section 355(e) of the Code.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, there are restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with
the Separation to fail to qualify as tax-free or tax-favored transactions, as the case maybe, including entering into, approving or allowing any transaction that results in a
change in ownership of more than 35% of our common shares, a redemption of equity securities, a sale or other disposition of a substantial portion of our assets, an acquisition of a business or assets
with equity securities to the extent one or more persons would acquire 35% or more of our common shares, or engaging in certain internal transactions. These restrictions apply for the
two-year period after the distributions, unless we obtain the consent of the other parties or we obtain a private letter ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm that such action will not cause the distribution or the internal transactions undertaken in connection with
the Separation to fail to qualify as tax-favored transactions and such letter ruling or opinion, as the case may be, is acceptable to the parties. Covidien and Tyco Electronics are subject
to similar restrictions under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Moreover, the Tax Sharing Agreement generally provides that a party thereto is responsible for any taxes imposed on any other party thereto as
a result of the failure of the distribution or certain internal transactions to qualify as tax-favored transactions under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain
post-distribution actions taken by or in respect of the responsible party or its shareholders, regardless of whether the actions occur more than two years after the distribution, the other
parties consent to such actions or the responsible party obtains a favorable letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel as described above. For example, we would be responsible for a third party's
acquisition of us at a time and in a manner that would cause such failure. These restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions which might be advantageous to our shareholders and
noteholders.


Continuing demands on our management team as a result of the Separation could distract management's attention from operating the business.

The complexity of the Separation has required and will continue to require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must
devote continued time and attention to fulfilling Tyco's obligations under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement, including the defense and settlement of litigation
related to shared contingent and other corporate liabilities of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics and the administration of the U.S. tax audit for periods up to June 29, 2007. At the same
time, our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve reductions in corporate expense following the Separation. These and related demands on
our administrative resources may distract management from the day-to-day operation of Tyco's business. As a result our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
may be adversely affected.

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect will be achieved from the Separation.

We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect will result from the separation of two of Tyco's segments into independent
companies or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. For example, there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will regard Tyco's post-Separation corporate structure
as more clear and simple than its pre-Separation corporate structure or place a greater value on the businesses remaining with Tyco post-Separation than they placed on those
businesses pre-Separation.

Risks Related to Corporate Governance

We are subject to governmental investigations that might have serious consequences.

We are now, and believe that in light of the current U.S. governmental contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more U.S.
governmental investigations. If we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any U.S. governmental investigations, including violation of certain environmental or export
laws, we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. governmental contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to
fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. Any contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the U.S. government. The U.S. government also reserves the right to prohibit a
contractor from receiving new governmental contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. Independently, failure to comply with U.S. laws and regulations related to the export
of goods and technology outside the United States could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges.

Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislation and negative publicity regarding Bermuda companies could affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Legislation Relating to Government Contracts

We continue to assess the potential impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their corporate location abroad. The legislative proposals could cover the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited (a public company that
had been located in Bermuda since the 1980's with origins dating back to the United Kingdom since the early 1900's), as a result of which ADT changed its name to Tyco International Ltd. and
became the parent to the Tyco group.


We
are unable to predict the likelihood or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future
legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.

Negative Publicity

There is continuing negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, U.S. companies' use of, or relocation to, offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. As a
Bermuda company, this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or governmental agencies decline to do business with us as a result of
any perceived negative public image of Bermuda companies or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a Bermuda company.

Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Bermuda. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Bermuda based on the
civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts
obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.
We have been advised that the United States and Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore,
a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not
automatically be enforceable in Bermuda.

As
a Bermuda company, Tyco is governed by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, which differs in some material respects from laws applicable to U.S. companies and shareholders, including,
among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are
generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies do not generally have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may only exercise such rights of
action on behalf of the company in limited circumstances. Under Bermuda law, a company may also agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability, not involving fraud or dishonesty,
incurred in relation to the company.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2. Properties

Our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world aggregating approximately 39 million square feet of floor space, of which approximately
16 million square feet are owned and approximately 23 million square feet are leased. These facilities house manufacturing, distribution and warehousing operations, as well as sales and
marketing, engineering and administrative offices.

ADT
Worldwide operates through a network of offices located in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and South
Africa. Our ADT Worldwide manufacturing facilities are located in North America, and Europe. The group occupies approximately 6 million square feet, of which 1 million square feet are
owned and 5 million square feet are leased.


Fire
Protection Services operates through a network of offices located in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Our Fire
Protection Services manufacturing facilities are located in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The group occupies approximately 6 million square feet, of which
1 million square feet are owned and 5 million square feet are leased.

Flow
Control has manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers throughout North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. The group
occupies approximately 12 million square feet, of which 6 million square feet are owned and 6 million square feet are leased.

Safety
Products operates through a network of offices located in North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Our Safety Products manufacturing
facilities are

and Metal Products has manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers throughout North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The group occupies approximately 7 million square feet, of which 5 million square feet are owned and 2 million square feet are leased.

In
the opinion of management, our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing
leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. See Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our lease obligations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters, environmental matters, employment
disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of
business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party's patent were to be determined against us, we might be
required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or
licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be
significant in amount.

In
connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain class actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. A description of the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement
regarding these class actions can be found in Tyco's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on July 6, 2007.

Securities Class Actions

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco and certain of our former directors and officers have been named as defendants in over 40 purported
securities class action suits. We stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that each party to the Separation and Distribution Agreement would be primarily liable for a portion of the obligations arising
from such litigation. The stipulation also


provides
that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties would be jointly and severally liable for those obligations. Most of the securities class actions have now been transferred to
the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. On January 28, 2003, a
consolidated securities class action complaint was filed in these proceedings. On January 7, 2005, the Company answered the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint. On January 14, 2005, lead
plaintiffs made a motion for class certification, which the Company opposed on July 22, 2005. On July 5, 2005, the Company moved for revision of the court's October 14, 2004 order
in light of a change in law, insofar as the order denied the Company's motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to plead loss causation. On December 2, 2005, the court denied
the Company's motion. On April 4, 2006 plaintiffs filed a partial motion for summary judgment that was denied without prejudice to its later renewal. On June 12, 2006, the court entered
an order certifying a class "consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Tyco securities between December 13, 1999 and June 7, 2002, and who were damaged
thereby, excluding defendants, all of the officers, directors and partners thereof, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in
which any of the foregoing have or had a controlling interest." On June 26, 2006, Tyco filed a petition for leave to appeal the class certification order to the United States Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit. On September 22, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Tyco's petition.

Class Action Settlement

On May 14, 2007, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities class
action lawsuits. The actions previously had been consolidated and transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire
and include

Williams v. Tyco International Ltd.

,

Brazen v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

,

Philip Cirella v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

,

Hromyak v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

,

Myers v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

,

Goldfarb v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

,

Rappold v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

,

Mandel v. Tyco
International Ltd., et al.

, and

Schuldt v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

and 23 other consolidated securities
cases.

The
Memorandum of Understanding does not resolve the following securities cases, which remain outstanding:

Stumpf v. Tyco
International Ltd.

,

New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

,

Ballard v. Tyco
International Ltd.

,

Jasin v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

, and

Hall v. Kozlowski, et
al

. The proposed
settlement does not release claims arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001, et seq. ("ERISA"), which are not common to all Class Members, including any
claims asserted in

Overby, et al. v. Tyco International Ltd.

, Civil Action No. 02-MD-1357-PB.

Under
the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration for
the payment of $2.975 billion from Tyco to the certified class and assignment to the class of any net recovery of any claims possessed by Tyco and the other settling defendants against Tyco's
former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Defendant PricewaterhouseCoopers was not a settling defendant and is not a party to the memorandum. However, PricewaterhouseCoopers subsequently agreed to
participate in the settlement as a settling defendant, and in consideration of a release of all claims against it by the parties to the Memorandum of Understanding, agreed to make a payment of
$225 million. We and the other settling defendants have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing and legal liability arising from any of the facts or conduct alleged in the actions.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, L. Dennis Kozlowski, Mark H. Swartz and Frank E. Walsh, Jr., also are excluded from the settling defendants, and the class will
assign


to
Tyco all of their claims against defendants Kozlowski, Swartz and Walsh. In exchange, we will agree to pay to the certified class 50% of any net recovery against these defendants.

The
parties to the Memorandum of Understanding have applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007, the U. S. District Court in Concord, New
Hampshire granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held. The Court indicated it would approve the settlement
and stated a formal ruling would be issued in a few weeks. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the Memorandum of Understanding will be null and void. By
December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.

The
deadline for deciding not to participate in the class settlement was September 28, 2007. As of such date, Tyco had received opt-out notices from individuals and
entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. These individuals and entities may pursue their claims separately against Tyco and any judgments resulting from such claims
would not reduce the settlement amount. One entity, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, has filed a complaint against Tyco on September 24, 2007 in an action styled

Franklin
Mutual Advisers, LLC v. Tyco International Ltd.

in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 77(b), Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 18
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(k) in connection with the plaintiffs' purchases and sales of Tyco securities between June 4, 2001 and April 30, 2002. The
plaintiffs seek unspecified
compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Tyco has requested that this action be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Tyco intends to
vigorously defend this litigation. It is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse
resolution of the

Franklin

matter or other unasserted claims from individuals that have opted-out.

Under
the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation, each of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable
for the full amount of the class action settlement and any judgments resulting from opt-out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies will share in the
liability and related escrow accounts, with Tyco assuming 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount.

Tyco
incurred a charge to expense, for which no tax benefit is available, and a current liability of $2.975 billion in 2007. The Company has also recovered or expects to recover
certain of these costs from insurers. As such, the Company recorded $113 million of recoveries in connection with the class action settlement in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Tyco
borrowed under its unsecured bridge and credit facilities to fund the liability and placed the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. In connection with the Separation, Covidien and Tyco
Electronics assumed their portion of the related borrowing. The escrow accounts will earn interest that is payable to the class. Interest is also accrued on the class action settlement liability.
Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at September 28, 2007, Tyco had a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability of $1,257 million
and $927 million, respectively, and a payable to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their interest in the escrow accounts. Receivables and payables that pertain to the class action settlement
and related escrow accounts with the same counterparty are presented net in the consolidated balance sheet. Tyco's portion of the liability is $808 million. Additionally, Tyco has paid
$73 million and recorded payables of $9 million at September 28, 2007, with an offset to shareholders' equity for amounts due to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of
the insurance recovery.

If
the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco, it is possible that the Company will be
required


to
pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Securities Class Action Proceedings

As previously reported in our periodic filings, an action entitled

Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.,

was filed on June 3, 2004 in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against certain of our former directors and officers, our former auditors and Tyco. The
complaint asserts claims of fraud, negligent representation, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with fiduciary relationship and conspiracy arising out of an underlying
settlement of litigation brought by shareholders in Progressive Angioplasty Systems, Inc. where the plaintiffs received our stock as consideration. The claim seeks unspecified monetary damages
and other relief. On October 25, 2006, the Court lifted its previous order staying the case during the pendency of a related arbitration to which Tyco was not a party. On December 26,
2006, Tyco filed a demurrer seeking dismissal of the action on the ground that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to state causes of action. Before argument could be heard on the
demurrer, the plaintiffs notified the Court that they would file an amended complaint. The amended complaint was filed on July 9, 2007. The amended complaint asserts claims of fraud, negligent
representation, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with, and subsequent to, an underlying settlement of litigation brought by shareholders in
Progressive Angioplasty Systems, Inc. where the plaintiffs received our stock as consideration. The amended complaint alleges collective losses of not less than $20 million and seeks
compensatory and punitive damages. On September 13, 2007, Tyco filed its answer to the complaint. The parties have also begun to engage in discovery, serving document requests and
interrogatories.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on October 30, 2003,

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd.

was transferred to
the District Court of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The complaint asserts claims against Tyco based on Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C.
Sec. 77(k), Section 15 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 77(o), Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78j(b), and Sec. 20(a) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. Sec. 78t(a). In orders dated September 2, 2005 and January 6, 2005, the Court denied Tyco's motion to dismiss. On June 12, 2007, the Court certified a purported class
consisting of "all persons or entities who purchased TyCom stock, either pursuant to a July 26, 2000, Registration Statement and Prospectus for TyCom's initial public offering, or on the open
market between July 26, 2000 and December 17, 2001." On June 26, 2007, Tyco and TyCom filed a Rule 23(f) Petition seeking leave to appeal the class certification order. On
September 13, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Tyco's petition.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on November 27, 2002 the State of New Jersey, on behalf of several state pension funds, filed a complaint,

New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Tyco, our former
auditors and certain of our former officers and directors. The complaint was amended on February 11, 2005. As against all defendants, the amended complaint asserts causes of action under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, for common law fraud, aiding and abetting common law fraud, conspiracy to commit
fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Claims are asserted against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 15 of the Securities Act
of 1933, Section 24(d) of the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law, Section 421-B:25(III) of the New Hampshire Uniform Securities Law, and for breaches of fiduciary
duties. Claims are also asserted against certain of the individual defendants under Section 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and for violation of the New Jersey RICO statute;


against
Tyco under Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 24(c) of the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law, Section 421-B:25(II) of the New
Hampshire Uniform Securities Law, and for violation of, aiding and abetting violation of, and vicarious liability under the New Jersey RICO statute; against Tyco and certain of the individual
defendants under Section 14(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and for conspiracy to violate the New Jersey RICO statute; against Tyco,
its former auditors, and certain of the individual defendants under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, and for violation of, and conspiracy to violate the New Jersey RICO statute; and
against our former auditors and certain of the individual defendants for aiding and abetting violation of the New Jersey RICO statute. Finally, claims are asserted against the individual defendants
and our former auditors for aiding and abetting the individual defendants' breaches of fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs assert that the defendants violated the securities laws and otherwise engaged in
fraudulent acts by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, the following: unauthorized and improper compensation of certain of our former
executives; their improper use of our funds for personal benefit and their improper self-dealing in real estate. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On
June 10, 2005, Tyco moved to dismiss in part the amended complaint. On June 11, 2007, the court granted in part and denied in part Tyco's motion to dismiss. Many of the above plaintiffs'
claims remain pending. On July 24, 2007, the plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaint again. Tyco responded in opposition to the motion on August 10, 2007, and the court has
not yet ruled on the plaintiffs' motion.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, the Company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit the decision of the United States District Court for the
District of New Hampshire to remand

Brazen v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

International Ltd., et al., Rappold v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.,

and

Schuldt v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

to the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the Company's appeal. On December 29, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit granted plaintiffs' motion and dismissed the Company's appeal. The Company moved in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida to stay and to strike the class allegations in

Goldfarb

,

Mandel

,

Myers

,

Rappold

, and

Schuldt

. The Circuit
Court granted Tyco's motion to dismiss

Hromyak

. The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal. These cases were included in the proposed settlement of the Securities Class
Action, which is contingent upon these cases being dismissed.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, after filing an initial complaint on June 26, 2002, plaintiff Lionel I. Brazen filed an amended class action complaint, on
March 10, 2005, in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois purporting to represent a class of purchasers who exchanged shares of Mallinckrodt, Inc. common stock for shares of Tyco
common stock pursuant to the Joint Proxy Statement and Prospectus, and the Registration Statement in which it was included, in connection with the October 17, 2000 merger of Tyco and
Mallinckrodt, Inc. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco International Ltd., and certain former Tyco executives and asserts causes of action under Section 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933. The amended class action complaint alleges that the defendants made statements in the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and Prospectus that were materially
false and misleading and failed to disclose material adverse facts regarding the business and operations of Tyco. The amended class action complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other
relief. On April 21, 2005, the Company moved in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois to dismiss or stay or, in the alternative, to strike the class allegations. On July 22, 2005,
the Court denied the Company's motion. On August 19, 2005, Tyco filed an interlocutory appeal of the Circuit Court for Cook County Illinois' July 22, 2005 memorandum and order, which was
subsequently denied. On January 6, 2006, the plaintiff, joined by an additional named plaintiff Nancy Hammerslough, filed a renewed motion for class certification which was granted. On
February 14, 2006, Tyco filed its answer to the complaint. On July 5, 2006, plaintiffs filed a partial motion for summary


judgment
which was denied on November 8, 2006. On November 22, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the denial of their motion for summary judgment. On January 25, 2007,
the Court denied plaintiffs' motion to reconsider. This case was included in the proposed settlement of the Securities Class Action, which settlement is contingent upon this case being dismissed.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on April 29, 2005, an action was filed against Tyco in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,

al.

Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On March 31, 2007, Tyco filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint and the Court granted the motion to dismiss on June 13, 2007.

On
January 31, 2003 a civil action was filed by three plaintiffs in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

Cirella v. Tyco
International et al

. Plaintiff named as defendants Tyco International Ltd., Dennis Kozlowski, Mark H. Swartz and Mark A. Belnick. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation has transferred the action to the United States District Court for the District of
New Hampshire. This case was included in the proposed settlement of the Securities Class Action, which is contingent upon the case being dismissed.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on January 20, 2004, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,

Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et
al.

Plaintiffs are trustees of various trusts that were allegedly major shareholders of AMP, Inc.,
a company acquired by Tyco in April 1999. Plaintiffs name as defendants Tyco, five of its former officers and directors and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC"). As against all defendants, the
complaint asserts causes of action under Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 11 of the Securities Act of
1933. As against the Tyco defendants, the complaint asserts causes of action under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder;
Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act; and for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation. As against the individual defendants, the complaint asserts causes of action under
Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Section 15 of the Securities Act. The complaint alleges that defendants engaged in a scheme to artificially inflate Tyco's earnings and
to mislead investors as to Tyco's positive earnings, growth and acquisition synergies prior to and in connection with its acquisition of AMP, Inc. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
transferred the action to the District of New Hampshire. Tyco moved to dismiss the complaint, and that motion was denied. On August 5, 2005, defendant Michael A. Ashcroft's motion to dismiss
with respect to the plaintiffs' claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, Section 15 of the Securities Act, and common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation
claims was granted.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, a complaint,

Sciallo v. Tyco International Ltd., et al

., was filed on
September 30, 2003 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs purport to be former executives of U.S. Surgical who traded their U.S. Surgical
stock options for Tyco International, Ltd. stock options when Tyco acquired U.S. Surgical on October 1, 1998. Plaintiffs name as defendants Tyco International Ltd. and certain
former Tyco directors and executives. The complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,
for common law fraud and negligence, and violation


of
New York General Business Law Section 349, which prohibits deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of any business. The complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and
misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, Tyco's financial condition and accounting practices. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to
the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, a complaint was filed on September 2, 2004 in the Court of Common Pleas for Dauphin County, Pennsylvania,

Jasin v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.

This

pro se

plaintiff named as additional defendants
Tyco International (US) Inc., L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and Director and Juergen W. Gromer,
President of Tyco Electronics. Plaintiff's complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933. Claims against Messrs. Kozlowski, Swartz and Gromer are also asserted under Section 14(a) of the

Securities Act of 1933. Plaintiff also asserts common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unfair trade practice, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and violation
of Section 1-402 of the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972. Tyco has removed the complaint to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation was notified that

Hall v. Kozlowski, et al.

an action relating to plaintiff's employment, 401(k) and pension plans and ownership of Tyco stock, may be an action that should be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of
New Hampshire. Thereafter, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On March 16, 2005, Tyco
International (US) Inc. answered plaintiff's amended complaint.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, plaintiff moved to remand

Davis v. Kozlowski et al

., an action originally filed on
December 9, 2003, from the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire back to the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. On March 17, 2005, the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted plaintiff's motion to remand and denied defendants' motion to dismiss. On March 31, 2005, the Company moved for reconsideration of the
Court's remand order. On July 17, 2006, the Court entered an order granting Tyco's motion to dismiss on the grounds that all of plaintiff's claims were preempted by federal law. The motion to
dismiss was granted without prejudice to plaintiff's right to file another action in state court asserting claims that are not preempted by federal law. On January 8, 2007, plaintiff filed an
action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On January 12, 2007, Tyco removed the re-filed action to
federal court in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. On February 1, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) issued a
conditional transfer order transferring the case to the District of New Hampshire. Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court on February 12, 2007 and moved the JPML to vacate
the conditional transfer order on March 9, 2007. We filed an opposition to the motion to vacate on March 29, 2007. On March 15, 2007, we filed an opposition to plaintiff's remand
motion and filed a cross-motion to dismiss the action. Briefing on the cross-motion was completed on April 26, 2007. On May 31, 2007, the JPML denied the motion to vacate the conditional
transfer order. On June 15, 2007 the JPML transferred the case back to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On October 16, 2007, Tyco filed its renewed
cross-motion to dismiss the action.


Shareholder Derivative Litigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, an action was filed on June 7, 2002 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,

Levin v.
Kozlowski

, alleging that the individually named defendants breached their fiduciary duties, committed waste and mismanagement and engaged in
self-dealing in connection with Tyco's accounting practices, individual board members' use of funds, and the financial disclosures of certain mergers and acquisitions. It is further
alleged that certain of the individual defendants converted corporate assets for their own use. Plaintiffs seek money damages. Plaintiffs agreed to stay that action pending the resolution of the
federal derivative action, which was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire on October 14, 2004; and the appeal from that ruling was voluntarily
dismissed on May 19, 2005. On June 14, 2005, the plaintiffs resumed the

Levin

action. On September 22, 2005, the Company filed a
motion to dismiss the derivative complaint. On November 14, 2006, the Supreme Court of the State of New York dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On December 11, 2006, plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal of the Court's November 14, 2006 order dismissing the complaint. On October 25, 2007, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First
Department, heard oral arguments in this action and on November 15, 2007, the Court denied the plaintiff's appeal.

ERISA Litigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco and certain of our current and former employees, officers and directors, have been named as defendants in
eight class actions brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). Two of the actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire and the six
remaining actions were transferred to that Court by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. All eight actions have been consolidated in the District Court in New Hampshire. The consolidated
complaint purports to bring claims on behalf of our Retirement Savings and Investment Plans and the participants therein and alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by
negligently misrepresenting and negligently failing to disclose material information concerning, among other things, the following: related-party transactions and executive compensation; our mergers
and acquisitions and the accounting therefor, as well as allegedly undisclosed acquisitions; and misstatements of our financial results. The complaint also asserts that the defendants breached their
fiduciary duties by allowing the Plans to invest in our shares when it was not a prudent investment. The complaints seek recovery of alleged plan losses arising from alleged breaches of fiduciary
duties. On January 12, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire denied, without prejudice, the Company's motion to dismiss certain additional individual
defendants from the action. On January 20, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On January 27, 2005, the Company answered the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint.
Also, on January 28, 2005, the Company and certain individual defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's January 12, 2005 order, insofar as it related to our Retirement
Committee. On May 25, 2005, the Court denied the motion for reconsideration. On July 11, 2005, the Company and certain individual defendants opposed plaintiffs' motion for class
certification. On August 15, 2006, the Court entered an order certifying a class "consisting of all Participants in the Plans for whose individual accounts the Plans purchased and/or held
shares of Tyco Stock Fund at any time from August 12, 1998 to July 25, 2002." On August 29, 2006, Tyco filed a petition for leave to appeal the class certification order to the
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On November 13, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Tyco's petition. On November 28, 2006,
plaintiffs filed a motion seeking an order directing them to serve notice of the ERISA class action on potential class members. Tyco did not object to service of notice on potential class members, and
on January 11, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion, assented to by Tyco that proposed an agreed upon form of notice. On January 18, 2007, the Court granted that motion. On December 5,
2006, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to file an amended complaint. Subsequently, on January 10, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion to withdraw their motion to amend the complaint without
prejudice.


ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund
(the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the Fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan such as the Fund, the employer is liable for
withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the
plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between Grinnell Fire Protection Systems, SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local
Union No. 669.

ERISA
requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan. A plan's assessment of
withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration, and ERISA requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration. If the employer
prevails in arbitration (and any subsequent court appeals), its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest. The Fund's total withdrawal liability assessment against
SimplexGrinnell is approximately $25 million, and the quarterly withdrawal liability payments are $1.1 million commencing on August 1, 2007. SimplexGrinnell believes that it has strong
arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the Fund, and it plans to vigorously defend against the Fund's withdrawal liability assessment by timely filing for arbitration. Accordingly, the
Company has made no provision for this contingency in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Tyco Litigation Against Former Senior Management

Tyco International Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, United States District Court, Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-7317, filed September 12, 2002, Amended April 1, 2003.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil
complaint against our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The Company amended that complaint on April 1, 2003. The amended
complaint alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from our Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program; awarded millions of dollars in unauthorized bonuses to himself and
certain other Tyco employees; engaged in improper self-dealing real estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco employees in committing these
acts. The amended complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, conversion, constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The amended
complaint seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's conduct, and of all remuneration, including restricted and unrestricted
shares and options, obtained by Mr. Kozlowski during the course of this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for
the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Mr. Kozlowski filed a motion to dismiss or stay the case and compel arbitration, which was denied on March 16, 2004, with one
exception relating to the arbitration of a claim asserting the fraudulent inducement of Mr. Kozlowski's retention agreement. On April 9, 2004, Mr. Kozlowski filed an Answer,
Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims, seeking amounts allegedly due pursuant to his purported retention agreement, life insurance policies, and other arrangements. Tyco filed its Reply to the
Counterclaims on April 29, 2004. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is proceeding.

Mr. Kozlowski
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of
Mr. Kozlowski began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to it, which were similar
to certain of the claims alleged in the Company's affirmative action described above, twenty-two were against Mr. Kozlowski. The jury found Mr. Kozlowski guilty on all
charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and securities fraud, and all but one count of falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Kozlowski was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of eight and one-third


years
to twenty-five years, and ordered to pay an individual fine of $70 million and restitution, jointly and severally with Mr. Swartz, to Tyco of $134 million within
one year. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Kozlowski filed a notice of appeal from his conviction and on October 3, 2006 filed a brief in support of his appeal. On January 2,
2007, by order of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the New York County District Attorney's office released to Tyco, on behalf of Mr. Kozlowski, $98 million in restitution. The
payment by Mr. Kozlowski was made pending the outcome of his appeal, which was denied on November 15, 2007.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 03-CV-2247
(TPG), filed April 1, 2003.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed an arbitration claim against Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and
director, on October 7, 2002. As a consequence of Mr. Swartz's refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association, we filed a civil complaint against him on
April 1, 2003, for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The action alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from our Key Employees Loan Program and
relocation program; approved and implemented awards of millions of dollars of unauthorized bonuses to himself and certain other Tyco employees; awarded millions of dollars in unauthorized payments to
himself; engaged in improper self dealing real estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco employees in committing these acts. The complaint alleges causes
of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, conversion, and constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The action seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a
result of the former Chief Financial Officer and director's conduct, and all remuneration, including restricted and unrestricted shares and options, obtained by Mr. Swartz during the course of
this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Mr. Swartz moved to dismiss Tyco's
complaint and to compel arbitration of the parties' respective claims. The court denied Swartz's motion and he has appealed the court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit. His appeal was heard on December 8, 2004. The First Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision on September 7, 2005. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is
proceeding.

Mr. Swartz
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of Mr. Swartz
began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to it, which were similar to certain of the
claims alleged in the Company's affirmative action described above, twenty-three were against Mr. Swartz. The jury found Mr. Swartz guilty on all charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and
securities fraud, and all but one count of falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Swartz was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight and
one-third years to twenty-five years, and ordered to pay an individual fine of $35 million and restitution, jointly and severally with Mr. Kozlowski, to Tyco of
$134 million within one year and Mr. Swartz was ordered individually to pay damages to Tyco in the amount of $1 million. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Swartz filed a
notice of appeal from his conviction and on October 3, 2006 filed a brief in support of his appeal. On October 27, 2006, Mr. Swartz paid restitution to the Company in the amount
of $38 million. The payment by Mr. Swartz was made pending the outcome of his appeal, which was denied on November 15, 2007.

Tyco International Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-9705, filed December 6, 2002.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against our former
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer and Director pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 for disgorgement of short-swing profits
from prohibited transactions in our common shares believed to exceed $40 million. The action seeks disgorgement of profits, interest, attorney's fees and costs. The Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz


moved
to dismiss the claims against them based upon the statute of limitations. On March 16, 2004, the District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted the defendants' motion to dismiss
in part with leave for Tyco to file an amended complaint. Tyco filed an amended complaint on May 14, 2004. The defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the amended complaint on
June 28, 2004. The defendants' motion to dismiss was denied on April 21, 2005. The defendants' motion to extend time to answer the complaint until thirty days after the conclusion of
deliberations in the criminal trial was granted on May 17, 2005. Both defendants filed their answers on July 18, 2005. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is proceeding.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Frank E. Walsh, Jr., United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 02-CV-4633,
filed June 17, 2002.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary
duty and related wrongful conduct involving receipt by Mr. Walsh of a $20 million payment in connection with our 2001 acquisition of the CIT Group, Inc. The action alleges causes
of action for restitution, breach of fiduciary duty and inducing breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and a constructive trust, and seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by
us as a result of the defendant director's conduct. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco, which was deposited by the Company in
January 2003, as a result of a plea bargain agreement with the New York County District Attorney. Our claims against Mr. Walsh are still pending. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is proceeding.

Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the U.S. Department of Labor, state
departments of labor, the General Service Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management,
operations, accounting and related controls. We are cooperating with these investigations and are complying with these requests.

Certain
of our current and former employees received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices for the ADT dealer connect
fees. The investigation, which began in June 2002, related to accounting practices employed by our former management. As previously reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been
discontinued.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, in November 2004, we received an order from the SEC to report facts and circumstances involving our participation, if any, in the
United Nations Oil for Food Program governing sales of Iraqi oil. On January 10, 2005 and November 8, 2005, we responded to the order and provided information concerning transactions
under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. On January 31, 2006, we received a subpoena from the SEC to produce additional documents and information related to the participation of three of
our businesses in the United Nations Oil for Food Program. The SEC notified us on June 7, 2006 that it was not recommending any enforcement action against Tyco in connection with its
investigation of the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Recently, we have discovered additional product sales that may be responsive to the SEC's order and have notified the SEC staff that we intend
to investigate these transactions. While it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of this matter, we do not believe this discovery will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
U.S. Department of Labor served document subpoenas on Tyco and Fidelity Management Trust Company for documents concerning the administration of our Retirement Savings and Investment
Plans. The current focus of the Department's inquiry concerns the losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in our stock. The Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on
behalf of the plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the plans for recovery of losses and additional penalties, although it has not informed us of any intention to do so.
The Company is continuing to cooperate with the Department's investigation.


As previously reported in our periodic filings, on January 27, 2006, we received from the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice Office of the Attorney General a subpoena to
produce documents concerning, among other things, former employees, the use of certain chemicals, and the filing of reports under state and federal environmental reporting laws at the same New Jersey
facility sold by Tyco in 2000. The subpoena seeks information for the period from January 1987 to December 2000. We have provided information in response to the subpoena and discussed
the matter with the agency. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an
adverse resolution. Tyco continues to cooperate fully with the investigators.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site
cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of
September 28, 2007, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $36 million to $63 million. As of September 28,
2007, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $40 million, of which $11 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and
$29 million is included in other liabilities on Tyco's Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company believes that
any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos Matters

As previously reported in its periodic filings, Tyco and some of its subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries of Covidien are named as defendants in personal injury
lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien has assumed all liabilities for pending cases filed against its
subsidiaries. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. The complaints generally seek monetary damages for personal injury or bodily injury resulting from alleged
exposure to products containing asbestos. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to
asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims. However, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been
immaterial. As of September 28, 2007 there were approximately 5,600 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.

Income Tax Matters

During the third quarter of 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and
issued anticipated Revenue Agents' Reports ("RARs") which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of
the Company's previously filed tax return positions, all of which the Company expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, the Company has made no additional provision
during the year ended September 28, 2007 as a result of the proposed audit adjustments in the RARs.

The
Company has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to the Company of $458 million, and during the third quarter of
2007, the Company paid $458 million, of which $163 million relates to the Company's discontinued operations. The Company appealed other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling
approximately $1 billion, and, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend


its
prior filed tax return positions. The Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its financial statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the ultimate
resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these
matters could result in the Company filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on the Company's
effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

Additionally,
the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection
with certain intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and
$50 million. The Company as Audit Managing Party will vigorously oppose the assertion of such penalties against Tyco Electronics, in part, because beginning in 2003 the Company discovered,
investigated and reported the conduct at issue to the IRS and fully cooperated in the criminal prosecution of the Company's former Chief Tax Officer on a charge of willful filing of a false tax
return.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we have received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were
made by our subsidiaries in recent years. As previously reported, we have been informed that two subsidiaries in our Flow Control business in Italy have been named in a request for criminal charges
filed by the Milan public prosecutor's office. We have reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that we have taken in response to
the allegations. We also informed the DOJ and the SEC that we retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of our policies, controls and practices with respect to
compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), that we would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that we would present our factual findings upon conclusion
of the baseline review. We have and will continue to communicate with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings
concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by us in the course of our ongoing compliance activities. Covidien and Tyco Electronics agreed, in connection with the
Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its response to these allegations. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements.
At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or
extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of these matters. However, it is possible that we may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts
that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Any
judgment required to be paid or settlement or other cost incurred by Tyco in connection with these matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics businesses of Tyco to Covidien or Tyco Electronics, respectively, and provides that Tyco
will retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations. Any liabilities not primarily related to a particular segment will be shared equally among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics.

The
German Federal Cartel Office ("FCO") charged that certain German subsidiaries in Tyco's Flow Control business have engaged in anti-competitive practices, in particular
with regard to its hydrant, valve, street box and fittings business. Tyco investigated this matter and determined that the conduct may have violated German anti-trust-law. Tyco
is cooperating with the FCO in its investigation of this violation. Tyco cannot estimate the range of potential loss that may result from this violation. It


is
possible that the Company may be subject to civil or criminal proceedings and may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Indenture Trustee Litigation

On June 4, 2007, The Bank of New York ("BONY"), as indenture trustee under the indentures dated as of June 9, 1998 and November 12, 2003, of
Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco, commenced an action against TIGSA and Tyco in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. BONY
served an amended complaint on October 18, 2007, which added Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA") as an additional defendant. As amended, the complaint alleges that the Separation breached
the indentures and seeks damages on behalf of noteholders in excess of $4.1 billion, consisting of principal plus accrued interest on the notes issued under the indentures, plus a
"make-whole" amount payable under the indentures in the event of early redemption of the notes. The amended complaint also seeks a judgment declaring that BONY was not required to sign
supplemental indentures proposed by TIGSA, TIFSA and Tyco in connection with the Separation. BONY also seeks a declaratory judgment that TIGSA is obligated to pay BONY reasonable compensation and to
reimburse BONY for all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the Separation and in resolving the proper interpretation of the indentures. On November 15,
2007, Tyco and TIFSA filed counterclaims against BONY, alleging that its refusal to sign the supplemental indentures in connection with the Separation and the filing of the amended complaint
constituted a breach of the indentures and a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in the indentures. They seek unspecified damages on these claims. Tyco and TIFSA also seek a
declaratory judgment that no default has occurred and that BONY is required to sign the supplemental indentures.

On
November 8, 2007, BONY delivered to the Company a Notice of Events of Default, claiming that the actions taken by the Company in connection with the Separation constitute
events of default under the indentures. The claims made in the Notice of Events of Default are the same as those alleged by BONY in the litigation, and the Company continues to believe that no default
or event of default has occurred. The indentures provide for a 90-day cure period following delivery of the notice of default, after which BONY could declare any outstanding amounts under
the indentures immediately due and payable. We would contest such an acceleration.

TIGSA,
TIFSA and Tyco continue to believe that the Separation and the proposed supplemental indentures are permitted under the indentures and that no "make-whole" amount is
payable. The Company intends to vigorously defend the claims of default and believes it will prevail in legal proceedings.

If
we did not have liquidity available to repay the outstanding debt under the 1998 and 2003 indentures under our 364-day bridge facility, such an acceleration of the
outstanding notes would have permitted a majority of the lenders under each of our bank and letter of credit facilities to demand repayment of amounts outstanding under those facilities, and to
terminate their commitments to extend additional credit thereunder. As a result, on November 27, 2007, the Company secured additional firm commitments from certain of its lenders under the
bridge facility, providing the Company with additional borrowings of up to $4.0 billion to repay such notes. The additional commitments expire on, and any borrowings under the facility would
mature on, November 25, 2008. The facility may only be used to repay, settle or otherwise extinguish the amounts required to be paid in connection with the litigation with BONY.


Other Matters

Earth Tech v. City of Phoenix

is a contract dispute arising from Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix,
Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. On December 21, 2005, Earth Tech filed a lawsuit against the City of Phoenix in the Maricopa County
Superior Court alleging $3 million in damages plus interest for the City's failure to pay dewatering and computer systems costs related to the 91

st

Avenue project. After the City
rejected Earth Tech's administrative claim against the City, Earth Tech filed and served a First Amended Complaint upon the City of Phoenix. In its First Amended Complaint, Earth Tech alleged eighteen
causes of action and requested the following: (i) a recovery of at least $73 million for the value of the services performed by Earth Tech in connection with the contract; (ii) a
rescission of the contract; (iii) an equitable adjustment of the Contract price for additional dewatering services and the Computer Control System; and (iv) costs for demobilization and
termination of the contract. The City of Phoenix filed a Motion to Dismiss rather than filing an answer to the First Amended Complaint on May 18, 2006. The Court granted the City's Motion to
Dismiss without prejudice on September 19, 2006 allowing Earth Tech 30 days to file a Second Amended Complaint. Earth Tech filed its Second Amended Compliant against the City of
Phoenix on September 25, 2006. In connection with this matter, the Company has assets, which it has assessed as recoverable, of $50 million at September 28, 2007 and
September 29, 2006.

On
December 29, 2005, the City of Phoenix filed a lawsuit against Earth Tech, Inc., its surety, Federal Insurance Company and other unnamed parties in the Maricopa County
Superior Court,

The City of Phoenix v. Earth Tech, Inc., Federal Insurance Company and John Does 1-50.

The lawsuit is in connection
with the City of Phoenix's termination on August 12, 2005 of Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment
Plant. The City alleges the following causes of action: (i) Earth Tech breached its Pre-Construction Services and Construction Management at Risk Contracts; (ii) Earth Tech
did not properly, reasonably or timely manage, supervise or inspect the work under the Contracts; (iii) Federal Insurance breached the terms and conditions of the performance bond; and
(iv) Federal Insurance failed to investigate the City's Bond Claims. The City requested unspecified general, consequential, incidental, special and liquidated damages plus interest as its
relief. On February 8, 2006, Earth Tech filed a Motion to Dismiss the City's Complaint in which Federal Insurance Company joined. The Court denied Earth Tech's
Motion to Dismiss on September 25, 2006. The City of Phoenix filed an Amended Complaint against Earth Tech and Federal Insurance on September 25, 2006. In the Amended Complaint, the City
of Phoenix alleged damages of $128 million.

The
Presiding Judge of Maricopa County Superior Court on July 11, 2006 consolidated all of the pending lawsuits related to this dispute on the Court's complex litigation docket.
On June 6, 2007, the Court granted Earth Tech's motion for partial summary judgment, ordering that application of Arizona's Prompt Payment Act was appropriate and that any material
inconsistencies in the contract be resolved in favor of the Act's requirements. On October 19, 2007, Earth Tech filed a second motion related to the Prompt Payment Act, arguing that the City of
Phoenix breached its contract with Earth Tech by failing to make payment on a Payment Application that was deemed certified and approved under the Proper Payment Act. The Court is likely to rule on
the motion sometime in the spring of 2008. Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an
adverse resolution of this matter.

Fitzpatrick Contractors Limited v. Tyco Fire and Integrated Solutions (UK) Ltd.

On July 18, 2007, Fitzpatrick Contractors
Limited ("FCL") commenced an action against Tyco Fire and Integrated Solutions (UK) Ltd. in the High Court of Justice, Queen Bench Division, Technology and Construction Court,
United Kingdom, alleging that Tyco entered into a binding contract in 2002 for the design, manufacture and installation of mechanical and electrical works for the refurbishment of a portion of London
Transport's Blackwell Tunnel. FCL seeks a declaratory judgment that a contract was formed between the parties and seeks damages for breach of contract in the amount of approximately $38


million.
Tyco believes it has valid counterclaims for unpaid amounts owed to it by FCL for design work, purchased equipment and subcontracted construction work associated with the project, but denies
that it entered a binding contract with FCL for the project and intends to defend this action vigorously. While it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of this dispute, Tyco does
not believe this action will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Sensormatic Security Corp. v. Sensormatic Electronics Corp., ADT Security Services, Inc. and Wallace Computer Services, Inc.

In April 2002, litigation was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland by a Sensormatic franchisee, Sensormatic Security Corp. ("SSC"), alleging breach of contract
against Sensormatic and tortuous interference with contract against ADT and Wallace Computer Services, Inc., a party unrelated to Tyco. The litigation was based on allegedly unpaid commissions
under a franchise agreement. The lawsuit also alleges that Sensormatic improperly authorized third parties (including ADT and Wallace) to sell in SSC's exclusive territory of Maryland, Virginia and
the District of Columbia. Sensormatic has agreed to indemnify Wallace. SSC seeks an accounting, monetary damages (including punitive damages against ADT and Wallace), and injunctive relief.
Sensormatic and ADT have denied SSC's allegations and asserted affirmative defenses. Sensormatic also filed a counterclaim seeking recovery of overpayments made to SSC. On September 7, 2006,
the trial court denied in part and granted in part the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. Among other things, the Court ruled that SSC has the right to commissions on all Sensormatic CCTV
products (not just SensorVision systems) if sold for automatic theft detection in the
franchise territory and SSC has the right to commissions on CCTV indirect sales if sold for automatic theft detection in the franchise territory. Sensormatic and ADT intend to appeal those rulings.
Sensormatic and ADT will continue to vigorously defend the litigation. While it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of this dispute, Tyco does not believe this action will have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

None.


PART II

Item 5.    Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The number of registered holders of Tyco's common shares at November 15, 2007 was 26,295.

Tyco
common shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Bermuda Stock Exchange under the symbol "TYC." The following table sets forth the high and low
closing sales prices of Tyco common shares as reported by the NYSE, and the dividends paid on Tyco common shares, for the quarterly periods presented below. In connection with the Separation,
effective June 29, 2007, the Company, as approved by its Board of Directors, effected a reverse stock split of Tyco's common shares, at a split ratio of one for four. Shareholder approval for
the reverse stock split was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders. Market price range was adjusted for the Separation. Dividends per common share reflect the
reverse stock split only.

Dividend Policy

On September 13, 2007 Tyco's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Company's common shares of $0.15 per share payable on
November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007. The dividend per common share in the above table represents that of Tyco
pre-Separation, which included Covidien and Tyco Electronics. Following the Separation, Covidien and Tyco Electronics declared quarterly dividends as independent public companies. The
timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the
statutory requirements of Bermuda law, our financial condition and results of operations, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors
deems relevant. Additionally, we may from time to time enter into financing
agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions, some of which may limit the ability of Tyco to pay dividends.

The
Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") provides for the award of stock options, restricted shares and other equity or
equity-based awards to Board members, officers and non-officer employees. Amount shown under shares outstanding includes 114,299 deferred stock unit ("DSU") grants and dividend equivalents
earned on each DSU account, 14,783,049 shares to be issued upon exercise of options, 964,523 restricted shares, 3,550,631 restricted stock units and 531,310 performance share units ("PSUs")
representing target payout. Amount shown under shares available reflects the aggregate shares available under the LTIP I, LTIP II and 2004 Plans. Shares available under the LTIP I and LTIP II Plans in
March 2004 were rolled into the 2004 Plan as of the inception of the Plan.

(2)

The
Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP I Plan") provides for the grant of stock options and other equity or equity-based grants to Board
members, officers and non-officer employees. Amounts shown exclude 567,486 outstanding stock options assumed in connection with acquisitions at a weighted-average exercise price of $64.61.
No additional options may be granted under those assumed plans. Amount shown includes 4,318,622 shares to be issued upon exercise of options, 914,353 DSU grants, and dividend equivalents earned on
each DSU account. The shares will be issued upon exercise. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, adopted in March, 2004, no additional options, equity or equity-based grants will be made under the LTIP I
Plan. The shares granted under the LTIP I Plan will be issued upon exercise under the 2004 Plan.

(3)

This
table includes 3,088,945 shares available for future issuance under the Tyco Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), which represents the number of remaining
shares registered for issuance under this plan. All of the shares delivered to participants under the ESPP are purchased in the open market. During 2007, the ESPP was suspended in connection with the
Separation. We expect to reinstate the ESPP during 2008.

(4)

The
Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan") provides for the grant of stock options and other equity or equity-based grants to
employees who are not officers of Tyco. Under this plan, non-officer employees or former employees of Tyco or a subsidiary could receive: (i) options to purchase Tyco common shares;
(ii) stock appreciation rights; (iii) awards payable in cash, common shares, other securities or other property, based on the achievement of performance goals; (iv) dividend
equivalents, consisting of a right to receive payments equivalent to dividends declared on Tyco common shares; and (v) other stock-based awards as determined by the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee. The exercise price of options and stock appreciation rights would generally be fair market value on the date of grant, but could be lower in certain circumstances. No individual
could receive awards for more than 12,000,000 shares (or 3,000,000 shares on a post reverse stock split basis) in any calendar year. Terms and conditions of awards were determined by the Committee.
Awards could be deferred, and could be payable in any form the Committee determined, including cash, Tyco common shares, other securities or other property. The Committee may modify awards in
recognition of unusual or


nonrecurring
events, including a change of control. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, adopted in March 2004, no additional options, equity or equity-based grants will be made under the LTIP II
Plan. The shares granted under the LTIP II Plan will be issued at vesting under the 2004 Plan.

(5)

The
Tyco International Ltd. UK Savings Related Share Option Plan (the "SAYE Plan") is a UK Inland Revenue approved plan for UK employees pursuant to which
employees may be granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at a 15% discount off the market price at time of grant. Employees make monthly contributions that are, at the
election of the employee, used for the purchase price or returned to the employee. The total amount of shares that may be purchased at the end of the three years of service is equal to the total of
the monthly contributions, plus a tax-free bonus amount equal to a multiple of the aggregate amount of monthly contributions, divided by the option price. An option will generally be
exercisable only during the period of six months following the three-year period. The plan is administered by the Company's Senior Vice President of Human Resources, as delegated by the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee. The Senior Vice President of Human Resources, among other things, determines when to grant options and sets the option price in accordance with the SAYE
Plan's rules.

The transactions described in the table above primarily represent the repurchase of common shares on the NYSE as part of the $1.0 billion
share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in September 2007. The average price paid per share is calculated by dividing the total cash paid for the shares by the total number
of shares repurchased. Approximately $944 million remained outstanding under this share repurchase program at September 28, 2007. The Company, through an affiliate, also acquires shares
from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. Approximately 51,000 shares were acquired in these vesting-related
transactions outside of the share repurchase program during the quarter ended September 28, 2007.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings
"Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Introduction

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its
subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States ("GAAP").

In
connection with the Separation, Tyco Healthcare changed its name to Covidien Ltd. ("Covidien"). As Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically accounted for 55% of our revenues,
we have realigned our management and segment reporting structure and report financial and operating information in the following five segments, effective March 31, 2007:

•

ADT Worldwide

designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems to residential, commercial,
industrial and governmental customers.

•

Fire Protection Services

designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems to commercial,
industrial and governmental customers.

•

Flow Control

designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products
for the water and wastewater markets, the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries.

•

Safety Products

designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including fire
suppression products, breathing apparatus, intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide
and Fire Protection Services.

•

Electrical and Metal Products

designs, manufactures and sells steel tubing and pipe products, as well as cable products,
including pre-wired armored cable and flexible conduit products for commercial construction.

We
also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Infrastructure Services, previously
reported as part of Corporate and Other, met the held for sale criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.

References
to the segment data are to the Company's continuing operations. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations.

Overview

Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly Healthcare and Electronics businesses,
respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies (the "Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders. The distribution was made on June 29, 2007, to Tyco shareholders of
record on June 18, 2007, the record date. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.25 of a common share of each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for each Tyco common


share
held on the record date. Tyco shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts of less than one Covidien or Tyco Electronics common share. The distribution was structured to
be tax-free to Tyco shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tyco's former Healthcare and
Electronics businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

Additionally,
on the distribution date, the Company, as approved by its Board of Directors, effected a reverse stock split of Tyco's common shares, at a split ratio of one for four.
Shareholder approval for the reverse stock split was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders. Share and per share data for all periods presented have been adjusted
to reflect the reverse stock split.

We
have and will continue to incur separation costs related to debt refinancing, tax restructuring, professional services and employee-related costs. We currently estimate that the total
income statement charges will be approximately $1.4 billion, after-tax, much of which will be reflected as discontinued operations. During 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred
pre-tax costs related to the Separation, including the $647 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2007, of $1,083 million and $169 million, respectively. Of
this amount, $105 million and $49 million is included in separation costs, $259 million and $0 million related to loss on early extinguishment of debt is included in other
expense, net and $719 million and $120 million is included in discontinued operations, respectively. Most of the remaining charges are expected to be incurred during the first six months
of fiscal 2008.

Additionally,
2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write-off of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable of $183 million,
of which $95 million is included in income taxes and $88 million is included in discontinued operations.

On
April 27, 2007, in connection with the Separation, Tyco and certain of its subsidiaries that are issuers of its corporate debt commenced tender offers to purchase for cash
substantially all of its outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt. Additionally, on April 30, 2007, Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("TIGSA"),
commenced tender offers to purchase for cash all of its outstanding Euro and Pound Sterling denominated public debt. In connection with the debt tender offers, Tyco incurred a pre-tax
charge for the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $647 million, for which no tax benefit is available.

In
connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 we reorganized to a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these organizational changes, we
assessed new reporting units, assigned goodwill to the new reporting units and tested goodwill for impairment. As a result, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in 2007 in the ADT
Worldwide segment.

We
remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. In September 2007, Tyco's Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which, we
repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares for $56 million. During 2007 we also completed the $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May
2006. Additionally, during 2006 we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July of 2005. During 2007, we paid dividends of $791 million
to shareholders. On September 13, 2007 Tyco's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Company's common shares of $0.15 per share payable on November 1, 2007 to
shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007.

During
2007, we sold Aquas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a
pre-tax gain of $19 million was recorded. AIJ met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.


We
are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision. Tyco will
explore a number of strategic alternatives for under-performing or non-strategic businesses including possible divestiture. In July 2007, the Board of Directors approved for
divestiture Infrastructure Services which was previously reported as part of Corporate and Other. Infrastructure Services had total net revenue of $1.3 billion and operating income of
$53 million in 2007. Infrastructure Services met the held for sale
criteria in the fourth quarter of 2007 and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.

To
further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we launched a restructuring program across all segments, including the corporate organization, which will
streamline some of the businesses and reduce the operational footprint. We expect to incur charges related to the program of approximately $350 million to $400 million through the end of
2008. During 2007, we incurred charges of $204 million, of which $7 million was recorded in cost of sales, and utilized cash of $70 million related to this program. We believe
this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term.

Class Action Settlement

On May 14, 2007, Tyco entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities
class action lawsuits.

Under
the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration for
the payment of $2.975 billion from Tyco to the certified class. The parties to the Memorandum of Understanding have applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On
July 13, 2007, the U. S. District Court in Concord, New Hampshire granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement
was held. The Court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued in a few weeks. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the
Memorandum of Understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.

The
deadline for deciding not to participate in the class settlement was September 28, 2007. As of such date, Tyco had received opt-out notices from individuals and
entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. These individuals and entities may pursue their claims separately against Tyco and any judgments resulting from such claims
would not reduce the settlement amount. One entity, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, has filed a complaint against Tyco on September 24, 2007 in an action styled

Franklin
Mutual Advisers, LLC v. Tyco International Ltd.

in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 77(b), Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and
Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(k) in connection with the plaintiffs' purchases and sales of Tyco securities between June 4, 2001
and April 30, 2002. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Tyco has requested that this action be transferred to the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Tyco intends to vigorously defend the litigation. It is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or
range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the

Franklin

matter or other unasserted claims from individuals that
have opted-out.


Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation, each of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable
for the full amount of the class action settlement and any judgments resulting from opt-out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability
and related escrow accounts, with Tyco assuming 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount.

Tyco
incurred a charge to expense, for which no tax benefit is available, and a current liability of $2.975 billion in 2007. The Company has also recovered or expects to recover
certain of these costs from insurers. As such, the Company recorded $113 million of recoveries in connection with the class action settlement in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Tyco
borrowed under its unsecured bridge and credit facilities to fund the liability and placed the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. In connection with the Separation, Covidien and Tyco
Electronics assumed their portion of the related borrowing. The escrow accounts will earn interest that is payable to the class. Interest is also accrued on the class action settlement liability.
Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at September 28, 2007 Tyco had a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability of $1,257 million
and $927 million, respectively, and a payable to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their interest in the escrow accounts. Receivables and payables that pertain to the class action settlement
and related escrow accounts with the same counterparty are presented net in the consolidated balance sheet. Tyco's portion of the liability is $808 million. Additionally, Tyco has paid
$73 million and recorded payables of $9 million at September 28, 2007, with an offset to shareholders' equity for amounts due to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of
the insurance recovery.

Net revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 8.3%, for 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of growth in all of our segments. The increase in net
revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of volume growth from continued strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, ADT Worldwide had strong growth in Asia and Latin America,
as well as growth in its recurring revenue base and


contracting
revenue in North America. Fire Protection Services experienced continued growth in electronic and mechanical contracting. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected 2007 by
$586 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected 2007 by $48 million.

Operating
income decreased $3.1 billion for 2007. Operating income was primarily impacted by the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion. Revenue growth in
all segments was partially offset by lower margins in Electrical and Metal Products primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel and copper products. Additionally, operating income was impacted
by costs incurred relating to the Separation and the restructuring program announced in November 2006. Separation related costs impacted operating income by $105 million for 2007 and
$49 million for 2006. Restructuring and asset impairment charges, net impacted operating income by $217 million for 2007. Also impacting operating income was a goodwill impairment charge
of $46 million due to the reorganization into our new management and segment reporting structure. Divestiture charges impacted 2007 by $4 million. Restructuring, asset impairment and
divestiture charges, net were $15 million for 2006.

Net
revenue increased $671 million, or 4.0%, for 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of growth in four of our segments. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow
Control as a result of volume growth from strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased selling prices of armored cable products due to
higher costs of copper within Electrical and Metal Products during 2006. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected 2006 by
$85 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected the period by $118 million.

Operating
income increased $179 million, or 15.0%, for 2006 while operating margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 7.9%. The increase in operating income was driven by
growth in three of our segments as well as reduced operating expenses in corporate, partially offset by lower margins in ADT Worldwide and Safety Products. Operating income for 2006 was unfavorably
affected by a $100 million charge relating to a pre-existing voluntary replacement program for certain sprinkler heads, incremental stock option charges of $84 million as
required under SFAS No. 123R, "

Share-Based Payments

," Separation related costs of $49 million and net restructuring, asset impairment and
divestiture charges of $15 million. Operating income for 2006 also included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life
insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated
workers' compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. Operating income during 2005 was negatively affected by net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of
$40 million. In addition, 2005 was unfavorably affected by a charge of $50 million related to an SEC enforcement action and a $70 million charge for estimated contingencies
related to contested legal proceedings seeking to enforce retention agreements for five former executives.

Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 6.1% during 2007, with product revenue up 7.4% and service revenue up 5.5%, as compared to 2006. Revenue
from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of
burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer anti-theft systems. The 2.8% revenue growth in North America resulted largely from an
increase in commercial installations, primarily in the retailer market, as well as an increase in the recurring revenue base. Revenue in the EMEA region grew 8.7%, primarily driven by favorable
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The 14.5% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by strong growth in Asia and Latin America and, to a lesser extent, favorable
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, net revenue was


favorably
affected by $213 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million.

North
America is the most profitable geographic area for ADT Worldwide with 2007 and 2006 operating margin of 17.1% and 16.6%, respectively. ADT EMEA, while profitable with 2007 and 2006
operating margin of 3.1% and 6.3%, respectively, has strong future prospects but is not performing to the level we believe is attainable. As part of our long term program to improve profitability in
ADT EMEA, several specific actions have been started, including the appointment of new general management and initiation of an estimated $90 million restructuring program to improve field
efficiency, operations and consolidate certain administrative functions. We incurred charges of $69 million related to this restructuring program in 2007 which negatively impacted operating
margins.

Attrition
rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business continued to improve, declining to an average of 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis for 2007, as compared to 14.2%
for 2006 and 15.0% in 2005. As a result of our ongoing review of attrition rates and other pertinent factors affecting the related patterns in which revenues are expected to be earned, management
reassessed amortization and depreciation methods and lives for its company-owned security systems and dealer intangible assets and made adjustments in 2007 (see Note 1).

Operating
income of $842 million in 2007 decreased $65 million from $907 million in 2006. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased
volume, operational efficiencies and reductions to depreciation and amortization expense, of $26 million. The decrease to depreciation and amortization expense resulted from changes to the
depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. These increases were more than offset by a goodwill
impairment charge of $46 million, due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure, as well as increased investment in selling and marketing in Americas and Asia. In
addition, results for 2007 included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $83 million, which were primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidating
certain administrative functions in Europe, and an impairment of certain indefinite lived intangible assets. Net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $5 million in 2006.

During
the fourth quarter of 2007, ADT Worldwide began converting certain North American customers to digital backup services in advance of the February 2008
analog-to-digital signal transition for wireless cellular carriers. Given the Company's experience with this conversion in the fourth quarter, we estimate that the cost of the
conversion will negatively impact operating income by approximate $40 million to $50 million in the first half of 2008.

Net
revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 1.4% during 2006, with product revenue up 3.0% compared to 2005. Revenue grew 10.6% in the Rest of World geographies, driven primarily by strong
growth in Asia and Latin America. Revenue in North America was up slightly, while revenue in the EMEA region declined due to the continued high attrition of the legacy account base in Continental
Europe. Net revenue was unfavorably affected by $35 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net
revenue by $19 million.

Operating
income decreased $45 million in 2006 from 2005. Results for 2006 included net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $5 million as compared to
net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $13 million in 2005. Operating income for 2006 was negatively affected by slightly lower gross margin, due largely to margin
pressures in commercial contracting coupled with a slightly higher mix of lower-margin contracting revenue. These effects were partially offset by cost savings related to operational excellence
initiatives. In addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by incremental stock option charges of $14 million required under SFAS No. 123R.

Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $225 million, or 6.9%, during 2007 as compared to 2006, driven largely by a 9.9%
increase in revenue from product sales. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue comprises inspection, maintenance, service and
monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. This increase was largely the result of strong growth in most regions which benefited from continuing strength in commercial construction activity
in our focused end-markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $99 million while divestitures had a negative impact of $30 million.

Operating
income increased $14 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting largely from increased volume, and improved margins, primarily in North America. Results for 2007
included net restructuring charges of $33 million, of which $1 million is included in cost of sales, primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidate certain
administrative functions in Europe, compared to no charges 2006.

Net
revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $99 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 as compared to 2005, driven largely by a 6.3% increase in revenue from product sales. Most of
the revenue increase occurred in North America, which experienced strong bookings and increasing backlog throughout most of the past two years. Revenue was unfavorably affected by $39 million
related to divestitures and $22 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Operating
income increased $37 million in 2006 over 2005. Higher revenue, slightly improved gross margin and continued control of general and administrative expenses contributed
to the improved operating results. Operating income for 2006 was also favorably affected by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. In
addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by incremental stock option charges of $8 million required under SFAS No. 123R.

Net revenue for Flow Control increased $631 million, or 20.1%, in 2007 as compared 2006. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by
volume growth from continued strength in most industrial


end
markets with significant project growth in the energy and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was strong across all geographical regions, and, in particular, Asia-Pacific and
Europe. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $197 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue
by $16 million.

The
increase in operating income of $101 million, or 28.4%, in 2007 as compared 2006 was primarily due to revenue growth, as well as improved utilization rates. The increase in
operating income during 2007 was partially offset by net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $25 million, which includes $6 million in cost of sales, $3 million of
divestiture charges, and $1 million of Separation costs.

Net
revenue for Flow Control increased $329 million, or 11.7%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from strength in most
industrial end markets with substantial project growth in the energy, process and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was particularly strong in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. The
increases in revenue were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $43 million.

The
increase in operating income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to revenue growth mentioned above, along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives. This
increase was partially offset by the impact of incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $7 million.

Net revenue for Safety Products increased $92 million, or 5.5%, during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily from strong performance in the
fire suppression and electronic security businesses. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $48 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in the fire
suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors in the Americas and the Middle East as well as increased selling prices to help offset the significant cost
increase of raw materials. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. These increases were partially offset
by continued softness in the life safety business in North America due to delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments.

Operating
income increased $84 million to $286 million for the year ended September 28, 2007 compared to the prior year. Prior year results included a
$100 million charge related to a pre-existing Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. The deadline for filing claims to
participate in the VRP ended on August 31, 2007. In light of the most current claims data, an additional $10 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Net
revenue for Safety Products decreased $7 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 driven by the unfavorable impact of $56 million from divested businesses as well as
delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments which unfavorably impacted the life safety business. These decreases were


partially
offset by stronger performance in the fire suppression business as a result of favorable market conditions in the United States, Middle East and China and new product introductions,
including clean agent fire suppression systems. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. Foreign currency
exchange rates negatively impacted revenues by $7 million.

Operating
income decreased $76 million in 2006 over 2005 primarily as a result of a $100 million charge related to a pre-existing voluntary replacement program
for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. This charge reflected our updated estimate of the additional costs necessary to bring the program to completion. The decrease in operating income
during 2006 was partially offset by volume growth and higher margins from new product introductions and price increases in the fire suppression and electronic security business, as well as cost
reduction benefits from the 2004 restructuring programs. Also, 2006 results include the effect of incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $5 million.

Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $25 million, or 1.3%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. Favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates of $20 million contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased sales volume of armored cable products, steel tubular
products, and higher selling prices and sales volumes in Brazil. These increases were largely offset by the impact of lower selling prices on steel tubular products in North America.

The
decrease in operating income of $160 million, or 50.2%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products.
Income generated by higher sales volume for both armored cable and steel tubular products were more than offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material prices.

Net
revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $151 million, or 8.4%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue in 2006 was largely driven by increased
selling prices of armored cable products as a result of higher costs of copper and higher volumes of core steel products due to growth in the non-residential construction markets in North
America. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $15 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above
increases in revenue were partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices on core steel products in North America mainly due to lower costs of steel and a slower market for products in Brazil.

The
increase in operating income of $24 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to favorable copper spreads and higher volumes of core steel products. These
increases were partially offset by the impact of reduced spreads for core steel products and incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $3 million.

Corporate and Other includes the operating results of certain international buildings products businesses.

Corporate
expense for 2007 included class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion, Separation related costs of $104 million, and net restructuring charges of
$40 million primarily related to the consolidation of certain headquarter functions. Additionally, corporate expense for 2007 includes $13 million of charges related to the accelerated
amortization of restricted shares in connection with the Separation.

In
connection with the Separation, we have initiated actions to reduce our corporate expense and are targeting a full year corporate expense run rate of $500 million by
mid-2008.

Corporate
expense in 2006 was $219 million lower than 2005. Corporate expense for 2006 included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment
obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting
from a reduction in our estimated workers' compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. These income items were partially offset by incremental stock option charges of
$47 million required under SFAS 123R, Separation related costs of $49 million and restructuring and divestiture charges of $2 million. On a comparative basis to 2005,
corporate expense in 2006 also benefited from lower Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs.

Corporate
expense for 2005 included a $50 million charge for fines and penalties paid to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as
well as a $70 million charge for estimated contingencies related to contested legal proceedings seeking to enforce retention agreements for five former executives.

Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was $102 million in 2007, as compared to $43 million and $39 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest
income in 2007 is primarily related to interest earned on the class action settlement escrow of $41 million.

Interest
expense was $313 million in 2007, as compared to $279 million in 2006 and $322 million in 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2007 is a result of
interest on the class action settlement liability of $41 million, partially offset by lower debt outstanding. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is
primarily driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program as compared to 2005.

The
weighted-average interest rate on total debt outstanding at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were 6.3%, 6.0% and 5.7%, respectively.


In
each period, net interest amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco
Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred and is reflected as discontinued operations. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate
on debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. The portion of Tyco's interest income allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $35 million, $53 million and
$43 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The portion of Tyco's interest expense allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $242 million, $378 million and
$433 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net was $255 million in 2007 and $296 million in 2005. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million
loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with the debt tender offers (see Note 13), for which no tax benefit is available. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and
the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing
operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations.

During
2005, other expense, net consisted primarily of losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity partially offset by a
$109 million court-ordered restitution award.

During
2005, the Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million
principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a $1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the
write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, with $405 included in continuing operations and $608 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued
operations.

Additionally,
in September 2005, we were awarded a total of $134 million as restitution in connection with our litigation against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and Director (together, the "Defendants"), as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The
restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the Defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and $25 million related to a
loan receivable from Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski which had been reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a receivable. During 2007, the Company received payment for these
amounts.

Income Taxes

Effective Income Tax Rate

The effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion and the loss on early
extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. Additionally, taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the Separation. Our effective income
tax rate was 27.3% and 4.7% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was primarily the result of a lower release of deferred tax asset valuation
allowances, increased profits in higher tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments to the tax accrual for legacy tax matters in 2005, partially offset by the loss on retirement of debt for which no
benefit was available in 2005.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $666 million and $800 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of


certain
deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related
to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
"

Accounting for Income Taxes

," which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion
of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential
liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the
issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs
Covidien's, Tyco Electronics' and Tyco's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if
any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes
within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the
Code.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, with certain exceptions, Tyco generally is responsible for the payment of 27% of any additional U.S. income taxes that are required to be paid to a U.S.
tax authority as a result of a U.S. tax audit of Covidien's, Tyco Electronics' or Tyco's subsidiaries' income tax returns for all periods prior to the spin-offs.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company shares responsibility for certain of Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods
prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments
made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally
among the parties. At September 28, 2007, Tyco has recorded a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $103 million reflected in other assets as our estimate of their portion of
the Tax Sharing obligations with an offset to shareholders' equity. Other liabilities include $543 million for the fair value of Tyco's obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, determined
in accordance with FIN 45 recognized with an offset to shareholders' equity.

Tyco
will provide payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the IRS audit process is completed for the
impacted years. Given the nature of the shared liabilities, the maximum amount of potential future payments is not determinable.

In
the event the Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party
responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result


thereof.
If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, then Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be responsible for 27%, 42%
and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its
own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the
Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law
for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share
of Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' tax liabilities. See Note 16 for further discussion of guarantees and indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and
other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded.

In
2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the 1997 through 2000 years, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax
returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during 2006, the Company developed proposed
amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of these adjustments is
probable and, accordingly, has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

The
Company has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002, which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of
the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002. When the Company's tax return positions are updated additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While
the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

During
the third quarter of 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and issued anticipated
Revenue Agents' Reports ("RARs") which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of the Company's
previously filed tax return positions, all of which the Company expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, the Company has made no additional provision during the year
ended September 28, 2007 as a result of the proposed audit adjustments in the RARs.

The
Company has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to the Company of $458 million, and during the third quarter of
2007, the Company paid $458 million, of which $163 million relates to the Company's discontinued operations. The Company


appealed
other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion, and, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend
its prior filed tax return positions. The Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its financial statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the ultimate
resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these
matters could result in the Company filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on the Company's
effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

Additionally,
the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection
with certain intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and
$50 million. The Company as Audit Managing Party will vigorously oppose the assertion of such penalties against Tyco Electronics, in part, because beginning in 2003 the Company discovered,
investigated and reported the conduct at issue to the IRS and fully cooperated in the criminal prosecution of the Company's former Chief Tax Officer on a charge of willful filing of a false tax
return.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as
such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of
distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional
income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

Discontinued Operations

During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco completed the Separation and has presented its Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all
periods presented.

The
Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the
balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the fourth quarter of 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders' equity, primarily related to the cash true-up
adjustment and other items, as specified in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, adjustments to certain pre-Separation tax liabilities, and the impact of filing final income tax returns in
certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and/or Tyco Electronics legal entities. Additional adjustments are not expected to be material and will be recorded
through shareholder's equity in subsequent periods as tax returns are finalized.

During
2007, AIJ, a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre-tax gain on sale of
$19 million was recorded. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have
been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Infrastructure Services provides consulting, engineering, construction management and operating services for the water, wastewater,
environmental, transportation and facilities market. The Company has assessed the recoverability of these businesses carrying values and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair
value, less cost to sell, until the businesses are sold. On September 17, 2007, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell for approximately


$295 million
in cash 100% of the stock of ETEO—Empresa de Transmissao de Energia do Oeste Ltda., a Brazilian subsidiary of Infrastructure Services. The transaction is subject
to Brazilian regulatory approval and normal closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company expects to sell the remaining portion of
Infrastructure Services by the end of fiscal 2008.

The
AIJ, Infrastructure Services, Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been
included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.

Losses on divestitures

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $4 million, $2 million and $23 million, respectively, of divestiture charges in continuing
operations in connection with the write-down to fair value, less cost to sell, of certain businesses. The fair value used for the impairment assessments was primarily based on the terms and conditions
included or expected to be included in the sales agreements.

Acquisitions

During 2007, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations, primarily within ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Flow Control, totaled
$31 million. Cash paid for acquisitions by businesses included in continuing operations during 2006 and 2005 totaled $5 million and $6 million, respectively.

These
acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tyco's consolidated results from the respective
acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Goodwill Impairment

In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 Tyco reorganized into a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these
organizational changes, the Company assessed new reporting units and conducted valuations to determine the assignment of goodwill to the new reporting units based on their estimated relative fair
values. Following the relative fair value goodwill allocation, the Company then tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value amount. If the
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. Where goodwill was potentially impaired, the Company compared the implied fair value of the
reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill in the Australia and New Zealand Security Services
business, part of the ADT Worldwide segment. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in the third quarter of 2007.

In
determining fair value, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and market place
data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Changes to these factors and judgments could result in impairment
to one or more of our reporting units in a future period. See Note 1.


Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "

Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

." FIN No. 47 clarifies the timing of liability recognition
for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the
entity and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 requires that conditional asset
retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be initially reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of
$32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets, of which $19 million and $5 million are reflected
in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $14 million after-tax loss
($22 million pre-tax), reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in
effect at the time.

During
2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30

th

to August 31

st

,
effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the
actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million
after-tax gain ($28 million pre-tax) cumulative effect of accounting change.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are
based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring-Related Assets

—Tyco generally considers assets related to the
acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems
(collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed
property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred
revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave
in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any
related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition.

Effective
as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily
in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight-line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The
accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts
to a straight-line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight-line method
with a 14-year life for non-pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer
termination.

The
change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent
factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The
pertinent factors have been influenced by management's ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the
credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. All pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the
estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful
lives.

Effective
as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the
net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to
account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the
installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by management's ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer
satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base.


Attrition
rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 12.3%, 14.2% and 15.0% on a trailing 12-month basis for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

—Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other
construction-related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract
revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in
long-term contracts. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the
period in which they become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated.

Product
discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Loss Contingencies

—Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and
other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external
legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Income Taxes

—In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These
estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences
between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international
pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a
change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves


in
light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our
current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts
ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer
necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill
recorded at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment
annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In
performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other
market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Since judgment
is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or
indefinite-lived intangible assets may be overstated.

We
elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. When testing for goodwill
impairment, the Company follows the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

" First, the Company compares the
fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed
to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the
reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying
amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The
Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.

Disruptions
to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a
significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting
units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.

Goodwill
impairments related to continuing operations were $46 million during 2007. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006 and 2005.

Long-Lived Assets

—Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable
intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs
undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at
the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long-lived
assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the
amount and


timing
of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of
long-lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may be overstated or understated.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

—Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical
assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other
assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial
assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit
obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase
our present value of pension obligations by approximately $90 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected
long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected
long-term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $10 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 28, 2007,
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions):

The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $405 million in 2007. The components of this change are set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The
significant changes in working capital included a $166 million increase in inventories, a $128 million increase in accounts receivable, and $244 million of changes in income
taxes, net, which includes a payment of legacy tax liabilities. Additionally, working capital includes the collection of $38 million related to restitution owed by Mark H. Swartz, former Chief
Financial Officer and Director, and $98 million related to the restitution owed by L. Dennis Kozlowski, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

During
the third quarter of 2007, Tyco entered into the class action settlement and borrowed under its unsecured bridge loan and revolving credit facilities to fund the
$2.992 billion liability, placing the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class.

During
2007, we completed the sale of the AIJ business for $42 million in net cash proceeds. Additionally, during 2007, we received $271 million due to the liquidation of
investments in a rabbi trust, as well as $136 million in restitution payments owed by former executives as described above.

We
continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards.
Capital spending increased to $669 million in 2007 from $558 million in 2006. The level of capital expenditures in 2008 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2007 and is also expected
to exceed depreciation.

In
September 2007, Tyco's Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which, we repurchased 1.3 million common shares for
$56 million. During the first quarter of 2007 we repurchased 5 million common shares for $659 million completing the $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the
Board of Directors in May 2006. This followed the repurchase of 13 million common shares for $1.3 billion in 2006. Additionally during 2006, we completed the $1.5 billion share
repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July of 2005 with the repurchase of 11 million common shares for $1.2 billion.

In
2006, we commenced the termination of our interest rate and cross currency swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges. During 2007, we terminated the remaining swaps. Such
terminations resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million.

During
the first quarter of 2007, we launched a $350 million to $400 million company-wide restructuring program. During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we paid out
$70 million, $32 million and $103 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information regarding our restructuring activities.

Income
taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations was $650 million in 2007, which included $295 million of legacy tax liability payments of amounts not
yet due to the IRS in respect of their examination of our 1997 through 2000 U.S. federal income tax returns (the ultimate resolution of which is uncertain).

During
2007, 2006 and 2005, Tyco paid $409 million, $373 million and $328 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 415,000, 401,000 and 364,000
customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.

During
2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid $10 million, $7 million and $14 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Holdback
liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 28, 2007 holdback
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $16 million, which are included in other liabilities. At September 28, 2007, $14 million of acquisition liabilities remained on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $4 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $10 million are included in other liabilities.


As
previously discussed, effective June 29, 2007, the Company completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we paid $349 million in Separation costs during
2007 and $96 million in 2006, including $256 million and $77 million, respectively, recorded in cash provided by discontinued operating activities. We expect that we will incur
the remaining cash outflows related to the Separation during the first six months of fiscal 2008. These amounts will primarily consist of tax restructuring, professional services and employee-related
costs.

Capitalization

Shareholders' equity was $15.6 billion or $31.50 per share, at September 28, 2007, compared to $35.4 billion or $71.06 per share, at
September 29, 2006. Shareholders' equity decreased $19.8 billion primarily due to the distribution of Covidien and Tyco Electronics to shareholders. This decrease was also due to net
loss of $1.7 billion, the repurchase of common shares by a subsidiary of $727 million, and
dividends declared of $668 million, offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $883 million.

In
connection with the Separation, as approved by our Board of Directors, we executed a reverse stock split, and as a result, four Tyco shares were converted into one share. Shareholder
approval was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders.

Our
debt levels decreased significantly as compared to September 29, 2006 primarily due to the debt tenders and Covidien and Tyco Electronics assuming their portion of related
borrowings. At September 28, 2007, total debt decreased $5.1 billion to $4.5 billion, as compared to $9.6 billion at September 29, 2006. Total debt as a percentage
of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders' equity) was 22% at September 28, 2007, which increased slightly as compared to 21% at September 29, 2006 due to the decrease in
shareholders' equity mentioned above. See

Debt Tenders

and

Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities

below
for further discussion.

Our
cash balance decreased to $1.9 billion at September 28, 2007, as compared to $2.2 billion at September 29, 2006. The decrease in cash was primarily due to
the debt repayments referred to above and the class action settlement escrow. These decreases were partially offset by cash flows provided by operations and transfers from discontinued operations.

As
previously discussed, in September 2007, the Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program. Pursuant to the program, we may repurchase Tyco
shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 trading plan in accordance with
applicable regulations. A Rule 10b5-1 trading plan permits the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when the Company would not normally be active in the trading market
due to insider trading laws, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information. Under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, we would be
unable to repurchase shares above a pre-determined price per share. Additionally, the maximum number of shares that we may purchase each day would be governed by
Rule 10b-18.

Dividend
payments were $791 million in 2007. On September 13, 2007 Tyco's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Company's common shares of $0.15 per share
payable on November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of
our common shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Bermuda law, our financial condition and
results of operations, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.


Debt Tenders

On April 27, 2007, we announced that, in connection with the Separation, we and certain of our subsidiaries that are issuers of our corporate debt had
commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of our outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt, aggregating approximately $6.6 billion. Of this amount, approximately
$5.9 billion was non-convertible U.S. debt and $750 million was convertible U.S. debt, with maturities from 2007 to 2029. In conjunction with the tender offers, the relevant
issuer solicited consents for certain clarifying amendments to the indentures pursuant to which the debt was issued. We received acceptance notices for approximately $2.1 billion, or 36% of our
outstanding non-convertible U.S. debt and approximately $726 million or 97% of our outstanding convertible U.S. debt. Debt which was not tendered in an amount of approximately
$3.8 billion remains with us.

Additionally,
Tyco International Group S.A., our wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), commenced on April 30, 2007 tender offers to purchase
for cash all of its outstanding Euro and Pound Sterling denominated public debt, aggregating the equivalent of approximately $1.9 billion, with maturities from 2008 to 2031, issued under its
Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the "EMTN Notes") and a consent solicitation for certain clarifying amendments to the fiscal agency agreement pursuant to which the EMTN Notes were issued. We received
acceptance notices for approximately $1.5 billion, or 80% of our EMTN Notes. The remaining EMTN Notes were repurchased pursuant to an optional redemption.

In
connection with the debt tender offers, we incurred a pre-tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $647 million, for which no tax benefit is
available (see Note 5).

TIGSA's
remaining debt was contributed to Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to TIGSA.

Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities

On April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three 364-day unsecured bridge loan facilities with an
aggregate commitment amount of $10 billion. At the end of May 2007, the aggregate commitment amount under these facilities was increased to $12.5 billion. We borrowed
approximately $8.9 billion under the unsecured bridge loan facilities to fund our debt tender offers, repay our existing bank credit facilities and to finance the class action settlement. Of
this amount, approximately $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion was assigned to Covidien and Tyco Electronics, respectively. We initially guaranteed the new unsecured bridge loan facilities and
Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed Tyco's obligations with respect to their unsecured bridge
loan facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on
changes in our credit rating. As of September 28, 2007, our aggregate commitment under our unsecured bridge loan facility was $4.0 billion and $367 million remained outstanding
with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.5%.

On
October 1, 2007, the commitments with respect to the unused portion of our unsecured bridge loan facility expired. Our unsecured revolving credit facility described below and
our letter of credit facility described in

Commitments and Contingencies—Contractual Obligations

, provide the lenders under those facilities
with the right to demand repayment of outstanding amounts, and to terminate commitments to extend additional credit, if (i) certain of our outstanding public debt is declared due and payable
and (ii) we do not have sufficient liquidity available under our unsecured bridge loan facility to refinance such debt. As a result, on November 27, 2007, we secured additional firm
commitments from certain of our lenders under the bridge loan facility. These additional commitments provide us with sufficient liquidity to repay the outstanding public debt with borrowings of up to


$4.0 billion.
The additional commitments expire on, and any borrowings under the facility would mature on, November 25, 2008. The facility may only be used to repay, settle or otherwise
extinguish the public debt described above, which is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and The Bank of New York. For more information regarding such litigation, see Item 3. Legal
Proceedings—Indenture Trustee Litigation.

Additionally,
on April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three unsecured revolving credit facilities with an initial aggregate
commitment amount of $2.5 billion that increased to $4.25 billion at the time of the Separation. Of the aggregate commitment amount of $4.25 billion, a $1.25 billion
commitment is available to us, and a $1.5 billion commitment was available to each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics. We will use the revolving credit facilities for working capital, capital
expenditures and other corporate purposes. We initially guaranteed the new revolving credit facilities and Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed our obligations with respect to their revolving
credit facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. At September 28, 2007, we have borrowed $308 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on changes in our credit rating.

The
unsecured revolving credit facilities replaced TIGSA's existing $1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion 3-year revolving
bank credit facility, which were terminated by June 1, 2007 prior to their scheduled expiration dates of December 16, 2009 and December 21, 2007, respectively. On the date of
termination, no amounts were borrowed under these facilities.

TIFSA's
bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and
sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. We believe we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. The Bank of New York, as indenture
trustee under indentures dated as of June 9, 1998 and November 12, 2003, is contesting whether the Separation transactions were permitted under such indentures. See Item 3. Legal
Proceedings—Indenture Trustee Litigation.

Other
long-term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and
are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our
pension plans are expected to be approximately $69 million in 2008 and we expect to pay $7 million in 2008 related to postretirement benefit plans.

At September 28, 2007, TIFSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.25 billion due April 25, 2012, of which approximately
$0.9 billion was undrawn and available (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Company's operating subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft and
similar types of facilities, which total $55 million, of which $51 million was undrawn and available.
These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2009, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations.

On
June 21, 2007, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a new $500 million letter of credit facility, with Citibank N.A. as administrative agent, expiring on December 15,
2007. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIFSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for
obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to the covenants under the bridge loan and revolving credit
facilities. TIFSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the bank's base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. As of September 28, 2007,
letters of credit of $494 million have been issued under the $500 million credit facility and $6 million remains available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this
credit facility at September 28, 2007. On October 19, 2007, the facility was amended. The amendment extended the maturity date to June 15, 2008 and adjusted the interest rate
spreads and fees applicable to extensions of credit thereunder. Loans under the amended letter of credit agreement will continue to bear interest based on LIBOR plus the applicable margin.

At
September 28, 2007, the Company had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $1.1 billion.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain class actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Subject
to the


terms
and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation
and Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations.

Tyco
has assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre-Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include
securities class action litigation, ERISA class action litigation, certain legacy tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin-offs or the distributions made or brought by
any third party except for litigation related to our public debt. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin-offs that are subject
to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. As described in the Separation
and Distribution Agreement, Tyco, Tyco Electronics and Covidien are jointly and severally liable for all amounts relating
to the previously disclosed securities class action settlement. All costs and expenses that Tyco incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or
settlement, which will be allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Covidien, Tyco Electronics and Tyco.

Legal Matters

Class Actions

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's securities class actions, class action settlement, securities class action proceedings, shareholder
derivative litigation, ERISA related litigation, Tyco litigation against former senior management, litigation related to our public debt and various other legal matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda
law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. While we may from time to time
seek to engage plaintiff's counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to
pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Investigations

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Subpoenas and
Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we
will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government entities or instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively
impact our business with non-governmental customers) or suffer other penalties or adverse impacts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to
estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Environmental Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's environmental matters, see Item 1. Business—Environmental Matters.


Asbestos Matters

Tyco and some of its subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries of Covidien are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to
asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien has assumed all liabilities for pending cases filed against Covidien's subsidiaries. Consistent with the
national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. A limited number of the cases allege premises
liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of
past distribution of heat-resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-containing gaskets or packing. Each
case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants.

Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these
claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuits that have been filed against it and its subsidiaries. To date, the
Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle
and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 28, 2007, there were approximately 5,600 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.

The
Company estimates its pending asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Company's estimate of the
liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has
adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes
that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes

Tyco and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities,
including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other
tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's income taxes, see
Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Income Tax Matters.

Compliance Matters

Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. As
previously reported, we have been informed that two subsidiaries in our Flow Control business in Italy have been named in a request for criminal charges filed by the Milan public prosecutor's office.
Tyco has reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and
the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act ("FCPA"), that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and
will continue to communicate with the DOJ


and
SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by
the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. Covidien and Tyco Electronics agreed, in connection with the Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its response to these
allegations. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters and
other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution
of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's compliance matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Compliance Matters.

Other Matters

The Company is a party to a contract dispute arising from Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for the expansion of the City's

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. Both Earth Tech and the City of Phoenix have filed lawsuits in the local county superior court alleging the other party has breached the
contract. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution
of this matter. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's other matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Other Matters.

The
Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the
outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Backlog

At September 28, 2007, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.1 billion, compared to a backlog of $8.2 billion at September 29,
2006. We expect that approximately 86% of our backlog at September 28, 2007 will be filled during 2008. Backlog by segment at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 is as
follows ($ in millions):



ADT Worldwide

$

6,137

$

5,776

Fire Protection Services

1,050

Flow Control

1,579

1,115

Safety Products



Electrical and Metal Products



Corporate and Other



$

9,085

$

8,178

Within ADT Worldwide, backlog increased primarily as a result of strong bookings across all regions. Backlog for ADT Worldwide also includes
recurring revenue-in-force, which represents 12 months' fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring
revenue-in-force at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was $3.93 billion and $3.65 billion, respectively. Backlog within Fire Protection
Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders in North America. Flow Control had increased bookings mostly in the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sale of Accounts Receivable

Certain of Tyco's international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short-term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount
outstanding under the Company's remaining international accounts receivable programs was $76 million, $75 million and $79 million at September 28, 2007,
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2008 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax
Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others.

" Fair values were determined with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of these guarantees and
indemnifications is $543 million, which is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in
the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 16 for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement.

In
addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the
Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the
Separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining support. The estimated fair values of those obligations are $7 million, which are included in other liabilities with an offset
to shareholders' equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were recorded in accordance with FIN No. 45.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business—Environmental Matters for a
discussion of these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In
2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of
certain O-ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tyco's acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of
charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the
program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Company's obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge
which was reflected in cost of sales. On May 1, 2007, the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Company announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in
the VRP. The Company will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company further assessed the
expected cost to complete the program in light of the most current claims data and determined that an additional accrual of $10 million was necessary to satisfy the estimated remaining
obligation. The ultimate cost to complete the program will be impacted by a number of factors such as changes in material and labor costs, and the actual number of sprinkler heads replaced. Actual
results could differ from this estimate. Settlements during 2007 include cash expenditures of $38 million related to the VRP.

Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
"

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R)

." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability
on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized
as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a
measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 are
effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of
September 28, 2007. The Company recognized a net $111 million liability through a reduction in shareholders' equity.

In
September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

." SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual approach" in assessing the quantitative effects of financial
statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is effective for Tyco in fiscal 2007. The implementation
of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on Tyco's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 159, "

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

." SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a
contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather
than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.


The
Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "

Fair Value Measurements

," which enhances existing guidance for measuring
assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
is effective for Tyco beginning in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently implementing and assessing the
expected impact of adopting FIN No. 48. Based on the assessment to date, management does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the results of its operations, financial
position or cash flows.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the ordinary course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the
principal exposures we assume. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include
forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt
obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non-functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost
effective to do so.

We
do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor
its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there
is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party.

During
fiscal year 2007, the Company elected to change its presentation of market risk information from a tabular format to a disclosure based on the results of sensitivity analysis.
Management believes this method of presentation provides more useful information for assessing the Company's overall exposure to market risks. The results of our sensitivity analysis represent an
estimate of reasonably possible outcomes based on hypothetical market conditions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results. Although, there were no material changes in our primary risk
exposures and risk management activities, our level of exposure decreased across all risk categories as a result of the spin-off of our Healthcare and Electronics businesses.


Foreign Currency Exposures

We economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and options. During 2007, our largest
exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. The market risk related to the
forward foreign exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to
perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 28, 2007. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a
$248 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a
$303 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying
transactions.

Previously,
we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company
determined that it will no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long-term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
such investments were recorded in the income statement subsequent to this determination rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders' equity. Forward contracts that were
previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges.

Also
in connection with the Separation and the debt tender, the Company de-designated its 6.125% Euro denominated public notes due 2007 on March 29, 2007, its 5.5% Euro
denominated public notes due 2008 and its 6.5% British Pound denominated public notes due 2031 on May 21, 2007, that had previously been considered as hedges of net investments in certain
foreign operations. At September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its net investment in foreign operations, and all of its outstanding borrowings were denominated in U.S. dollars.

Interest Rate Exposures

Our long-term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed-rate instruments. Historically, the Company managed its exposure to interest rates by entering into
interest rate and cross-currency swaps designated as fair value hedges. In assessing the potential risks related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross-currency
swaps in several tranches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion,
resulting in an aggregate terminated notional amount of $3.1 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million for the first quarter of 2007. Since the
interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the
remaining life of the related debt instruments. In connection with the debt tender offer, $9 million of unamortized loss on interest rate swaps was accelerated and recorded as a loss on
retirement of debt and included in other expense, net (see Note 13). At September 28, 2007 there were no interest rate swaps outstanding.

Commodity Exposures

We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage
those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. At September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in
commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of September 28, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, relating to
accounting for income taxes, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures.


Over the past five years, significant internal control, informational systems and process improvements have been implemented in our tax accounting processes, including certain recently
implemented controls in response to the identified material weakness. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the following significant changes were made to our internal controls over financial
reporting:

•

Hired
additional experienced personnel to augment tax accounting resources;

•

Implemented
enhanced review and analytical procedures to evaluate accuracy of various tax accounts;

•

Improved
process for gathering and reviewing tax jurisdictional information; and

•

Strengthened
the organizational linkage between the Tax department and the Controller's group, and substantially improved communication and information flows between the two
teams.

While
progress has been made, several new tax accounting and control procedures have only recently been implemented and our current environment is still characterized by a highly complex
structure of approximately 1,200 legal entities. In light of this, the Company believes the material weakness relating to accounting for income taxes has not been remediated and the Company plans to
implement further improvements to achieve appropriate levels of controls, reliability and sustainability in this area.

In
addition to the above, we continue to proactively identify opportunities for control improvements. We have ongoing initiatives to standardize, consolidate and upgrade various
financial operating systems and eliminate many of the manual and redundant tasks previously performed under older systems or processes. These changes will be implemented in stages over the next
several years.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the Company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Management's
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit


Committee
of our Board of Directors. Based on our assessment, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as a result of a material weakness related to certain
aspects of accounting for income taxes as of September 28, 2007.

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have determined that further improvements are required in our tax
accounting processes before we can consider the material weakness remediated. Management's procedures and testing identified errors that, although not material to the consolidated financial
statements, led management to conclude that control deficiencies exist related to tax effecting consolidating entries, analysis and reconciliation of
taxes receivable and taxes payable in non-U.S. jurisdictions, certain aspects of deferred taxes, and procedures with respect to classification of tax amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. As a
result of these deficiencies, it is reasonably possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not have prevented or detected errors from occurring that could have been material, either
individually or in the aggregate.

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2007, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited
and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, and their report is also included in this Form 10-K.

November 27,

Remediation Plan

Over the next year, we will continue to focus on our internal controls over accounting for income taxes, and will take further steps to those mentioned earlier to
strengthen controls, including the following planned actions:

•

Further
enhancements to policies and procedures relating to tax account reconciliation and analysis;

•

Additional
hiring of tax accounting resources;

•

Training,
guidance and communications to information providers regarding tax accounting requirements;

•

Comprehensive
review of our tax accounting process and close procedures to identify areas that require further improvements; and

•

Enhanced
monitoring of tax accounting submissions and tax account balances of our legal entities globally.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discussion of Management's Responsibility

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in this report.
We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to being recognized as a leader in governance, controls, clarity and transparency of financial statements. We are committed to making
honesty, integrity and transparency the hallmarks of how we run Tyco. We believe that to succeed in today's environment requires more than just compliance with laws and regulations—it
requires a culture based upon the highest levels of integrity and ethical values. Expected behavior starts with our Board of Directors and our senior team leading by example and includes every one of
Tyco's 118,000 global employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and business partners. One of our most crucial objectives is continuing to maintain and build on the public, employee and
shareholder confidence that has been restored in Tyco. We believe this is being accomplished; first, by issuing financial information and related disclosures that are accurate, complete and
transparent so investors are well informed; second, by supporting a leadership culture based on an ethic of uncompromising integrity and accountability; and third, by recruiting, training and
retaining high-performance individuals who have the highest ethical standards. We take full responsibility for meeting this objective. We maintain appropriate accounting standards, and
disclosure controls and devote our full commitment and the necessary resources to these items.

Dedication to Governance, Controls and Financial Reporting

Throughout 2007, we continued to maintain and enhance internal controls over financial reporting, disclosures and corporate governance practices. We believe that
a strong control environment is a dynamic process. Therefore, we intend to continue to devote the necessary resources to maintain and improve our internal controls and corporate governance.

Our
Audit Committee meets regularly and separately with management, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors, and our internal auditors to discuss financial reports,
controls and auditing.

We,
our Board and our Audit Committee are all committed to excellence in governance, financial reporting and controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 28, 2007 and September 29,
2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2007. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries as of
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2007, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements: i) the Company changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system
assets and related deferred revenue from the straight-line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an
accelerated method with lives up to 15 years effective as of the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2007, and ii) the Company adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

effective September 28, 2007.

As
discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements: i) the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

effective September 29,
2006, and ii) the Company changed the measurement date of its pension and post retirement plans from September 30 to August 31 in fiscal year 2005.

As
discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, effective October 1, 2005.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 28, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 27, 2007 expressed an adverse opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting because of a material
weakness.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.

We
have audited Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries' (the "Company's") internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2007 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on that risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's
assessment:

The
Company did not maintain effective internal controls over accounting for income taxes. Control deficiencies existed related to tax effecting consolidating entries, analysis and reconciliation of
taxes receivable and taxes payable in non-U.S. jurisdictions, certain aspects of deferred taxes, and procedures with respect to classification of tax amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The
design and operation of procedural and monitoring controls may not have


prevented
or detected, errors from occurring that could have been material, either individually or in the aggregate.

This
material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007, of the Company and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements and financial statement schedule.

In
our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and
for the year ended September 28, 2007 of the Company and our report dated November 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph noting that i) the Company changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets
and related deferred revenue from the straight-line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years effective as of the beginning of the
fiscal third quarter of 2007 and ii) the Company adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R)

2007, the record date. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.25 of a common share of each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for each Tyco common share held on the record date. Tyco shareholders received
cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts of less than one Covidien or Tyco Electronics common share. The distribution was structured to be tax-free to Tyco shareholders except to the
extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. While we are a party to Separation and Distribution, Tax Sharing and certain other agreements, we have determined that there is no significant
continuing involvement between us and Covidien or Tyco Electronics as discussed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

," and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 03-13, "

Applying the
Conditions of Paragraph 42 of SFAS No. 144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations

." Therefore, we have classified Covidien and Tyco Electronics
as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

Additionally,
on the distribution date, the Company, as approved by its Board of Directors, effected a reverse stock split of Tyco's common shares, at a split ratio of one for four.
Shareholder approval for the reverse stock split was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders. Share and per share data for all periods presented have been adjusted
to reflect the reverse stock split.

During
2007 and 2006, the Company incurred pre-tax costs related to the Separation of $1,083 million and $169 million, respectively. The costs include loss on
early extinguishment of debt, debt refinancing, tax restructuring, professional services and employee-related costs. Of this amount, $105 million and $49 million is included in
separation costs, $259 million in 2007 related to loss on early extinguishment of debt is included in other expense, net and $719 million and $120 million is included in
discontinued operations, respectively. Additionally, 2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write-off of deferred tax assets that will no longer be
realizable of $183 million, of which $95 million is included in income taxes and $88 million is included in discontinued operations.

In
connection with the Separation, the Company has realigned its management and segment reporting structure. See Note 21.

During
the first quarter of 2007, we sold Aguas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services. Additionally, during the fourth
quarter of 2007, the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Principles of Consolidation

—Tyco is a holding company which conducts its business through its operating subsidiaries. The
Company consolidates companies in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or has the ability to control through similar rights. Also, the Company consolidates variable
interest entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities' expected losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns. All intercompany transactions
have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of
disposal.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant
estimates in these Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring charges, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows associated with asset impairments,
useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, fair values of financial instruments, estimated contract revenue and related costs, legal
liabilities, income taxes and tax valuation allowances, and pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company recognizes revenue principally on four types of transactions—sales of products,
sales of security systems, billings for monitoring and maintenance services and contract sales.

Revenue
from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass. This is generally when the products reach the
free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Provisions
for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in determining sales in the same period the
related sales are recorded. These provisions are based on terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Sales
of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. Amounts assigned to each component of
the arrangement are based on that component's objectively determined fair value. If fair value cannot be objectively determined for a sale involving multiple elements, the Company recognizes the
revenue from installation of services, along with the associated direct incremental costs, over the contract life.

Revenue
from the sale of services is recognized as services are rendered. Customer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are
rendered and the associated deferred revenue is included in current liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

Contract
sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction-related projects are recorded primarily under the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The
extent of progress toward completion is generally measured


based
on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost at completion. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period.
Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Estimated warranty costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the
construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting.

At
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, accounts receivable and other long-term receivables included retainage provisions of $63 million in both
years of which $41 million and $36 million are unbilled, respectively. These retainage provisions consist primarily of fire protection contracts and become due upon contract completion
and acceptance. At September 28, 2007 the retainage provision included $62 million, that is expected to be collected during 2008.

Research and Development

—Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of product
sales. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred and building and overhead expenses. See Note 22.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. See
Note 22.

Translation of Foreign Currency

—For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that account in a functional currency
other than U.S. dollars, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect
during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including the impact of our foreign currency derivatives, reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses were
$60 million, $77 million and $21 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—All highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the time of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses
inherent in Tyco's receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

—Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market
value.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

—Property, plant and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $638 million, $665 million and $676 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when
incurred. Except for pooled subscriber systems, depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Subscriber systems

Accelerated method up to 15 years

Other machinery, equipment and furniture and fixtures

2 to 20 years


See
below for discussion of depreciation method and estimated useful lives related to subscriber systems.

Subscriber System Assets and Related Deferred Revenue Accounts

—The Company generally considers assets related to the
acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial
subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets
include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and
any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers
that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system
assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition.

Effective
as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily
in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight-line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The
accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts
to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight-line method with a
14-year life for non-pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination.

The
change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent
factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The
pertinent factors have been influenced by management's ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the
credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. In accordance with SFAS No. 154, "

Accounting Changes and Error Correction,"

the change in
method used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue accounts represents a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and is
accounted for prospectively. The change in method is based on information obtained by continued observation of the expected benefits inherent in the pooled subscriber system assets by customer
category and is preferable, as it results in depreciation and amortization that are more reflective of the pattern of expected benefits derived from these assets. All pertinent factors, including
actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed
by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives.


The effects of the change described above decreased net revenue by $21 million, decreased depreciation expense by $37 million, and decreased loss from continuing operations
and net loss by $10 million each and increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.02 for 2007.

Long-Lived Assets

—Tyco reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and
amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs
undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at
the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to
be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment
annually and more frequently if triggering events occur (see Note 11). In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans,
economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the
analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The Company performed its annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on the first day of
the fourth quarter of 2007.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, the Company first compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares
the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that
the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including
intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities
represents the implied fair value of goodwill.

Dealer and Other Amortizable Intangible Assets, Net

—Intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer
relationships and intellectual property. Certain contracts and related
customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. Acquired contracts and
related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price.

During
the first six months (twelve months in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from
customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a
reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset.

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program described above are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and
pattern of


economic
benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the estimated useful life of dealer
intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on
an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition
data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by management's ongoing customer retention programs, as well as
tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. In accordance with SFAS No. 154, the change in
estimated useful life of dealer intangibles is accounted for prospectively. The effect of the change in estimated useful life for dealer intangibles decreased loss from continuing operations and net
loss by $6 million each and increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.01 for 2007.

Other
contracts and related customer relationships, as well as intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology, are amortized on a
straight-line basis over four to forty years. The Company evaluates the amortization methods and remaining useful lives of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events
and circumstances warrant a revision to the amortization method or remaining useful lives.

Investments

—The Company invests in debt and equity securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity
securities that represent less than twenty percent ownership are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to other comprehensive
income within shareholders' equity for available for sale securities unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management
determines the proper classification of investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and
reevaluates such classifications as of each balance sheet date.
Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other
equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. Each reporting period, the Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that
they are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For equity investments in which the Company exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not
control, the equity method of accounting is used. The Company's share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and was not material in any
period presented.

Product Warranty

—The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. Manufactured products are warranted
against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Generally, product warranties are implicit in the sale;
however, the customer may purchase an extended warranty. Manufactured equipment is also warranted in the same manner as product warranties. However, in most instances the warranty is either negotiated
in the contract or sold as a separate component. Warranty period terms range from 90 days (e.g., various products) up to 15 years (e.g., pressure reducers and floor heating products).
The warranty liability is determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain
instances estimated property damage.


Environmental Costs

—Tyco is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Tyco provides for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Income Taxes

—Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities
and operating loss carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based
upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Insurable Liabilities

—The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities.
The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial
valuations based upon historical claims experience. Certain insurable
liabilities are discounted using a risk-free rate of return when the pattern and timing of the future obligation is reliably determinable. The impact of the discount on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was to reduce the obligation by $38 million and $47 million, respectively. The Company maintains captive
insurance companies to manage certain of its insurable liabilities. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Financial Instruments

—The Company may use interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward and option contracts to manage risks
generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk. Derivatives used for hedging purposes are designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception
of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract are highly correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge over the
life of the hedge contract.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet
items are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are included
in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income to the extent they are effective. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. The ineffective portion of all hedges, if any, is recognized
currently in earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings.

Share Premium and Contributed Surplus

—In accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, when Tyco issues shares for cash at a
premium to their par value, the resulting premium is credited to a share premium account, a non-distributable reserve. Contributed surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a
distributable reserve.

Reclassifications

—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. In 2007, the
Company presented proceeds from the divestiture of businesses classified as discontinued operations within net cash used in discontinued investing activities. Such proceeds were


$71 million,
$866 million and $158 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No. 158, "

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the
funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax,
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are
required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal
2009. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of September 28, 2007. The Company recognized a net $111 million liability through a
reduction in shareholders' equity.

In
September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "

Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

." SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual approach" in assessing
the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is effective for
Tyco in fiscal 2007. The implementation of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on Tyco's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 159, "

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

." SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a
contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather
than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company
is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "

Fair Value Measurements

," which enhances existing guidance for measuring
assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
is effective for Tyco beginning in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
The Company is currently implementing and assessing the expected impact of adopting FIN No. 48. Based on the assessment to


date,
management does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.

2.    Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

Discontinued Operations

During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco completed the Separation and has presented its Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all
periods presented.

In
each period prior to the Separation, net interest and loss on early extinguishment of debt, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations,
amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that Tyco believes were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts
directly incurred. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted-average interest rate on debt including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. These allocated amounts were
included in discontinued operations. During 2007, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $35 million, $242 million and $388 million, respectively.
During 2006, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $53 million, $378 million and $0 million, respectively. During 2005, allocated interest income,
interest expense and other expense, net was $43 million, $433 million and $608 million, respectively.

The
Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the
balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the fourth quarter of 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders' equity, primarily related to the cash true-up
adjustment and other items, as specified in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, adjustments to certain pre-Separation tax
liabilities, and the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and/or Tyco Electronics legal entities. Additional
adjustments are not expected to be material and will be recorded through shareholder's equity in subsequent periods as tax returns are finalized.

During
2007, AIJ, a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre-tax gain on sale of
$19 million was recorded. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have
been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Infrastructure Services provides consulting, engineering, construction management and operating services for the water, wastewater,
environmental, transportation and facilities market. The Company has assessed the recoverability of these businesses carrying values and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair
value, less cost to sell, until the businesses are sold. On September 17, 2007, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell for approximately $295 million in cash 100% of the
stock of ETEO—Empresa de Transmissao de Energia do Oeste Ltda., a Brazilian subsidiary of Infrastructure Services. The transaction is subject to Brazilian regulatory approval and
normal closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company expects to sell the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services by the end of fiscal
2008.

The
AIJ, Infrastructure Services, Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been
included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.

2007 Charges and Credits

During the first quarter of 2007, the Company launched a restructuring program across the segments including the corporate organization which will streamline some
of the businesses and reduce the operational footprint. The Company expects to incur charges related to the program of approximately $350 million to $400 million through the end of 2008.

The
restructuring program includes numerous actions which are designed to improve operating efficiency and strengthen the Company's competitive position in the future. To date, many of
the actions initiated relate to improving field efficiencies and consolidating certain administrative functions in the European operations of ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. In addition,
Corporate consolidated certain headquarter functions. The restructuring actions were largely reductions in workforce and are expected to be completed by the end of 2008.

Net
restructuring and asset impairment charges during 2007 were $217 million, which include $7 million reflected in cost of sales for the non-cash write down in
carrying value of inventory. The
remaining charge is comprised of restructuring charges of $199 million, which include $183 million of employee severance and benefits and $16 million of facility exit charges and
other cash charges, and $15 million of asset impairments. During 2007, the Company completed restructuring activities announced in prior years for amounts less than originally estimated, and
accordingly reversed $4 million of restructuring reserves as a restructuring credit.

During
2007, the Company paid $59 million related to actions initiated in 2007 and has $127 million accrued related to these actions as of September 28, 2007.

2006 Charges and Credits

During 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $13 million, which includes $11 million of employee severance
and benefits and $2 million of asset impairments. The restructuring charges related to several restructuring actions and facility exit plans which were initiated in 2006 for $16 million
as well as costs incurred in 2006 related to actions initiated prior to 2006 for $2 million. During 2006, the Company completed restructuring activities announced in prior years for amounts
less than originally estimated, and accordingly reversed $7 million of restructuring reserves. Most of the restructuring initiatives undertaken during 2006 as well as actions taken in prior
periods, which impact restructuring charges incurred during 2006, relate to the ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments.

Through
2007, the Company paid $14 million related to these actions and has $1 million accrued as of September 28, 2007.

2005 Charges and Credits

During 2005, the Company recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $18 million, including $1 million reflected in cost of sales for the
non-cash write down in carrying value of inventory. The remaining charge is comprised of restructuring charges of $28 million, which includes $13 million of employee
severance and benefits, $11 million of facility exit charges and $4 million of other charges. These charges related to several restructuring actions and facility exit plans which were
initiated in 2005 as well as incremental costs incurred in 2005 related to actions initiated during 2004. Of these charges, $13 million related to actions initiated and completed in 2005 while
the remaining $15 million related to actions which commenced prior to 2005. During 2005, the Company completed restructuring activities announced in prior years for amounts less than originally
estimated, and accordingly reversed $11 million of restructuring reserves as a restructuring credit.

The
2005 restructuring initiatives were largely a result of actions taken by Flow Control, Safety Products and ADT Worldwide segments which incurred employee severance and benefits of
$4 million, $3 million and $3 million, respectively. Through 2007, the Company has substantially paid these obligations and has less than $1 million accrued as of
September 28, 2007.


2004 and Prior Charges and Credits

The Company continues to maintain restructuring reserves related to certain actions initiated prior to 2005. The total amount of these reserves are
$21 million and $30 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively. These balances primarily include facility exit costs for long-term
non-cancelable lease obligations within the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, with expiration dates which range from 2008 to 2022.

ADT Dealer Program

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Tyco paid $409 million, $373 million and $328 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 415,000,
401,000 and 364,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.


5.    Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net was $255 million in 2007 and $296 million in 2005. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million
loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with the debt tender offers (see Note 13), for which no tax benefit is available. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and
the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing
operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations.

During
2005, other expense, net consisted primarily of losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity, partially offset by a
$109 million court-ordered restitution award.

During
2005, the Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million
principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a $1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the
write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, with $405 included in continuing operations and $608 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued
operations.

Additionally,
in September 2005, we were awarded a total of $134 million as restitution in connection with our litigation against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and Director. The restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed
compensation made to the Defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and $25 million related to a loan receivable from Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski which had been reflected
in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a receivable. During 2007, the Company received payment for these amounts.

Included in the nondeductible charges for 2007 is the class action settlement, net of $2.862 billion. Additionally, the nondeductible
charges include $105 million associated with Separation costs which were not fully deductible as well as a write-off of deferred tax assets in entities that were liquidated as part
of the Separation. The loss on retirement of debt includes charges related to the early extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. The valuation allowance
benefit includes a tax impact of $72 million associated with identification of tax planning to ensure realization of certain deferred tax assets as well as a net benefit of $51 million
associated with changes in valuation allowances driven primarily by increased profitability in certain jurisdictions.

Included
in the loss on retirement of debt in 2006 is a cumulative one-time benefit associated with the receipt of a favorable tax ruling in the fourth quarter of 2006
permitting the deduction of prior year debt retirement costs not previously benefited. This benefit is partially offset by a valuation allowance on the net operating losses created by the debt
retirement deductions.


Deferred
income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net

At September 28, 2007, the Company had $3,584 million of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S.
jurisdictions. Of these, $2,581 million have no expiration, and the remaining $1,003 million will expire in future years through 2027. Due to a favorable tax ruling in the fourth quarter
of 2006, the Company was able to recognize $98 million of net operating loss carryforwards associated with deduction of debt retirement costs. In the U.S., there were approximately
$1,292 million of federal and $1,715 million of state net operating loss carryforwards at September 28, 2007, which will expire in future years through 2027.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $666 million and $800 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate
sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 109, "

Accounting for Income Taxes

," which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not"
that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. At September 28, 2007, approximately $123 million of the valuation allowance will ultimately reduce goodwill if the net
operating losses are utilized.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. See "Income Taxes" in Note 16.


The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the
complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has
reviewed with tax counsel certain of the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the
ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in
income tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments
are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are
distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis
differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

See
"Income Taxes" in Note 16 for information related to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Covidien and Tyco Electronics.

7.    Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During 2006, the Company adopted FIN No. 47,

"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an Interpretation
of FASB Statement No. 143."

FIN No. 47 clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and
(or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement
costs, be initially reported
at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the
related assets, of which $19 million and $5 million are reflected in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative
effect of accounting change of $14 million after-tax loss ($22 million pre-tax), reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been
recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time.

During
2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30

th

to August 31

st

,
effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the
actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated


Financial
Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million after-tax gain ($28 million
pre-tax) cumulative effect of accounting change.

8.    Earnings Per Share

As discussed in Note 1, the Company effected a reverse stock split of Tyco's common shares, at a split ratio of one for four. Share and per share data for
all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.

The
reconciliations between basic and diluted earnings per share for 2007, and 2006 and 2005 are as follows ($ in millions, except per share data):

The computation of diluted earnings per share prior to the Separation, includes the impact of equity instruments which were converted to give
effect to the distribution, in 2007, 2006 and 2005 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of options to purchase approximately 29 million, 21 million and 18 million shares,
respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Additionally, the
computation of diluted earnings per common share for 2007 excludes the impact of convertible debt of approximately 6 million shares because the effect would be anti-dilutive.

The
computation of diluted earnings per share in 2007 excludes restricted share awards and deferred stock units of approximately 5 million because the effect would be
anti-dilutive. The computation of diluted earnings per share in 2006 and 2005 excludes restricted share awards of approximately 2 million and 1 million, respectively, because
the effect would be anti-dilutive.

9.    Sale of Accounts Receivable

Certain of Tyco's international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short-term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount
outstanding under the Company's remaining international accounts receivable programs was $76 million, $75 million and $79 million at September 28, 2007,
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.

10.    Investments

At September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, Tyco had available-for-sale investments with a fair market value of
$352 million and $334 million and a cost basis of $352 million and $337 million,


respectively.
These investments consist primarily of debt securities and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
September 28, 2007, $117 million of these debt securities were due to mature within one year, with the remainder substantially due in one to five years. The unrealized gains and losses
related to these investments are immaterial and have been included as a separate component of shareholders' equity.

11.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 Tyco reorganized into a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these
organizational changes, the Company assessed new reporting units and conducted valuations to determine the assignment of goodwill to the
new reporting units based on their estimated relative fair values. Following the relative fair value goodwill allocation, the Company then tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of
each reporting unit with its carrying value amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. Where goodwill was potentially
impaired, the Company compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of
goodwill in the Australia and New Zealand Security Services business, part of the ADT Worldwide segment. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in the third
quarter of 2007.

In
determining fair value, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and market place
data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Changes to these factors and judgments could result in impairment
to one or more of our reporting units in a future period. See Note 1.

There
were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006 and 2005.

12.    Related Party Transactions

The Company has amounts due related to loans and advances issued to employees in prior years under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, relocation programs
and other advances made to executives. Loans were provided to employees under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, which is now discontinued, except for outstanding loans for the payment of taxes
upon the vesting of shares granted under our Restricted Share Ownership Plans. No loans are outstanding to any of our current executives. The loans are not collateralized and bear interest, payable
annually, at a rate based on the six-month LIBOR, calculated annually as the average of the rates in effect on the first day of each of the preceding 12 months. Loans are generally
repayable in ten years; however, earlier payments are required under certain circumstances, such as when an employee is terminated. In addition, the Company made mortgage loans to certain employees
under employee relocation programs. These loans are generally payable in 15 years and are collateralized by the underlying property. During 2007 and 2006, the maximum amount outstanding under
these programs was $52 million and $69 million, respectively. Loans receivable under these programs, as well as other unsecured advances outstanding, were $24 million and
$52 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006. The total outstanding loans receivable includes loans to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Company's former Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer (until June 2002). The amount outstanding under these loans, plus accrued interest, was $26 million and $52 million at both September 28, 2007 and
September 29, 2006, respectively, and the rate of interest charged on such loans was 5.4% and 5.0% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income on these interest bearing loans totaled
$1 million, $2 million, and $2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Certain of the above loans totaling $4 million and $30 million at September 28,
2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, are non-interest bearing.

During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors and new senior management adopted a policy under which no new loans are allowed to be granted to any officers of the Company and
existing loans are not allowed to be extended or modified.

2001, Tyco authorized compensation arrangements to L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Director until August 2002. In connection
with such arrangements, Tyco purchased executive split dollar life insurance policies for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz and entered into a shared ownership agreement with each of them whereby
the Company agreed to pay premiums for these insurance policies for an 11-year period beginning in 2001. In 2001, amended policies were executed providing for additional
Company-paid premiums. The Company is a co-beneficiary of the policies, less amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz. Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz are the
beneficiaries of the cash surrender
values of the policies plus the amount of any unpaid premiums. The Company's obligations under these arrangements were entered into in recognition of services rendered by these officers and were not
contingent upon continuing employment. At that time, the Company deposited $31 million into a rabbi trust to fund premiums on the policies. In the event the investment options within the
policies do not earn specified interest amounts, Tyco had guaranteed a supplemental premium payment amount to ensure a 10% annual return on the cash surrender value, and any unpaid premiums. This
liability was accreted by a charge to earnings throughout the period of the arrangements to make the specified supplemental premium payments, if any. In conjunction with Mr. Swartz's
termination of employment, a lump sum payment of $25 million, which represented the present value of the annual premium amounts at his termination date for the remainder of the contractual
period, was made to Mr. Swartz and in return Mr. Swartz waived Tyco's obligation to continue making premium payments. Tyco discontinued making premium payments for Mr. Kozlowski's
insurance policy as of October 1, 2002. The Company filed affirmative actions against Mr. Kozlowski, seeking disgorgement of all benefits under this executive life insurance policy.
Pending resolution of such action against Mr. Kozlowski, premium obligations since October 2002 have been drawn down from the cash surrender value of such policy to avoid termination of
such policy's death benefit. On September 27, 2006, the Company and Mr. Kozlowski entered into a general release agreement that terminated Mr. Kozlowski's shared ownership
agreement of the split dollar life insurance policy and the rabbi trust. As such, the Company has no continuing obligation to make any payment or contributions with respect to the split dollar
insurance policy or the rabbi trust. The Company recorded a credit of $72 million related to this liability in 2006 within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The Consolidated Financial Statements include charges of $7 million related to Mr. Kozlowski's life insurance policy in each of 2006 and 2005. The
$25 million that remained in the rabbi trust as of September 29, 2006 was received by Tyco during the first quarter of 2007.

The
Company filed civil complaints against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to alleged abuses of our Key Employee Loan
Program and relocation program, unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self-dealing transactions and other improper conduct.

In
June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related
wrongful conduct involving


a
$20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The payment was purportedly made
for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging our acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh pleaded guilty to a felony violation of New York law in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York County) and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the SEC in United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. Both the felony charge and the civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such payment. The felony charge accused Mr. Walsh of intentionally concealing
information concerning the payment from Tyco's directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities in the State of New York. The SEC action alleged that Mr. Walsh knew that
the registration statement covering the sale of Tyco securities as part of the CIT Group acquisition contained a material misrepresentation concerning fees payable in connection with the acquisition.
Pursuant to the plea and settlement, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on December 17, 2002. Our claims against Mr. Walsh are still pending.

Debt Tenders

On April 27, 2007, Tyco announced that, in connection with the Separation, Tyco and certain of its subsidiaries that are issuers of its corporate debt had
commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of its outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt, aggregating approximately $6.6 billion. Of this amount, approximately
$5.9 billion was non-convertible U.S. debt and $750 million was convertible U.S. debt, with maturities from 2007 to 2029. In conjunction with the tender offers, the relevant
issuer solicited consents for certain clarifying amendments to the indentures pursuant to which the debt was issued. Tyco received acceptance notices for approximately $2.1 billion, or 36% of
its outstanding non-convertible U.S. debt and approximately $726 million or 97% of its outstanding convertible U.S. debt. Debt which was not tendered in an amount of approximately
$3.8 billion remains with Tyco.

Additionally,
Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), commenced on April 30, 2007 tender offers
to purchase for cash all of its outstanding Euro and Pound Sterling denominated public debt, aggregating the equivalent of approximately $1.9 billion, with maturities from 2008 to 2031, issued
under its Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the "EMTN Notes") and a consent solicitation for certain clarifying amendments to the fiscal agency agreement pursuant to which the EMTN Notes were issued.
Tyco received acceptance notices for approximately $1.5 billion, or 80% of its EMTN Notes. The remaining EMTN Notes were repurchased pursuant to an optional redemption.

In
connection with the debt tender offers, Tyco incurred a pre-tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $647 million, for which no tax benefit
is available (see Note 5).

TIGSA's
remaining debt was contributed to Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to TIGSA.

Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities

On April 25, 2007, Tyco, certain of its subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three 364-day unsecured bridge loan facilities with
an aggregate commitment amount of $10 billion. At the end of May 2007, the aggregate commitment amount under these facilities was increased to $12.5 billion. Tyco borrowed
approximately $8.9 billion under the unsecured bridge loan facilities to fund its debt tender offers, repay its existing bank credit facilities and to finance the class action settlement. Of
this amount, approximately $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion was assigned to Covidien and Tyco Electronics, respectively. Tyco initially guaranteed the new unsecured bridge loan facilities
and Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed Tyco's obligations with respect to their unsecured bridge loan facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. This
facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on changes in its credit rating. As of September 28, 2007, Tyco's aggregate
commitment under its unsecured bridge loan facility was $4.0 billion and $367 million remained outstanding with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.5%.

On
October 1, 2007, the commitments with respect to the unused portion of the Company's unsecured bridge loan facility expired. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facility
and its letter of credit facility described below provide the lenders under those facilities with the right to demand repayment of outstanding amounts, and to terminate commitments to extend
additional credit, if


(i) certain
of the Company's outstanding public debt is declared due and payable and (ii) the Company does not have sufficient liquidity available under its unsecured bridge loan
facility to refinance such debt. As a result, on November 27, 2007, the Company secured additional firm commitments from certain of its lenders under the bridge loan facility. These additional
commitments provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to repay the outstanding public debt with borrowings of up to $4.0 billion. The additional commitments expire on, and any borrowings
under the facility would mature on, November 25, 2008. The facility may only be used to repay, settle or otherwise extinguish the public debt described above, which is the subject of ongoing
litigation between the Company and The Bank of New York. For more information regarding such litigation, see "Indenture Trustee Litigation" in Note 16.

Additionally,
on April 25, 2007, Tyco, certain of its subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three unsecured revolving credit facilities with an initial aggregate
commitment amount of $2.5 billion that increased to $4.25 billion at the time of the Separation. Of the aggregate commitment amount of $4.25 billion, a $1.25 billion
commitment is available to Tyco, and a $1.5 billion commitment was available to each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics. Tyco will use its revolving credit facilities for working capital, capital
expenditures and other corporate purposes. Tyco initially guaranteed the new revolving credit facilities and Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed Tyco's obligations with respect to their
revolving credit facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. At September 28, 2007, Tyco has borrowed $308 million under its unsecured revolving credit
facility. This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on changes in its credit rating.

The
unsecured revolving credit facilities replaced TIGSA's existing $1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility, $1.5 billion 3-year revolving
bank credit facility and $500 million 3-year unsecured letter of credit facility, which were all terminated by June 1, 2007 prior to their scheduled expiration dates of
December 16, 2009, December 21, 2007 and June 15, 2007, respectively. On the date of termination, no amounts were borrowed under the $1.0 billion facility and the
$1.5 billion facility, and letters of credit of $494 million were issued under the $500 million facility.

On
June 21, 2007, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a new $500 million letter of credit facility, with Citibank N.A. as administrative agent, expiring on December 15,
2007. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIFSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for
obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to the covenants under the bridge loan and revolving credit
facilities. TIFSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the bank's base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. As of September 28, 2007,
letters of credit of $494 million have been issued under the $500 million credit facility and $6 million remains available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this
credit facility at September 28, 2007. On October 19, 2007, the facility was amended. The amendment extended the maturity date to June 15, 2008 and adjusted the interest rate
spreads and fees applicable to extensions of credit thereunder. Loans under the amended letter of credit agreement will continue to bear interest based on LIBOR plus the applicable margin.

TIFSA's
bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of the Company's debt to its earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization and that limit its ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on its property. The Company's indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative
pledges, subsidiary debt


and
sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company's business. The Company believes it is in compliance with all of its debt covenants. The Bank of New
York, as indenture trustee under indentures dated as of June 9, 1998 and November 12, 2003, is contesting whether the Separation transactions were permitted under such indentures. See
Note 16.

Convertible Debentures

As of September 28, 2007, TIFSA had $21 million outstanding of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option ("the 3.125%
convertible senior debentures"). These debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco. These debentures were originally convertible into Tyco shares. As a result of the Separation and the
distribution of Covidien and Tyco Electronics shares to Tyco's shareholders, these debentures are now convertible into Tyco, Covidien and
Tyco Electronics shares. At any time subsequent to the Separation, holders may convert each $1,000 principal amount of the debentures into 11.496 Tyco common shares, 11.496 Covidien common shares and
11.496 Tyco Electronics common shares prior to the stated maturity. Additionally, holders of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures may require TIFSA to purchase all or a portion of their debentures
on January 15, 2015. If the option is exercised, TIFSA must repurchase the debentures at par plus accrued interest, and may elect to repurchase the securities for cash, common shares, or some
combination thereof. TIFSA may redeem for cash some or all of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures at any time on or after January 20, 2008, for an amount equal to the redemption price.

Other Debt Information

The fair value of debt was approximately $4.5 billion (book value of $4.5 billion) and $10.4 billion (book value of $9.6 billion) at
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, based on discounted cash flow analyses using current market interest rates.

The
aggregate amounts of principal debt, including capital leases, maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): $380 in 2008, $524 in 2009, $7 in
2010, $521 in 2011, $1,160 in 2012 and $1,885 thereafter.

The
weighted-average interest rate on total debt was 6.3% and 6.0% at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps.
The weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt was 5.5% at September 28, 2007. The impact of the Company's interest rate swap agreements on reported interest expense was a net increase
of $10 million for 2006 and a net decrease of $40 million for 2005, respectively. Of these amounts, $6 million of the increase in 2006 and $24 million of the decrease in
2005 for interest expense was allocated and included in discontinued operations.

14.    Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2008 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax
Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications in accordance with FIN No. 45,
"

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.

" Fair values were
determined with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications is $543 million, which is included in
other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 16 for further
discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement.

In
addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the
Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the
Separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining support. The estimated fair values of those obligations are $7 million, which are included in other liabilities with an offset
to shareholders' equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were recorded in accordance with FIN No. 45.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 16 for a discussion of these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Note 1.

In
2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the
replacement of certain


O-ring
seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tyco's acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of charge
to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the program.
The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Company's obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge which was
reflected in cost of sales. On May 1, 2007, the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Company announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. The
Company will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company further assessed the expected cost
to complete the program in light of the most current claims data and determined that an additional accrual of $10 million was necessary to satisfy the estimated remaining obligation. The
ultimate cost to complete the program will be impacted by a number of factors such as changes in material and labor costs, and the actual number of sprinkler heads replaced. Actual results could
differ from this estimate. Settlements during 2007 include cash expenditures of $38 million related to the VRP.

15.    Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt and derivative
financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments and accounts payable approximated book value at September 28, 2007 and September 29,
2006. See Note 13 for the fair value estimates of debt.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and changes in a derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge criteria are met. Fair value estimates are based on relevant market information, including current market rates and prices, assuming adequate market liquidity. Fair value estimates for
interest rate and cross-currency swaps were calculated by the Company or with the assistance of high-quality, third-party financial institutions known to be high volume participants in
this market.

The
Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company's objective for utilizing derivatives is to manage these
risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. For those transactions that are designated as hedges, the Company documents relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, and links derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions. For transactions designated as hedges, the Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates, the Company has historically entered into various interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting
as principal counterparties. To ensure both appropriate use as a hedge and hedge accounting treatment, all derivatives entered into were designated according to a hedge objective against specified
forecasted interest payments on specifically underwritten debt issuances. The Company's primary hedge objectives include the conversion of fixed-rate liabilities to variable rates. The
derivative financial instruments associated with these objectives are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges.


As
part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes forward and option contracts with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties. The objective of these derivative contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows associated with intercompany loans,
notes receivable and accounts payable, and forecasted transactions due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The
Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as Tyco deals with a variety of
major banks worldwide with long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments are utilized,
thereby affording optimum clarity as to the market risk. None of the Company's derivative financial instruments outstanding at year end would result in a significant loss to the Company if a
counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, the Company does not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to its derivative
financial instruments.

In
assessing the current and potential future risk attributable to interest rate movements, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company terminated interest rate swaps and cross
currency agreements with an aggregate notional value of $2.5 billion. The fair value of the swaps at the time of termination was a net gain of $10 million. As the interest rate swaps
were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the net deferred loss of $26 million will be recognized in earnings over the remaining term of the related debt instrument. The
remaining agreements were terminated during the first quarter of 2007.

Interest Rate Exposures

The Company historically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company
terminated the interest rate swaps. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related loss will be amortized over the remaining life of the related
debt instruments. Prior to termination, the mark-to-market effects of both the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying debt obligations were recorded in interest
expense and are directly offsetting to the extent the hedges are effective.

In
addition, the Company historically utilized interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements ("cross currency swaps") to manage its exposure to interest rate risk and foreign
currency exposure on loans denominated in foreign currency. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company terminated these agreements. The settlement of the swaps terminated during the first quarter
of 2007 along with $17 million of swaps in a gain position that were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million in the first quarter of 2007.
In connection with the debt tender offer, $9 million of unamortized loss on interest rate swaps was accelerated and recorded as a loss on retirement of debt and included in other expense, net
(see Note 13). At September 28, 2007 there were no cross-currency or interest rate swaps outstanding. Prior to termination, the mark-to-market effects on the
interest rate and foreign currency swaps were recorded in interest expense and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, and directly offset the corresponding changes in the fair
value of the hedged items to the extent the hedges were effective. The ineffective portion of the hedge was not material.


Foreign Currency Exposures

The Company uses forward agreements to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on raw material purchases. These forward agreements are designated as
cash flow hedges. Gains and losses resulting from these hedges, the amounts of which are not material in any period presented, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from
other comprehensive income to earnings and recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales when the underlying transaction impacts earnings.

Tyco
uses various options, swaps, and forwards not designated as hedging instruments, to manage foreign currency exposures on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable,
intercompany loans and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. For derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company records changes in fair value in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the income statement in the period of change. The fair value of these instruments totaled $95 million at September 28, 2007.

In
December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company determined that it would no longer consider certain intercompany
foreign currency transactions to be long-term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the income statement
subsequent to this determination rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders' equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments,
continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges. The remaining forward and option contracts are marked to market with changes in the derivatives'
fair value recognized in the income statement.

Previously,
the Company hedged its net investment in certain foreign operations. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts qualifying as net investment hedges are reported in the
cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedges are effective. The cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive
income includes a net loss of $299 million and $91 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively, for hedges of the foreign currency exposure of the Company's net investment in certain
foreign operations. In connection with the Separation and the debt tender, the Company de-designated its 6.125% Euro denominated public notes due 2007 on March 29, 2007, its 5.5%
Euro denominated public notes due 2008 and its 6.5% British Pound denominated public notes due 2031 on May 21, 2007, that had previously been considered as hedges of net investments in certain
foreign operations. At September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its net investments in foreign operations, and all of its outstanding borrowings were denominated in U.S. dollars.

Convertible Debentures

Given the potential requirement to convert the Company's 3.125% convertible senior debentures into shares of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, the Separation and
Distribution Agreement provides for Covidien and Tyco Electronics to deliver such shares as needed. Tyco recorded an asset for the fair value of the Covidien and Tyco Electronics shares required to
satisfy the obligation to the debenture holders. Tyco also recorded the related conversion option as a liability at fair value. These amounts were established with an offset to shareholders' equity in
connection with the Separation. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Tyco recorded a $3 million credit to other expense, net for the changes in fair


value
of the asset and the conversion option. At September 28, 2007, the fair value of the asset and the conversion option liability were $19 million and $15 million,
respectively.

16.    Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has facility, vehicle and equipment leases that expire at various dates through the year 2027. Rental expense under these leases was
$410 million, $390 million, and $405 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company also has facility and equipment commitments under capital leases.

The
Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services. At September 28, 2007, such obligations were as follows:
$114 million in 2008, $7 million in 2009, $3 million in 2010 and $0 million thereafter.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain class actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Subject
to the terms and
conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations.

Tyco
has assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre-Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include
securities class action litigation, ERISA class action litigation, certain legacy tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin-offs or the distributions made or brought by
any third party except for litigation related to our public debt. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin-offs that are subject
to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. As described in the Separation
and Distribution Agreement, Tyco, Tyco Electronics and Covidien are jointly and severally liable for all amounts relating to the previously


disclosed
securities class action settlement. All costs and expenses that Tyco incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which will
be allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Covidien, Tyco Electronics and Tyco.

Class Actions and Class Action Settlement

As a result of actions taken by certain of the Company's former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of the Company's former senior corporate
management, including former members of its Board of Directors and former General Counsel are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions
of the federal securities laws. In addition, Tyco, certain of its current and former employees, some members of the Company's former senior corporate management and some former members of the
Company's Board of Directors also are named as defendants in several Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") class actions. The Company is generally obligated to indemnify its directors and
officers and its former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, the Company's insurance carriers may
decline coverage, or the Company's coverage may be insufficient to cover its expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters.

On
May 14, 2007, Tyco entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities class action lawsuits. The
Memorandum of Understanding does not resolve all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the proposed settlement does not release claims arising under ERISA and the lawsuits
arising thereunder

.

Under
the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration for
the payment of $2.975 billion from Tyco to the certified class. The parties to the Memorandum of Understanding have applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On
July 13, 2007, the U. S. District Court in Concord, New Hampshire granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement
was held. The Court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued in a few weeks. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the
Memorandum of Understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.

The
deadline for deciding not to participate in the class settlement was September 28, 2007. As of such date, Tyco had received opt-out notices from individuals and entities
totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. These individuals and entities may pursue their claims separately against Tyco and any judgments resulting from such claims would not
reduce the settlement amount. One entity, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, has filed a complaint against Tyco on September 24, 2007 in an action styled

Franklin Mutual Advisers,
LLC v. Tyco International Ltd.

in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933,
15 U.S.C. Sec. 77(b), Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and
Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(k) in connection with the plaintiffs' purchases and sales of Tyco securities between June 4, 2001
and April 30, 2002. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Tyco has requested that this action be transferred to the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Tyco intends to vigorously defend the litigation. It is not possible at this time to predict the


final
outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the

Franklin

matter
or other unasserted claims from individuals that have opted-out.

Under
the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation, each of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable
for the full amount of the class action settlement and any judgments resulting from opt-out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability
and related escrow accounts, with Tyco assuming 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount.

Tyco
incurred a charge to expense, for which no tax benefit is available, and a current liability of $2.975 billion in 2007. The Company has also recovered or expects to recover
certain of these costs from insurers. As such, the Company recorded $113 million of recoveries in connection with the class action settlement in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Tyco
borrowed under its unsecured bridge and credit facilities to fund the liability and placed the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. In connection with the Separation, Covidien and Tyco
Electronics assumed their portion of the related borrowing. The escrow accounts will earn interest that is payable to the class. Interest is also accrued on the class action settlement liability.
Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at
September 28, 2007 Tyco had a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability of $1,257 million and $927 million, respectively, and a payable to
Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their interest in the escrow accounts. Receivables and payables that pertain to the class action settlement and related escrow accounts with the same counterparty are
presented net in the consolidated balance sheet. Tyco's portion of the liability is $808 million. Additionally, Tyco has paid $73 million and recorded payables of $9 million at
September 28, 2007, with an offset to shareholders' equity for amounts due to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the insurance recovery.

If
the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco, it is possible that the Company will be
required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Investigations

The Company and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the United States Department of Labor, state
departments of labor, the General Service Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into the Company's governance, management,
operations, accounting and related controls. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans. The Company cannot predict when these investigations
will be completed, nor can the Company predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that the Company will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future
conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government entities or instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact the Company's business with non-governmental customers)
or suffer other penalties or adverse impacts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible
loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.


Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site
cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of
September 28, 2007, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $36 million to $63 million. As of September 28,
2007, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $40 million, of which $11 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and
$29 million is included in other liabilities on Tyco's Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company believes that
any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Tyco
has recorded asset retirement obligations ("AROs") according to the provisions of SFAS No. 143, "

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations

," and FIN No. 147 for the estimated future costs associated with legal obligations to retire certain assets. As of September 28, 2007 and
September 29, 2006, the Company's AROs were $13 million in both periods. The Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect
on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See further discussions on the implementation of FIN No. 47 in Note 7.

Asbestos Matters

Tyco and some of its subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries of Covidien are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to
asbestos-containing materials. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien has assumed all liabilities for pending cases filed against Covidien's subsidiaries. Consistent with the
national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. A limited number of the cases allege premises
liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of
past distribution of heat-resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-
containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants.

Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these
claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuits that have been filed against it and its subsidiaries. To date, the
Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle
and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 28, 2007, there were approximately 5,600 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.

The
Company estimates its pending asbestos claims and claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Company's estimate of
the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers


claims
expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with
certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial
indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes

In connection with the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs
Covidien's, Tyco Electronics' and Tyco's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if
any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes
within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the
Code.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, with certain exceptions, Tyco generally is responsible for the payment of 27% of any additional U.S. income taxes that are required to be paid to a U.S.
tax authority as a result of a U.S. tax audit of Covidien's, Tyco Electronics' or Tyco's subsidiaries' income tax returns for all periods prior to the spin-offs.

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company shares responsibility for certain of Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods
prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments
made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally
among the parties. At September 28, 2007, Tyco has recorded a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $103 million reflected in other assets as our estimate of their portion of
the Tax Sharing obligations with an offset to shareholders' equity. Other liabilities include $543 million for the fair value of Tyco's obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, determined
in accordance with FIN 45 recognized with an offset to shareholders' equity.

Tyco
will provide payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the IRS audit process is completed for the
impacted years. Given the nature of the shared liabilities, the maximum amount of potential future payments is not determinable.

In
the event the Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party
responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the
Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, then Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco
Electronics as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's
sharing formula. In addition,


Covidien
and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement
that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law
for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share
of Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' tax liabilities.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and
contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable
have been recorded.

In
2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the 1997 through 2000 years, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax
returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during 2006, the Company developed proposed
amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of these adjustments is
probable and accordingly has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

The
Company has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002, which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of
the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002. When the Company's tax return positions are updated additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While
the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

During
the third quarter of 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated
Revenue Agents' Reports ("RARs") which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of the Company's
previously filed tax return positions, all of which the Company expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, the Company has made no additional provision during the year
ended September 28, 2007 as a result of the proposed audit adjustments in the RARs.

The
Company has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to the Company of $458 million, and during the third quarter of
2007, the Company paid $458 million, of which $163 million relates to the Company's discontinued operations. The Company


appealed
other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion, and, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend
its prior filed tax return positions. The Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its financial statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the ultimate
resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these
matters could result in the Company filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on the Company's
effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

Additionally,
the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection
with certain intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and
$50 million. The Company as Audit Managing Party will vigorously oppose the assertion of such penalties against Tyco Electronics, in part, because beginning in 2003 the Company discovered,
investigated and reported the conduct at issue to the IRS and fully cooperated in the criminal prosecution of the Company's former Chief Tax Officer on a charge of willful filing of a false tax
return.

Compliance Matters

Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. As
previously reported, we have been informed that two subsidiaries in our Flow Control business in Italy have been named in a request for criminal charges filed by the Milan public prosecutor's office.
Tyco has reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and
the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act ("FCPA"), that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and
will continue to communicate with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of
potential improper payments identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. Covidien and Tyco Electronics agreed, in connection with the Separation, to cooperate with the
Company in its response to these allegations. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements. At this time, Tyco cannot predict
the outcome of these matters and other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may
result from an adverse resolution of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Any
judgment required to be paid or settlement or other cost incurred by Tyco in connection with these matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics


businesses
of Tyco to Covidien or Tyco Electronics, respectively, and provides that Tyco will retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations. Any liabilities not primarily related
to a particular segment will be shared equally among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics.

The
German Federal Cartel Office ("FCO") charged that certain German subsidiaries in Tyco's Flow Control business have engaged in anti-competitive practices, in particular
with regard to its hydrant, valve, street box and fittings business. Tyco investigated this matter and determined that the conduct may have violated German anti-trust-law. Tyco
is cooperating with the FCO in its investigation of this violation. Tyco cannot estimate the range of potential loss that may result from this violation. It is possible that the Company may be subject
to civil or criminal proceedings and may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Indenture Trustee Litigation

On June 4, 2007, The Bank of New York ("BONY"), as indenture trustee under the indentures dated as of June 9, 1998 and November 12, 2003, of
Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco, commenced an action against TIGSA and Tyco in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. BONY
served an amended complaint on October 18, 2007, which added Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA") as an additional defendant. As amended, the complaint alleges that the Separation breached
the indentures and seeks damages on behalf of noteholders in excess of $4.1 billion, consisting of principal plus accrued interest on the notes issued under the indentures, plus a
"make-whole" amount payable under the indentures in the event of early redemption of the notes. The amended complaint also seeks a judgment declaring that BONY was not required to sign
supplemental indentures proposed by TIGSA, TIFSA and Tyco in connection with the Separation. BONY also seeks a declaratory judgment that TIGSA is obligated to pay BONY reasonable compensation and to
reimburse BONY for all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the Separation and in resolving the proper interpretation of the indentures. On November 15,
2007, Tyco and TIFSA filed counterclaims against BONY, alleging that its refusal to sign the supplemental indentures in connection with the Separation and the filing of the amended complaint
constituted a breach of the indentures and a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in the indentures. They seek unspecified damages on these claims. Tyco and TIFSA also seek a
declaratory judgment that no default has occurred and that BONY is required to sign the supplemental indentures.

On
November 8, 2007, BONY delivered to the Company a Notice of Events of Default, claiming that the actions taken by the Company in connection with the Separation constitute
events of default under the indentures. The claims made in the Notice of Events of Default are the same as those alleged by BONY in the litigation, and the Company continues to believe that no default
or event of default has occurred. The indentures provide for a 90-day cure period following delivery of the notice of default, after which BONY could declare any outstanding amounts under
the indentures immediately due and payable. We would contest such an acceleration.

TIGSA,
TIFSA and Tyco continue to believe that the Separation and the proposed supplemental indentures are permitted under the indentures and that no "make-whole" amount is
payable. The Company intends to vigorously defend the claims of default and believes it will prevail in legal proceedings.


If
we did not have liquidity available to repay the outstanding debt under the 1998 and 2003 indentures under our 364-day bridge facility, such an acceleration of the
outstanding notes would have permitted a majority of the lenders under each of our bank and letter of credit facilities to demand repayment of amounts outstanding under those facilities, and to
terminate their commitments to extend additional credit thereunder. As a result, on November 27, 2007, the Company secured additional firm commitments from certain of its lenders under the
bridge facility, providing the Company with additional borrowings of up to $4.0 billion to repay such notes. The additional commitments expire on, and any borrowings under the facility would
mature on, November 25, 2008. The facility may only be used to repay, settle or otherwise extinguish the amounts required to be paid in connection with the litigation with BONY.

ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund
(the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan such as the Fund, the employer is liable for
withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between Grinnell Fire Protection Systems,
SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669.

ERISA
requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan. A plan's assessment of
withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration, and ERISA requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration. If the employer
prevails in arbitration (and any subsequent court appeals), its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest. The Fund's total withdrawal liability assessment against
SimplexGrinnell is approximately $25 million, and the quarterly withdrawal liability payments are $1.1 million commencing on August 1, 2007. SimplexGrinnell believes that it has
strong arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the Fund, and it plans to vigorously defend against the Fund's withdrawal liability assessment by timely filing for arbitration. Accordingly,
the Company has made no provision for this contingency in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Matters

Earth Tech v. City of Phoenix

is a contract dispute arising from Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix,
Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. On December 21, 2005, Earth Tech filed a lawsuit against the City of Phoenix in the Maricopa County
Superior Court alleging $3 million in damages plus interest for the City's failure to pay dewatering and computer systems costs related to the 91

st

Avenue project. After the City
rejected Earth Tech's administrative claim against the City, Earth Tech filed and served a First Amended Complaint upon the City of Phoenix. In its First Amended Complaint, Earth Tech alleged eighteen
causes of action and requested the following: (i) a recovery of at least $73 million for the value of the services performed by Earth Tech in connection with the contract; (ii) a
rescission of the contract; (iii) an equitable adjustment of the Contract price for additional dewatering services and the Computer Control System; and (iv) costs for demobilization and
termination of the contract. The City of Phoenix filed a Motion to


Dismiss
rather than filing an answer to the First Amended Complaint on May 18, 2006. The Court granted the City's Motion to Dismiss without prejudice on September 19, 2006 allowing Earth
Tech 30 days to file a Second Amended Complaint. Earth Tech filed its Second Amended Compliant against the City of Phoenix on September 25, 2006. In connection with this matter,
the Company has assets, which it has assessed as recoverable, of $50 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006.

On
December 29, 2005, the City of Phoenix filed a lawsuit against Earth Tech, Inc., its surety, Federal Insurance Company and other unnamed parties in the Maricopa County
Superior Court,

The City of Phoenix v. Earth Tech, Inc., Federal Insurance Company and John Does 1-50.

The lawsuit is in connection
with the City of Phoenix's termination on August 12, 2005 of Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment
Plant. The City alleges the following causes of action: (i) Earth Tech breached its Pre-Construction Services and Construction Management at Risk Contracts; (ii) Earth Tech
did not properly, reasonably or timely manage, supervise or inspect the work under the Contracts; (iii) Federal Insurance breached the terms and conditions of the performance bond; and
(iv) Federal Insurance failed to investigate the City's Bond Claims. The City requested unspecified general, consequential, incidental, special and liquidated damages plus interest as its
relief. On February 8, 2006, Earth Tech filed a Motion to Dismiss the City's Complaint in which Federal Insurance Company joined. The Court denied Earth Tech's Motion to Dismiss on
September 25, 2006. The City of Phoenix filed an Amended Complaint against Earth Tech and Federal Insurance on September 25, 2006. In the Amended Complaint, the City of Phoenix alleged
damages of $128 million.

The
Presiding Judge of Maricopa County Superior Court on July 11, 2006 consolidated all of the pending lawsuits related to this dispute on the Court's complex litigation docket.
On June 6, 2007, the Court granted Earth Tech's motion for partial summary judgment, ordering that application of Arizona's Prompt Payment Act was appropriate and that any material
inconsistencies in the contract be resolved in favor of the Act's requirements. On October 19, 2007, Earth Tech filed a second motion related to the Prompt Payment Act, arguing that the City of
Phoenix breached its contract with Earth Tech by failing to make payment on a Payment Application that was deemed certified and approved
under the Prompt Payment Act. The Court is likely to rule on the motion sometime in the spring of 2008. Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of
potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of this matter.

Fitzpatrick Contractors Limited v. Tyco Fire and Integrated Solutions (UK) Ltd.

On July 18, 2007, Fitzpatrick Contractors
Limited ("FCL") commenced an action against Tyco Fire and Integrated Solutions (UK) Ltd. in the High Court of Justice, Queen Bench Division, Technology and Construction Court,
United Kingdom, alleging that Tyco entered into a binding contract in 2002 for the design, manufacture and installation of mechanical and electrical works for the refurbishment of a portion of London
Transport's Blackwell Tunnel. FCL seeks a declaratory judgment that a contract was formed between the parties and seeks damages for breach of contract in the amount of approximately
$38 million. Tyco believes it has valid counterclaims for unpaid amounts owed to it by FCL for design work, purchased equipment and subcontracted construction work associated with the project,
but denies that it entered a binding contract with FCL for the project and intends to defend this action vigorously. While it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of this dispute,
Tyco does not believe this action will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


Sensormatic Security Corp. v. Sensormatic Electronics Corp., ADT Security Services, Inc. and Wallace Computer Services, Inc.

In
April 2002, litigation was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland by a Sensormatic franchisee, Sensormatic Security Corp. ("SSC"), alleging breach of contract
against Sensormatic and tortuous interference with contract against ADT and Wallace Computer Services, Inc., a party unrelated to Tyco. The litigation was based on allegedly unpaid commissions under a
franchise agreement. The lawsuit also alleges that Sensormatic improperly authorized third parties (including ADT and Wallace) to sell in SSC's exclusive territory of Maryland, Virginia and the
District of Columbia. Sensormatic has agreed to indemnify Wallace. SSC seeks an accounting, monetary damages (including punitive damages against ADT and Wallace), and injunctive relief. Sensormatic
and ADT have denied SSC's allegations and asserted affirmative defenses. Sensormatic also filed a counterclaim seeking recovery of overpayments made to SSC. On September 7, 2006, the trial
court denied in part and granted in part the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. Among other things, the Court ruled that SSC has the right to commissions on all Sensormatic CCTV products
(not just SensorVision systems) if sold for automatic theft detection in the franchise territory and SSC has the right to commissions on CCTV indirect sales if sold for automatic theft detection in
the franchise territory. Sensormatic and ADT intend to appeal those rulings. Sensormatic and ADT will continue to vigorously defend the litigation. While it is not possible at this time to predict the
final outcome of this dispute, Tyco does not believe this action will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the
outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

17.    Retirement Plans

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. SFAS No. 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and
other postretirement benefit plans on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs that have not yet
been included in net periodic benefit cost as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 on
September 28, 2007. The Company uses a measurement date of August 31

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans
covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S.
employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations which use the projected unit
credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution
amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of
service and compensation. The following tables exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

In
connection with the Separation, the Company legally separated certain pension plans that included participants of Tyco Healthcare, Tyco Electronics and other subsidiaries. As a
result, the Company remeasured the assets and projected benefit obligation of the separated pension plans. The impact of the remeasurement on continuing operations was immaterial. Also, during 2007,
the Company completed the merger of certain pension plans in the United Kingdom, which resulted in an increase to the minimum pension liability with a corresponding decrease to accumulated other
comprehensive income of $10 million, net of income taxes.

The
net periodic benefit cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans for 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows ($ in millions):

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. plans as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was $776 million and $795 million, respectively. The
accumulated benefit obligation for all non-U.S. plans as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was $1,468 million and $1,413 million, respectively.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $111 million and
$67 million, respectively, at September 28, 2007 and $794 million and $719 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$1,278 million and $988 million, respectively, at September 28, 2007 and $1,402 million and $980 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006.

The
aggregate benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $111 million and $67 million,
respectively, at September 28, 2007, and $802 million and $719 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006.


The
aggregate benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1,519 million and
$1,175 million, respectively, at September 28, 2007, and $1,492 million and $989 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006.

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations as provided by
its external advisors.

The
Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a superior return on assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40%
allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S. pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 52% to equity securities, 43% to
debt securities and 5% to other asset classes, including real estate and cash equivalents.

Pension
plans have the following weighted-average asset allocations:

Although
the Company does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly
hold Tyco stock. The aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that it will contribute at least the minimum required to its pension plans in 2008 of $5 million for the U.S.
plans and $64 million for non-U.S. plans.

Benefit
payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows ($

2013-2017




The
Company also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit plans on behalf of certain employees. Pension expense related to multi-employer plans was $3 million,
$3 million and $12 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Executive Retirement Arrangements

—Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz participated in individual Executive Retirement
Arrangements maintained by Tyco (the "ERA"). Under the ERA, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz would have fixed lifetime benefits commencing at their normal retirement age of 65. The Company's
accrued benefit obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 28, 2007 were $71 million and $36 million, respectively. The Company's accrued benefit
obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 29, 2006 were $66 million and $34 million, respectively. Retirement benefits are available at earlier ages and
alternative forms of benefits can be elected. Any such variations would be actuarially equivalent to the fixed lifetime benefit starting at age 65. Amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz
under the ERA are in dispute by the Company.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

—The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include
401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants'
compensation and was $78 million, $73 million and $67 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company also maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
("SERP"). This plan is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to IRS limits on eligible compensation under the defined contribution plans. Expense related to the
SERP was $3 million in 2007, $2 million in 2006 and $3 million in 2005.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer
a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts.
The measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation expense was
$13 million, $6 million and $7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $100 million and $91 million at
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively.

Rabbi Trusts

—The Company has rabbi trusts, the assets of which may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The
trusts primarily hold corporate-owned life insurance policies, cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity securities. During 2007, the Company, as permitted under the trust agreement, sold
substantially all of the assets from one of the trusts and received $271 million of proceeds. At September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, trust assets totaled $2 million
and $265 million, respectively. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policies, net of outstanding loans, included in the rabbi trust was $224 million at September 29,
2006. The rabbi trust assets, which are consolidated, are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. Plan participants are general creditors of the
Company with respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

—The Company generally does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions for its
employees. However, certain acquired operations provide these benefits to employees who were eligible at the date of acquisition, and a small number of U.S. and Canadian operations provide on going
eligibility for such benefits.

For
measurement purposes, a 10.0% and 11.4% composite annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed at September 28, 2007 and
September 29, 2006, respectively. At September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, the composite annual rate of increase in health care benefit costs was assumed to decrease
gradually to 5.0% by the year 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects ($ in

Effect on postretirement benefit obligation


(4

)


In
December 2003, the US enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. Certain of the Company's retiree medical programs already provided prescription drug coverage for retirees over age 65 that were at least as generous as the benefits provided under
Medicare. This Act reduces the Company's obligation in these instances. The Company included the effects of the Act in the Consolidated Financial Statements by reducing net periodic benefit cost by
$5 million for 2005, and reflecting an actuarial gain which reduced its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $30 million at September 30, 2005.

18.    Shareholders' Equity

Preference Shares

—Tyco has authorized 31,250,000 preference shares, par value of $4 per share, none of which were issued and
outstanding at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006. Rights as to dividends, return of capital, redemption, conversion, voting and otherwise with respect to the preference shares
may be determined by Tyco's Board of Directors on or before the time of issuance. In the event of the liquidation of the Company, the holders of any preference shares then outstanding would be
entitled to payment to them of the amount for which the preference shares were subscribed and any unpaid dividends prior to any payment to the common shareholders.

Dividends

—On September 13, 2007 Tyco's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Company's common shares
of $0.15 per share payable on November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007. Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 in
the first quarter of 2005 and $0.40 thereafter.

Shares Owned by Subsidiaries

—Shares owned by subsidiaries are treated as treasury shares and are recorded at cost. In
connection with the Separation, all such shares were effectively retired during the third quarter of 2007 and repurchases commenced in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Share Repurchase Program

—In September 2007, Tyco's Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase
program. In July 2005 and May 2006, Tyco's Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs of $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter
of 2007, the Company repurchased 1.3 million common shares for $56 million under the $1.0 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company
repurchased 5 million common shares for $659 million completing the $2.0 billion share repurchase program. During 2006, the Company repurchased 11 million common shares for
$1.2 billion completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program and 13 million common shares for $1.3 billion under the $2.0 billion share repurchase program.
During 2005, the Company repurchased 3 million common shares for $300 million.

19.    Share Plans

In connection with the Separation, share options were modified through the issuance of Covidien and Tyco Electronics share options. As a result of the one for
four share split, share option exercise


prices
for the Tyco awards were adjusted. Generally, employee share options converted into share options of the employer with the exception of corporate employees whose awards converted into share
options of all three companies. The revisions made to the share options as a result of the Separation constituted a modification under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R which requires a
comparison of fair values of the share options immediately before the Separation and the fair values immediately after the Separation. In certain instances, the fair value immediately after the
separation was higher. As a result, the modification will result in incremental compensation cost of $18 million. Of this amount, $13 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2007
for vested share options ($11 million in discontinued operations) and $2 million will be recorded in continuing operations over the remaining vesting period of the share options. The
continuing operations impact was included in separation costs. Except for the changes described, the principal terms of the share options remain unchanged from the original grant.

Also
in connection with the Separation, Tyco employee restricted share awards and restricted stock units (collectively, "restricted share awards") were modified through the issuance of
Covidien and Tyco Electronics restricted shares or the conversion to shares of the employer. Restricted shares and restricted share units held by employees in the company in which they are not
employed are subject to accelerated vesting provisions and vest 50% on the first day of trading after the Separation and 50% six months thereafter. This accelerated vesting will result in
$14 million of accelerated compensation expense for Tyco's continuing operations. Tyco recorded $12 million as selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007
and will record the remaining expense in the first quarter of 2008. Equity awards under the Save-As-You-Earn Plan (the "SAYE Plan") were not modified in connection with the Separation thereby
resulting in additional compensation expense of $14 million, $5 million of which was recorded in 2007 ($2 million in discontinued operations), with the balance to be recorded over
the remaining vesting period. Except for the changes described, the principal terms and conditions of restricted shares, restricted units and deferred stock units of the employees remain unchanged
from the original grant.

The
Company amended the terms of performance based awards granted on November 22, 2005 to provide for vesting of the remaining awards without regard to the original performance
measures. The original performance awards, which were previously adjusted to reflect the attainment of performance metrics through fiscal year 2006, were converted to time based restricted stock units
of the employer, with the exception of corporate employees whose outstanding awards were converted to time based restricted stock units of the three separate companies.

Effective
October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the
compensation cost recognized beginning October 1, 2005 includes compensation cost for (i) all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of October 1, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all share-based payments granted subsequent to
September 30, 2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the
requisite service period or period to retirement eligibility, if shorter. Prior period amounts have not been restated for the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.


As
a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended September 28, 2007 and September 29,
2006 include incremental share-based compensation expense of $66 million and $82 million, respectively. Total share-based compensation cost recognized during 2007 was
$297 million, which includes $155 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, $13 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges, net, $6 million in
separation costs and $123 million in discontinued operations. Total share-based compensation cost recognized during 2006 was $288 million, which includes $155 million in selling,
general and administrative expenses and $133 million in discontinued operations. Total share-based compensation cost recognized during 2005 was $108 million, which includes
$59 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $49 million in discontinued operations. The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based
compensation arrangements during 2007, 2006 and 2005 of $78 million, $85 million and $36 million, respectively, of which $31 million, $41 million and
$14 million is included in discontinued operations, respectively.

Prior
to October 1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS
No. 123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at the date of grant.
Had the fair value based method as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 been applied by Tyco, the effect on net income and earnings per share for 2005, adjusted for the impact of the Separation and the
one for four reverse stock split, would have been as follows ($ in millions, except per share data):

During
2004, the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") effectively replaced the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan, as
amended as of May 12, 1999 (the "LTIP I Plan"), the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan"), as well as the Tyco International Ltd. 1994
Restricted Stock Ownership Plan for Key Employees (the "1994 Plan") for all awards effective on and after March 25, 2004. The 2004 Plan provides for the award of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long term performance awards, restricted units, restricted stock, deferred stock units, promissory stock and other stock-based awards (collectively,
"Awards").


The
2004 Plan provides for a maximum of 36 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan. In addition, any
common shares that have been approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the LTIP Plans but which have not been awarded thereunder as of January 1, 2004, reduced by the number of
common shares related to Awards made under the LTIP Plans between January 1, 2004 and March 25, 2004, the date the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, (or which have been awarded but
will not be issued, owing to expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004) and which are no longer
available for any reason (including the termination of the LTIP Plans) will also be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. When common
shares are issued pursuant to a grant of restricted share awards, deferred stock units, promissory stock, and performance units or as payment of an annual performance bonus or other stock-based award,
the total number of common shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per common share issued. At September 28, 2007, there were approximately
31 million shares available for future grant under the 2004 Plan (including shares available under both the LTIP I and LTIP II Plans that are now assumable under the 2004 Plan).

The
1994 Plan provided for the issuance of restricted stock grants to officers and non-officer employees. The 1994 Plan expired in November 2004; thus no additional
grants of restricted stock have been made under this plan since November 2004 and no shares are available for future grant. At September 28, 2007, 14 million shares had been
granted, of which 10 million were granted under the 2004 Plan and 4 million were granted under the 1994 Plan.

The
LTIP I Plan reserved common shares for issuance to Tyco's directors, executives and managers as share options. This plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which consists exclusively of independent directors of the Company. At September 28, 2007, there were approximately 0.5 million shares
originally reserved for issuance under this plan but now available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

The
LTIP II Plan was a broad-based option plan for non-officer employees. The terms and conditions of this plan are similar to the LTIP I Plan. At September 28, 2007,
there were approximately 0.1 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan that are now available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

Share Options

—Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of
the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over
a period of three or four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.

At
September 28, 2007, approximately 250 million share options had been granted of which 138 million, 76 million and 36 million were granted under the
LTIP I, LTIP II and 2004 Plans, respectively.

The
grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make


certain
assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock and implied volatility derived from exchange
traded options. Post Separation, expected volatility was calculated based on an analysis of historic and implied volatility measures for a set of peer companies. The average expected life was based on
the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are
estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for 2007, 2006
and 2005 are as follows:

The

exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $163 million, $108 million and $142 million, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for
2007 and 2006 was not significant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

—Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and
employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in an employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the
purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All shares purchased under the plan are purchased
on the open market by a designated broker.

Under
the SAYE Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom are granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant.
Options under the SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. The SAYE Plan provides for a maximum of 10 million common
shares to be issued; as of September 28, 2007, there were 7 million shares available for future issuance. All of the shares purchased under the SAYE Plan are purchased on the open
market.

The
grant-date-fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions for expected volatility, the average
expected life, and the risk-free rate were made using the same methodology as previously described under

Share Options

.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted under the SAYE Plan during 2006 and 2005 was $8.80, and $12.65, respectively. The total intrinsic value of
options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $5 million, $24 million and $3 million, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow
for 2007 and 2006 was not significant.

As
of September 28, 2007, there was $2 million in total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options granted under the SAYE Plan. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a period of 1.3 fiscal years.


Restricted Share Awards

—Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are
determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon normal retirement, death or disability of the employee.

For
grants which vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market value of the shares or units is expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of
criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair
value of restricted share awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest after a period of three or four years, as
determined by the Compensation Committee, upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels, if applicable. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share
awards is net of estimated forfeitures.

Recipients
of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents.

A
summary of the status of the Company's restricted share awards and performance shares as of September 28, 2007 and changes during the year then ended is presented in the tables
below and has been adjusted for the conversion of Tyco restricted share awards and performance shares to restricted share awards and performance shares of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, the Separation

As
of September 28, 2007, there was $144 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to both non-vested restricted share awards and performance
shares. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 fiscal years.

Deferred Stock Units

—Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco common shares with
distribution deferred until termination of employment. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the fair
value of DSUs is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote
such shares and do not have the right to receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to receive dividend equivalents. Conditions of vesting are determined at
the time of grant. Under the 2004 Plan, the majority of Tyco's DSU grants vest in equal annual installments over three years. The Company has granted 1 million DSUs, all of which were
outstanding at September 28, 2007.

A
summary of the status of the Company's DSUs as of September 28, 2007 and changes during the year then ended is presented below and has been adjusted for the Separation and the
