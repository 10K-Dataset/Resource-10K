Item 1.    Business

General

Tyco International Ltd. ("we," "Tyco" or the "Company") is a diversified manufacturing and service company that, through its subsidiaries:

•

designs,
manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components and related solutions;

•

designs,
manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems;

•

designs,
manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and

•

designs,
manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides consulting,
engineering and construction management and operating services.

Tyco
International Ltd., which is organized under the laws of Bermuda, was created as a result of the July 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a
Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited, a public company organized under the laws of Bermuda, at which time ADT Limited changed its name to Tyco International Ltd.

Unless
otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2006, 2005 and 2004 are to Tyco's fiscal year ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and
September 30, 2004, respectively.

Strategy

As previously reported in our periodic filings, on January 13, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the
Company into three separate, publicly traded companies—Tyco Healthcare, one of the world's leading diversified healthcare companies; Tyco Electronics, the world's largest passive
electronic components manufacturer; and a combination of Tyco Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services, a global business with leading positions in residential and commercial security,
fire protection and industrial products and services (the "Proposed Separation"). After thorough reviews of strategic options with our Board of Directors, we believe that this strategy is the best way
to position our market-leading companies for sustained growth and value creation.

Consummation
of the Proposed Separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of
counsel, the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the completion of any necessary debt refinancings. Approval by the Company's
shareholders is not required as a condition to the consummation of the Proposed Separation. Tyco has received an initial private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Proposed Separation noting it will qualify for favorable tax treatment. Tyco expects to file Registration Statements in connection with the Proposed
Separation during the second quarter of 2007. Following the Proposed Separation, Tyco's shareholders will own 100% of the equity in all three companies through tax-free stock
dividends.

We
are also focused on growing profitability within each of these companies so that each may be well positioned for long-term growth as independent businesses. Following the
Proposed Separation, we expect that all three companies will be dividend-paying companies. As we prepare for the Proposed Separation, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and
will complete the


remainder
of the $2.0 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006.

We
are a high-quality, low-cost producer and provider in each of the markets we serve. We promote our leadership positions by investing in existing businesses and
developing new markets. Our business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency primarily through new product innovation, increased market share, and continued geographic
expansion. We have implemented and will continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our businesses to achieve best-in-class operating practices. We also
remain committed to being a leader in corporate governance so that we can maintain the respect and confidence of our shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers as well as the financial
community.

Over
the past several years, the Company has engaged in a series of restructuring programs through which we have made our operations more efficient, including exiting certain
non-core businesses or business lines and streamlining general operations. During 2006, we completed the sale of our Plastics and Adhesives segment and entered into a definitive agreement
to sell the Printed Circuit Group ("PCG") business, a business of the Electronics segment. As such, the operations of the Plastics and Adhesives segment and PCG are reflected as discontinued
operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

To
further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we have launched a restructuring program across all segments including the corporate organization which will
streamline some of the businesses and reduce our operational footprint. We expect to incur charges of approximately $600 million over the next two years, of which $500 million is
expected to be incurred in 2007. We expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately $450 million, of which $250 million is expected in 2007. We believe
this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term.

Segments

See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain segment and geographic financial data relating to our business.

I.    Electronics

Tyco is the world's leading supplier of passive electronic components. With 2006 net revenue of $12.7 billion, our Electronics businesses comprise 31% of
our consolidated net revenue. In 2005 and 2004, net revenue totaled $11.8 billion or 30% of our consolidated net revenue and $11.4 billion or 30% of our consolidated net revenue,
respectively. The group's products and services include:

•

heat shrink products, circuit protection devices, magnetic devices, wire and cable, relays, sensors, touch screens, identification and labeling products, power systems and components, electronic
modules, application tooling, switches and battery assemblies.

Tyco
Electronics consists of four business units: Electronic Components, Wireless, Power Systems and Submarine Telecommunications.

With
the exception of Submarine Telecommunications, these businesses design, manufacture and market a broad range of electronic, electrical and electro-optic passive and active devices
and a number of interconnection systems and connector-intensive assemblies, as well as wireless products including radar sensors, global positioning satellite systems components, private radio
systems, silicon and gallium arsenide semiconductors and microwave sub-systems. These products have potential uses wherever an electronic, electrical, computer or telecommunications system
is involved. Products are sold under the


AMP,
AGASTAT, AXICOM, AUGAT, CRITCHLEY, DULMISON, ELO-TOUCH SYSTEMS, M/A-COM, RAYCHEM and TYCO ELECTRONICS trade names, among others.

Sales
and marketing are done via direct sales and distributors to customers including original equipment manufacturers and their subcontractors, utilities, government agencies,
value-added resellers and those who install, maintain and repair equipment. In 2006, the group's direct sales represented 85% of net revenue while the remaining net revenue was via distributors. Their
customers are found in the automotive, communications equipment manufacturing, telecommunications service, computer, aerospace, military, household appliance, industrial machinery and equipment,
instrumentation, consumer electronics, energy and networking industries. In total, these businesses serve over 250,000 customers located in over 150 countries and maintain a strong local presence in
the geographic areas in
which they operate, including the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.

Tyco
Submarine Telecommunications is a leading provider of services for undersea fiber optic networks. Tyco Submarine Telecommunications' products and services include designing,
manufacturing and installing undersea cable communications systems and servicing and maintaining major undersea cable networks.

Tyco
Electronics operates in highly competitive markets. The competition experienced across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to
small, highly specialized manufacturers. Competition is on the basis of breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality and service.

II.    Fire and Security

Tyco is the world's leading provider of both electronic security services and fire protection contracting and services. With 2006 net revenue of
$11.7 billion, our Fire and Security businesses comprise 28% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2005 and 2004, net revenue totaled $11.5 billion or 29% of our consolidated net revenue
and $11.5 billion or 30% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. The group's principal products and services include:

•

designing,
manufacturing, installing, monitoring and servicing electronic security systems for residential, commercial and government customers; and

•

designing,
manufacturing, installing and servicing a broad line of fire detection suppression systems for commercial and government market segments.

Tyco
Fire and Security consists of two business units: Worldwide Electronic Security Services and Worldwide Fire Protection Contracting and Services.

Worldwide Electronic Security Services

We are the world's leading provider of electronic security services, which includes the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms, medical alert systems, and
other activities where around-the-clock monitoring and response are required. We offer regular inspection and maintenance services to ensure that systems will function properly
and can be upgraded as technology or risk profiles change. We are also a leading supplier of electronic security product solutions to the retail, commercial and government markets, offering
anti-theft, video surveillance, access control, electronic asset protection and security management systems, products and services. These and other security services are provided
principally through our ADT operating companies.

Electronically
monitored security systems are tailored to our customers' specific needs and involve the installation of devices designed for intrusion detection and access control, as
well as reaction to various occurrences or conditions, such as movement, fire, smoke, flooding, environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These detection devices are connected
to microprocessor-based


control
panels, which communicate to one of our monitoring centers (located remotely from the customer's premises) where alarm and supervisory signals are received and recorded. In most systems,
control panels can identify the nature of the alarm and the areas within a building where the sensor was activated. Depending upon the type of service for which the subscriber has contracted,
monitoring center personnel respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to the local fire or police departments, notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action, such as
dispatching employees to the customer's premises. In some instances, the customer may monitor the system at its own premises or the system may be connected to local fire or police departments.

Whether
systems are monitored by the customer at its premises or connected to one of our monitoring centers, we usually provide support and maintenance through service contracts. Systems
installed at customers' premises may be owned by us or by our customers.

We
market our electronic security services to commercial and residential customers through both a direct sales force and an authorized dealer network. A separate national accounts sales
force services large commercial customers. We also utilize advertising, the Internet and direct mail to market our services.

We
provide residential and commercial electronic security services primarily in North America, Latin America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. Our commercial
customers include financial institutions, industrial and commercial businesses, federal, state and local governments, retailers, and health care and educational facilities. Our customers are often
prompted to purchase
security systems by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition to coverage. Some
municipalities are requiring verification as a prerequisite for police response to intrusion alarms. It has been our experience that the majority of commercial and residential monitoring contracts are
renewed after their initial terms. In general, relocations account for the largest number of residential discontinuances while business closures comprise the largest single factor impacting commercial
contract attrition.

We
are also the leader in anti-theft systems. The majority of the world's leading retailers use our systems to protect against shoplifting and employee theft. We manufacture
these SENSORMATIC electronic article surveillance systems and generally sell them through our direct sales force in North and South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. A growing
trend in the loss protection industry is for security labels to be applied to goods at the point of manufacture. In most cases, we sell these labels directly to the manufacturers or their packaging
agents.

We
also develop and distribute a full line of access control and video surveillance systems, which are sold through direct and distributor/integrator channels. These products range from
access control systems designed for small businesses to integrated solutions used by some of the world's largest global enterprises.

We
manufacture certain alarm, detection and activation devices and central monitoring station equipment both for installation by us and for sale to other installers. We also outsource
some of the electronic components we install.

The
security business in North America is highly competitive, with a number of major firms and some 10,000 smaller regional and local companies. Similarly, Tyco competes with several
national companies and several thousand regional and local companies in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and South Africa.

Worldwide Fire Protection Contracting and Services

We design, fabricate, install and service automatic fire sprinkler systems, fire alarm and detection systems and special hazard suppression systems in buildings,
industrial plants and off-shore installations, as well as respiratory systems and other life-saving devices. Tyco's fire protection businesses utilize a


worldwide
network of sales offices, operating globally under various trade names including SIMPLEXGRINNELL, WORMALD, DONG BANG, ANSUL, SCOTT, SABRE and TYCO.

We
install fire protection systems in both new and existing buildings. Our fire protection systems are purchased by owners, construction engineers and mechanical or general contractors.
In recent years, the retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire protection systems, especially in hotels, healthcare facilities,
educational establishments and other buildings accessible to the general public. We continue to focus on system maintenance and inspection, which have become more significant parts of our business.

The
majority of the fire suppression systems installed by Tyco are water-based. However, we are also the world's leading provider of custom designed special hazard fire protection
systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases, in addition to spill control products designed to absorb, neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous
materials. These systems are often especially suited to fire protection in certain manufacturing, power generation, petrochemical, offshore oil exploration, transportation, data processing,
telecommunications, commercial food preparation, mining and marine applications.

We
manufacture and distribute SCOTT and SABRE breathing systems for use by firefighters and other first responders and for industrial applications. Military forces from various countries
use our breathing apparatus and more than one million U.S. firefighters rely on our SCOTT AIR-PAK brand of self-contained breathing apparatus. SCOTT and SABRE products are sold
globally through a network of distributors and are subject to government funding availability. SCOTT is considered the world leader in respiratory protection innovation for first responders.

In
Asia and Europe, Tyco designs, installs and maintains integrated systems which monitor and manage urban traffic control systems, as well as lighting, ventilation, fire detection,
surveillance and traffic control for bridges, tunnels, railways and mines.

A
significant portion of the mechanical components (and, in North America, a high proportion of the pipe) used in our fire protection systems are purchased from Tyco Engineered Products
and Services. We use computer-aided-design technology that reduces the time required to design systems for specific applications and coordinates the fabrication and delivery of system components.

Competition
in the fire protection contracting business varies by region. In North America, Tyco competes with thousands of smaller contractors on a regional or local basis for the
installation of fire protection, alarm and detection systems. In Europe, Tyco competes with many regional or local contractors on a country-by-country basis. In Australia, New
Zealand and Asia, we compete with a few large fire protection contractors, as well as with many smaller regional or local companies. Tyco competes for fire protection systems contracts primarily on
the basis of price, service and quality.

III.    Healthcare

Tyco is a global leader in the medical products industry. With 2006, 2005 and 2004 net revenue of $9.6 billion, $9.5 billion and
$9.1 billion, respectively, our Healthcare businesses comprised 24% of our consolidated net revenue in each year. The group's products include:

We are a large buyer of steel in the United States. We are also a large buyer of other commodities, including, resin, copper, brass, gold, paper, pulp and cotton.
Certain of the components used in the Fire Protection business, principally certain valves and fittings, are purchased for installation in fire protection systems or for distribution. Materials are
purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. There have been no shortages in materials which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. However, significant
increases in certain raw material costs may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins. We enter into long-term supply contracts, using fixed or variable pricing to manage our
exposure to potential supply disruptions.

Patents and Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, which principally relate to electrical and electronic products, healthcare products, fire protection devices, electronic security
systems, flow control products, tubing and building and cable products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products
extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially
extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. All capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, the Company
or its subsidiaries. Although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future, in the opinion of management the loss of any single patent or trademark would not
materially affect the conduct of the business in any of our segments.


Employees

Tyco employed 238,200 people at September 29, 2006, of which 86,900 are employed in the United States and 151,300 are outside the United States. We have
collective bargaining agreements with labor unions covering 38,800 employees at certain of our North American, European and Asia-Pacific businesses. We believe that our relations with the
labor unions are generally good.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things, the generation,
storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. The cost of compliance with
environmental laws, however, has not had, and based on current information and applicable laws, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions
at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the
cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental
contamination resulting from past operations.

Given
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods, the ultimate cost of cleanup at
disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial
costs in the range of approximately $124 million to $406 million. As of September 29, 2006, we believe that the best estimate
within this range is approximately $184 million, of which $34 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $150 million is included in other
long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $184 million, we believe that any potential
payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are
not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions,
geopolitical events and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our
liquidity.

Risks Relating to the Proposed Separation

The cost to complete the transaction could be significant.

Management estimates that the total net economic cost to complete the Proposed Separation is expected to approximate $1.0 billion and that the
corresponding income statement charges would be larger than net economic cost. However, actual costs could exceed that estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
and cash flows.

We may be unable to complete the transaction.

There is no guarantee that the Proposed Separation will be finalized. Completion of the Proposed Separation is subject to a number of factors and conditions,
including:

•

changes
in business, political and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries in which the Company currently operates;

•

changes
in governmental regulations and policies and actions of regulatory bodies;

•

changes
in operating performance of the Company;

•

required
changes to existing financings, and changes in credit ratings, including those that may result from the Proposed Separation;

•

the
Company's ability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the Proposed Separation; and

•

the
Company's ability to satisfy certain conditions precedent, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of
counsel and the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the SEC.


Increased demands on our management team as a result of the Proposed Separation could distract management's attention from operating the business.

Management expects to file Registration Statements in connection with the Proposed Separation during the second quarter of 2007. The complexity of the transaction
will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources, as well as the use of several cross-functional project teams. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected
during the transition period.

Each of the independent companies resulting from the completion of the Proposed Separation may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect will be achieved from the separation
transactions.

Each of the independent companies may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect will result from the separation of two of Tyco's
segments into independent companies or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. For example, there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will regard the corporate structures of
each of the independent companies as more clear and simple than the current Tyco corporate structure or place a greater value on the sum of each of the independent companies as compared to Tyco.

If certain internal restructuring transactions and the distribution relating to the Proposed Separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that
are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

We anticipate that certain internal restructuring transactions will be undertaken in preparation for the Proposed Separation. These transactions are complex and
could cause us to incur significant tax liabilities. We have an initial private letter ruling regarding these transactions and the distribution from the IRS noting that they qualify for favorable tax
treatment. We have also requested or may request supplemental rulings regarding these transactions and, in addition, we expect to obtain an opinion of tax counsel confirming the favorable tax
treatment of these transactions. The ruling and the opinion rely or will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings, from us regarding the past and future conduct of our
businesses and other matters. If any of these are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, then we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion and could be subject to
significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal restructuring transactions should be treated as taxable
transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or if the distributions should become taxable for other
reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership after the distribution.

Risks Relating to Actions of Tyco's Former Senior Corporate Management

Pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.

As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of our former senior corporate management, current and former members
of our Board of Directors and our current Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Financial Officer and current General Counsel are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging
violations of certain disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco, certain of our current and former employees, some members of our former senior corporate management and some former
members of the Board of Directors of Tyco International (US), Inc. also are named as defendants in several ERISA class actions. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and
officers and our former directors and officers who are also named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda


law.
In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to
estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in
aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable
losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Continued scrutiny resulting from ongoing governmental investigations may have an adverse effect on our business.

We and others have received subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the United States Department of Labor, the General Service Administration and others seeking the
production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. Certain current and former employees in Fire
and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices regarding the ADT dealer connect fees. As previously reported in our
periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued. The United States Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of our benefit plans. At this time, we cannot
predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to
injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non-governmental customers)
or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot provide assurance that the effects and results of these or other investigations will not be
material and adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities,
including the United States IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and
other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision, equity or goodwill, as appropriate. The calculation of our tax
liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and
record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due.
These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.

In
connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 through 2000, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to its 1997 through 2000 U.S. federal income tax returns. During
2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. These adjustments did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

During
2006, the Company has developed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined
that


acceptance
of these adjustments is probable and accordingly has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.

We estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. In
making this estimate, we have not
assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with our pending litigation or investigations. Any material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from our
pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the
additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Such
an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

require
us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, including debt reduction or dividend payments;

•

increase
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict
our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;

•

make
it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and

•

increase
the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.

Additional negative publicity may adversely affect our business.

As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco was the subject of continuing negative publicity focusing on these actions. This
negative publicity contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities in 2002 and brought increased regulatory scrutiny upon us. Additional negative publicity related
to former senior corporate management's actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our publicly traded securities.

Our senior corporate management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management.

We replaced our senior corporate executives with a new team during 2002 through 2004, and all of the former members of our Board of Directors determined not to
stand for reelection in March 2003. A new Board of Directors was elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2003. We cannot provide assurance that this major
restructuring of our Board of Directors and senior


management
team, and the accompanying distractions related to matters arising from the actions of prior management will not adversely affect our results of operations.

Risks Relating to Our Businesses

Cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our operating results in some of our segments are affected adversely by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which they operate. For example, demand
for the products and services of Fire and
Security and Engineered Products and Services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending. Also, the electronic components business
within Electronics is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand patterns of these markets, which could impact the margins in this business. This
cyclical impact can be amplified because some of our businesses purchase products from other of our businesses. For example, Fire and Security purchases certain products sold by Engineered Products
and Services. Therefore, a drop in demand for our fire prevention products due to lower new residential or office construction or other factors can cause a drop in demand for certain of our products
sold by Engineered Products and Services.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:

•

the
generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions
or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the
health and safety of our employees.

There
can be no assurances that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.

We
have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where we and others
disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and /or for
natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.
These projects relate to a variety of activities, including:

•

radioactive
materials decontamination and decommissioning;

•

solvent,
metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and


•

oil
spill equipment upgrades and replacement.

These
projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us.

The
ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial
costs (including asset retirement obligations of $111 million) of approximately $295 million, of which $34 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities
and $261 million is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more
stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or
future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or
future business activities.

We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.

Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill, intangibles and other
long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating
results of reporting units, divestitures, the Proposed Separation plan and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. Future impairment
charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges. In addition, such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders' equity, increasing our
debt-to-total-capitalization ratio. Such reduction in consolidated net worth and increase in debt as a percentage of total capitalization could result in a default under our
credit facilities.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. See
Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our
net revenue derived from sales in non-U.S. markets for 2006 was 51.2% of our total net revenue, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to
represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro, our
U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of
operations. Our financial statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. Dollars, our functional currency.

We
are a large buyer of steel in the United States. We are also a large buyer of other commodities, including resin, copper, brass, gold, paper, pulp and cotton. Volatility in the prices
of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass


on
these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

We
monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we purchase hedges or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations
from these fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are named as a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In the ordinary course of business, we are named as a defendant in a significant amount of litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of
intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior and product liability litigation. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws
permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. In addition, our Healthcare business is subject to regulation and potential litigation. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our
management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or
other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our Healthcare business is subject to extensive regulation by the government and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products. Failure to comply
with current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead, and have led, to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls, product
shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products
could lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales.

Our ADT business may experience higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and has caused us to change the useful life of accounts, increasing our depreciation and
amortization expense.

Attrition rates for customers in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services business were 13.8%, 14.8% and 15.1% on a trailing 12-month basis as of
September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Although the attrition rate has been declining, if attrition rates were to trend upward, ADT's recurring revenue and
results of operations will be adversely affected. Tyco amortizes the costs of ADT's contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the ADT dealer program based on the estimated life of
the customer relationships. Internally generated residential and commercial account pools are similarly amortized. If the attrition rates were to rise Tyco may be required to accelerate the
amortization of the costs which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees or agents or those of our subsidiaries.

Tyco and its subsidiaries operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, including, but not limited to, Asia,
India, Latin America and Europe. Tyco's policy mandates strict compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government
officials. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees that would
violate U.S. and/or foreign laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials. Such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial
monetary fines, as well as disgorgement of profits or other monies, against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.

From
time to time Tyco obtains or receives information alleging improper conduct of Tyco employees, agents, and/or distributors, including conduct involving potentially improper payments
to foreign government officials. Tyco's policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, taking remedial control measures and reporting its findings to
relevant law enforcement authorities.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, minimum levels of net worth, and limits on incurrence of liens. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and
sale/leaseback transactions.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all
commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities
and our other indebtedness. Acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations. See "Liquidity
and Capital Resources—Capitalization".

Downgrades of our debt ratings would adversely affect us.

Certain downgrades by Moody's and S&P may increase our cost of capital and make it more difficult for us to obtain new financing.


Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislation and negative publicity regarding Bermuda companies could increase our tax burden and affect our operating results.

Legislation Relating to Government Contracts

We continue to assess the potential impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their corporate location abroad. The legislative proposals could cover the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited (a public company that
had been located in Bermuda since the 1980's with origins dating back to the United Kingdom since the early 1900's), as a result of which ADT changed its name to Tyco International Ltd. and
became the parent to the Tyco group.

In
addition, the U.S. federal government and various other states and municipalities have proposed or may propose legislation that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict with any level of certainty the likelihood or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of
regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the financial impact such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.

Tax Legislation

The United States Congress has in the past considered legislation affecting the tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation
transactions. In October 2004, the United States Congress enacted such legislation, which did not, however, retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd. by ADT
Limited. Legislation passed by the U.S. Senate on November 18, 2005 would modify parts of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, but would not retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of
Tyco International Ltd. by ADT Limited. We expect various U.S. Treasury Department studies to be released and tax proposals to be introduced in the United States Congress in the future and cannot
provide assurance that these proposals would not have adverse effects on Tyco if enacted. Such adverse effects could include substantially reducing the tax benefits of our corporate structure,
materially increasing our tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our business.

Negative Publicity

There is continuing negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, U.S. companies' use of, or relocation to, offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. As a
Bermuda company, this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of the
negative public image of Bermuda companies or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a Bermuda company.

Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We are organized under the laws of Bermuda. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Bermuda based on the
civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts
obtained against us or our directors or officers


based
on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and
Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money
rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Bermuda.

As
a Bermuda company, Tyco is governed by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and
shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of
a Bermuda company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies do not generally have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may only
exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company in limited circumstances. Under Bermuda law, a company may also agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability, not
involving fraud or dishonesty, incurred in relation to the company. Thus, holders of Tyco securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a
corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

Our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world aggregating approximately 107 million square feet of floor space, of which approximately
58 million square feet are owned and approximately 49 million square feet are leased. These facilities house manufacturing, distribution and warehousing operations, as well as sales and
marketing, engineering and administrative offices.

Fire
and Security operates through a network of offices located in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and South
Africa. Our Fire and Security manufacturing facilities are located in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific region. The group occupies approximately 18 million square feet, of
which 4 million square feet are owned and 14 million square feet are leased.

Electronics
has manufacturing facilities in North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The group occupies approximately 31 million square feet, of which
20 million square feet are owned and 11 million square feet are leased.

Healthcare
has manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The group occupies approximately 22 million square feet, of which 13 million
square feet are owned and 9 million square feet are leased.

Engineered
Products and Services has manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers throughout North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Central and
South America. The group occupies approximately 36 million square feet, of which 21 million square feet are owned and 15 million square feet are leased.


In the opinion of management, our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing
leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. See Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our lease obligations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Securities Class Actions

As previously reported in our 2005 Form 10-K, Tyco and certain of our former directors and officers have been named as defendants in over 40
securities class actions. Most of the securities class actions have now been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. On January 28, 2003, a consolidated securities class action complaint was filed in these proceedings. On January 7, 2005,
the Company answered the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint. On January 14, 2005, lead plaintiffs made a motion for class certification, which the Company opposed on July 22, 2005. On
July 5, 2005, the Company moved for revision of the Court's October 14, 2004 order in light of a change in law, insofar as the order denied the Company's motion to dismiss the
consolidated complaint for failure to plead loss causation. On December 2, 2005, the Court denied the Company's motion. On April 4, 2006 plaintiffs filed a partial motion for summary
judgment that was denied without prejudice to its later renewal. On June 12, 2006, the Court entered an order certifying a class "consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or
otherwise acquired Tyco securities between December 13, 1999 and June 7, 2002, and who were damaged thereby, excluding defendants, all of the officers, directors and partners thereof,
members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which any of the foregoing have or had a controlling interest." On June 26,
2006, Tyco filed a petition for leave to appeal the class certification order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Separately, on September 22, 2006, the United States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Tyco's petition. On July 6, 2006, the lead plaintiffs filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire a motion for a
permanent injunction against prosecution of the class action styled

Brazen v. Tyco International Ltd.

that was certified by the Circuit Court for
Cook County, Illinois. On October 26, 2006, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion for injunction release without prejudice.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, a class action complaint,

Ezra Charitable Trust v. Tyco International Ltd.

, was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 28, 2003. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Thereafter, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. On December 22, 2004, plaintiff moved to amend the complaint. The proposed amendment
asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against Tyco International Ltd. and Edward
Breen, our current Chief Executive Officer, and seeks to add as defendants David FitzPatrick, our former Chief Financial Officer, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our former independent auditors. As
against defendants Breen and FitzPatrick, the complaint asserts a cause of action under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On March 25, 2005, the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted plaintiff's motion to amend. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint that day. On March 28, 2005, the Court denied defendants' motion to
dismiss the original complaint, without prejudice to the defendants' ability to move against the amended complaint. On April 25, 2005, defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended class
action complaint. On September 2, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire entered a Memorandum and Order dismissing the amended complaint. On October 18,
2005, plaintiff filed a notice to appeal in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On September 27, 2006, the United States


Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the amended class action complaint.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, an action entitled

Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.,

was filed on
June 3, 2004 in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against certain of our former directors and officers, our former auditors and Tyco. On
October 25, 2006, the Court lifted its previous order staying the case during the pendency of a related arbitration to which Tyco was not a party. Now that the stay has been lifted, Tyco
intends to ask the Court to dismiss the action.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted one plaintiff's motion for appointment as lead plaintiff in

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd.,

an action originally filed on July 28, 2003 and

O'Loughlin v. Tyco
International Ltd.,

an action originally filed on September 26, 2003. On December 13, 2004, lead plaintiff Mark Newby filed a consolidated securities class
action complaint purporting to represent a class of purchasers of TyCom securities between July 26, 2000 and December 17, 2001. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco
International Ltd., TyCom, Ltd., Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated and Citigroup Inc., (the "Underwriters") along with certain
former Tyco and TyCom executives. The complaint asserts causes of action under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against Tyco, TyCom, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and certain former Tyco and TyCom executives. The complaint alleges the TyCom
registration statement and prospectus relating to the sale of TyCom securities were inaccurate, misleading and failed to disclose facts necessary to make the registration statement and prospectus not
misleading. Further, the complaint alleges the defendants violated securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, executive
compensation, Tyco's and TyCom's finances and TyCom's business prospects. On February 18, 2005, the Company moved to
dismiss the consolidated securities class action complaint. On September 2, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted in part and denied in part the
Company's motion to dismiss. The Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss allegations that the TyCom registration statement and prospectus were misleading to the extent that they failed to
disclose alleged looting of Tyco by former senior executives, accounting fraud, analyst conflicts and the participation by James Brennan in the offering, because plaintiffs failed to plead that those
alleged omissions were disclosed during the class period, with a resultant drop in the value of TyCom stock. However, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss with respect to other
allegations. On September 19, 2005, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's September 2, 2005 ruling with respect to Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated and Citigroup Inc. On January 6, 2006, the Court held that the Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
Incorporated and Citigroup Inc. should remain in the case on the claim concerning TyCom's business prospects, but that the Section 11 claim related to alleged looting of Tyco by former
senior executives was dismissed as to both the Tyco defendants and the Underwriters because the affirmative defense of lack of loss causation was apparent on the face of the complaint. On
January 13, 2006, Tyco International Ltd. and TyCom answered the consolidated securities class action complaint. On March 8, 2006, the plaintiff filed a motion for class
certification. That motion has been fully briefed and is still pending.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on November 27, 2002 the State of New Jersey, on behalf of several state pension funds, filed a complaint,

New Jersey v. Tyco

, in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey against Tyco, our former auditors and certain of our former
officers and directors. On February 11, 2005, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint against Tyco, our former auditors, and certain of our former directors and officers. As against all
defendants, the amended complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of


and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, for common law fraud, aiding and abetting common law fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Claims are
asserted against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 24(d) of the New Jersey
Uniform Securities Law, Sections 421-B:25(II) & (III) of the New Hampshire Uniform Securities Law, and for breaches of fiduciary duties. Claims are also asserted against
certain of the individual defendants under Section 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and for violation of the New Jersey RICO statute; against Tyco under Section 12(a)(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933, Section 24(c) of the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law, and for violation of, aiding and abetting violation of, and vicarious liability under the New Jersey RICO
statute; against Tyco and certain of the individual defendants under Section 14(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and for conspiracy to
violate the New Jersey RICO statute; against Tyco, our former auditors, and certain of the individual defendants under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, and for violation of, and
conspiracy to violate the New Jersey RICO statute; and against our former auditors and certain of the individual defendants for aiding and abetting violation of the New Jersey RICO statute. Finally,
claims are asserted against the individual defendants and our former auditors for aiding and abetting the individual defendants' breaches of fiduciary duties. The Second Amended Complaint asserts that
the defendants violated the securities laws and otherwise engaged in fraudulent acts by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, the following:
unauthorized and improper compensation of certain of our former executives; their improper use of our funds for personal benefit and their improper self-dealing in real estate. On
June 10, 2005, the Company moved to dismiss in part the Second Amended Complaint, which motion remains pending before the Court.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, the Company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit the decision of the United States District Court for the
District of New Hampshire to remand

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on March 10, 2005, plaintiff Lionel I. Brazen filed an amended class action complaint in the Circuit Court for Cook County,
Illinois purporting to represent a class of purchasers who exchanged shares of Mallinckrodt, Inc. common stock for shares of Tyco common stock pursuant to the Joint Proxy Statement and
Prospectus, and the Registration Statement in which it was included, in connection with the October 17, 2000 merger of Tyco and Mallinckrodt, Inc. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco
International Ltd., and certain former Tyco executives and asserts causes of action under Section 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The amended class action complaint
alleges that the defendants made statements in the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and Prospectus that were materially false and misleading and failed to disclose material adverse
facts regarding the business and operations of Tyco. On April 21, 2005, the Company moved in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois to dismiss or stay or, in the alternative, to strike the
class allegations. On July 22, 2005, the Court denied the Company's motion. Also, on July 22, 2005, the Court granted the motion to dismiss individual defendants Michael A.


Ashcroft,
Joshua M. Berman, Richard S. Bodman, John F. Fort, III, Stephen W. Foss, James S. Pasman Jr., W. Peter Slusser and Frank E. Walsh, Jr. On August 2, 2005, Tyco filed a motion for a
finding pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 308(a), which was denied on August 16, 2005. On August 19, 2005, Tyco filed an interlocutory appeal of the Circuit Court for Cook County
Illinois' July 22, 2005 memorandum and order. On December 27, 2005, the Appellate Court of Illinois, First Judicial District, denied Tyco's interlocutory appeal. On January 31,
2006, the Company filed a petition for leave to appeal the decision of the appellate court, but that petition was denied. On January 6, 2006, the plaintiff filed a renewed motion for class
certification which was granted. On February 14, 2006, Tyco filed its answer to the complaint. On July 5, 2006, plaintiffs filed a partial motion for summary judgment which was denied on
November 8, 2006. On November 22, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the denial of their motion for summary judgment. Briefing is ongoing.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on April 29, 2005, an action was filed against Tyco in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,

Slusser and Joseph Welch. The complaint asserts causes of action under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The
complaint alleges that defendants made material misrepresentations that resulted in artificially deflated stock prices. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to
the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

On
January 31, 2003 a civil action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

Cirella v. Tyco International et
al

. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco International Ltd., Dennis Kozlowski, Mark H. Swartz and Mark A. Belnick. Plaintiff Philip M. Cirella alleges that he was a
shareholder in CIT who received common shares of Tyco when it acquired CIT in 2000, and later purchased additional Tyco shares with Marguerite Cirella. Plaintiffs assert a cause of action against all
defendants for violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a cause of action against the individual defendants for violation of
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose related-party transactions, including the following: providing interest free loans, forgiving
personal loans, purchasing personal properties, using company funds to purchase personal items, selling individual Tyco shares while concealing information from investors, and failing to disclose an
ongoing criminal investigation of Kozlowski, all of which resulted in an artificially inflated share price. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and costs against all defendants and punitive exemplary
damages against the individual defendants. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred the action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

As

pro se

plaintiff named as additional defendants

Act of 1933. Plaintiff also asserts common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unfair trade practice, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and violation of
Section 1-402 of the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972. Tyco has removed the complaint to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. The plaintiff has moved to vacate the conditional transfer order.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation was notified that

Hall v. Kozlowski

may be
an action that should be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Thereafter, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the
United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On March 16, 2005, Tyco International (US) Inc. answered plaintiff's amended complaint.


Shareholder Derivative Litigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, an action was filed on June 7, 2002 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,

Levin v.
Kozlowski

, alleging that the individually named defendants breached their fiduciary duties, committed waste and mismanagement and engaged in
self-dealing in connection with Tyco's accounting practices, individual board members' use of funds, and the financial disclosures of certain mergers and acquisitions. It is further
alleged that certain of the individual defendants converted corporate assets for their own use. Plaintiffs seek money damages. Plaintiffs agreed to stay that action pending the resolution of the
federal derivative action, which was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire on October 14, 2004; and the appeal from that ruling was voluntarily
dismissed on May 19, 2005. On June 14, 2005, the plaintiffs resumed the

Levin

action. On September 22, 2005, the Company filed a
motion to dismiss the derivative complaint. On November 14, 2006, the Supreme Court of the State of New York dismissed the complaint with prejudice.

ERISA Litigation and Investigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco and certain of our current and former employees, officers and directors, have been named as defendants in
eight class actions brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Two of the actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire and the six remaining
actions were transferred to that court by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. All eight actions have been consolidated in the District Court in New Hampshire. The complaints purported to
bring claims on behalf of the Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans and the participants therein. On January 12, 2005, the United States District Court for
the District of New Hampshire denied, without prejudice, the Company's motion to dismiss certain additional individual defendants from the action. On January 20, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a motion
for class certification. On January 27, 2005, the Company answered the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint. Also, on January 28, 2005, the Company and certain individual defendants filed
a motion for reconsideration of the Court's January 12, 2005 order, insofar as it related to the Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement Committee. On May 25, 2005, the Court
denied the motion for reconsideration. On July 11, 2005, the Company and certain individual defendants opposed plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On August 15, 2006, the Court
entered an order certifying a class "consisting of all Participants in the Plans for whose individual accounts the Plans purchased
and/or held shares of Tyco Stock Fund at any time from August 12, 1998 to July 25, 2002." On August 29, 2006, Tyco filed a petition for leave to appeal the class certification
order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On November 13, 2006, the Court denied Tyco's petition.

In
addition, Tyco and certain of our current and former executives have received requests from the United States Department of Labor for information concerning the administration of the
Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans. The current focus of the Department's inquiry concerns losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in our
shares. The Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on behalf of the plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the plans for recovery of losses and additional
penalties, although it has not informed us of any intention to do so.

Tyco Litigation Against Former Senior Management

Tyco International, Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, United States District Court, Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-7317, filed September 12, 2002, Amended April 1, 2003.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil
complaint against our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The Company amended that complaint on April 1, 2003. The amended
complaint alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars


from
our Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program; awarded millions of dollars in unauthorized bonuses to himself and certain other Tyco employees; engaged in improper self-dealing
real estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco employees in committing these acts. The amended complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary
duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, conversion, constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The amended complaint seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of
the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's conduct, and of all remuneration, including restricted and unrestricted shares and options, obtained by Mr. Kozlowski during the course of this
conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Mr. Kozlowski
filed a motion to dismiss or stay the case and compel arbitration, which was denied on March 16, 2004, with one exception relating to the arbitration of a claim asserting the fraudulent
inducement of Mr. Kozlowski's retention agreement. On April 9, 2004, Mr. Kozlowski filed an Answer, Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims, seeking amounts allegedly due pursuant
to his purported retention agreement, life insurance policies, and other arrangements. Tyco filed its Reply to the Counterclaims on April 29, 2004. Discovery in this and the other affirmative
cases is proceeding.

Mr. Kozlowski
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of
Mr. Kozlowski began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to
it, which were similar to certain of the claims alleged in the Company's affirmative action described above, the jury found Mr. Kozlowski guilty on all charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and
securities fraud, and all but one count of falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Kozlowski was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight and
one-third years to twenty-five years, and ordered to pay an individual fine of $70 million and restitution, jointly and severally with Mr. Swartz, to Tyco of
$134 million within one year. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Kozlowski filed a notice of appeal from his conviction and on October 3, 2006 filed a brief in support of his
appeal. Tyco has initiated the process of collecting the restitution payment owed to it, and on November 17, 2006, the Supreme Court of the State of New York ordered $98 million to be
released from an escrow account under the supervision of the Manhattan District Attorney to Tyco on January 2, 2007.

Tyco International, Ltd. v. Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 03-CV-2247
(TPG), filed April 1, 2003.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed an arbitration claim against Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and
director, on October 7, 2002. As a consequence of Mr. Swartz's refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association, we filed a civil complaint against him on
April 1, 2003, for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The action alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from our Key Employees Loan Program and
relocation program; approved and implemented awards of millions of dollars of unauthorized bonuses to himself and certain other Tyco employees; awarded millions of dollars in unauthorized payments to
himself; engaged in improper self dealing real estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco employees in committing these acts. The complaint alleges causes
of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, conversion, and constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The action seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a
result of the former Chief Financial Officer and director's conduct, and all remuneration, including restricted and unrestricted shares and options, obtained by Mr. Swartz's during the course
of this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Mr. Swartz moved to dismiss Tyco's
complaint and to compel arbitration of the parties' respective claims. The court denied Swartz's motion and he has appealed the court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit. His appeal was heard on December 8, 2004. The First Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision on September 7, 2005. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is
proceeding.


Mr. Swartz
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of Mr. Swartz
began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to it, which were similar to certain of the
claims alleged in the Company's affirmative action described above, the jury found Mr. Swartz guilty on all charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and securities fraud, and all but one count of
falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Swartz was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight and one-third years to twenty-five years,
and ordered to pay an individual fine of $35 million and restitution, jointly and severally with Mr. Kozlowski, to Tyco of $134 million within one year. On September 19,
2005, Mr. Swartz filed a notice of appeal from his conviction and on October 3, 2006 filed a brief in support of his appeal. On October 27, 2006, Mr. Swartz paid
restitution to the Company in the amount of $38 million.

Tyco International, Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-9705, filed December 6, 2002.

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against our former
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer and Director pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 for disgorgement of short-swing profits
from prohibited transactions in our common shares believed to exceed $40 million. The action seeks disgorgement of profits, interest, attorney's fees and costs. The Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz moved to
dismiss the claims against them based upon the statute of limitations. On March 16, 2004, Judge Barbadoro in the District of New Hampshire granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part with
leave for Tyco to file an amended complaint. Tyco filed an amended complaint on May 14, 2004. The defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the amended complaint on June 28, 2004.
The defendants' motion to dismiss was denied on April 21, 2005. The defendants' motion to extend time to answer the complaint until thirty days after the conclusion of deliberations in the
criminal trial was granted on May 17, 2005. Both defendants' filed their answers on July 18, 2005.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Frank E. Walsh, Jr., United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 02-CV-4633,
filed June 17, 2002.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against a former director for breach of fiduciary duty and related
wrongful conduct involving a $20 million payment in connection with a 2001 acquisition by Tyco. The action alleges causes of action for restitution, breach of fiduciary duty and inducing breach
of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and a constructive trust, and seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of the defendant director's conduct. On
December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco, which was deposited by the Company in January 2003, as a result of a plea bargain agreement with the
New York County District Attorney. Our claims against Mr. Walsh are still pending. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for
the District of New Hampshire. Discovery in this and the other affirmative cases is proceeding.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Mark A. Belnick,

No. 02-CV-4644 (SWK)

, filed
June 17, 2002.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against our former Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Counsel for
breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. On October 21, 2002, in a related proceeding, Mr. Belnick commenced an arbitration proceeding in New York County, New York. On
October 7, 2005, the Company and Mr. Belnick entered into a settlement agreement that resolved all claims each party had previously asserted against the other.

Tyco International Ltd. v. AIG Life of Bermuda Ltd. (formerly known as American General Life of Bermuda Ltd.); L. Dennis Kozlowski; and
Butterfield Trust (Bermuda) Limited, Index No. 2006: No. 82, filed on March 6, 2006 (amended April 6, 2006).

We filed a civil complaint in the
Supreme Court of Bermuda against our former Chief Executive Officer and others with respect to an insurance policy on the life of the former Chief Executive Officer issued by AIG Life of
Bermuda Ltd. and held in trust by Butterfield Trust (Bermuda) Limited, seeking declarations that Tyco was entitled to the premiums, proceeds and value of the policy. On September 27,
2006, Tyco, Mr. Kozlowski and the other parties entered into a confidential settlement that resolved the claims in this action, with a portion of the disputed funds
placed in escrow pending the resolution of the additional claims including those in the Multidistrict Litigation actions currently pending before the District Court for the District of New Hampshire.


Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the United States Department of Labor,
the General Service Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and
related controls. We are cooperating with these investigations and are complying with these requests.

Certain
current and former employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices for the ADT
dealer connect fees. As previously reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued.

The
United States Department of Labor served document subpoenas on Tyco and Fidelity Management Trust Company for documents concerning the administration of the Tyco International
(US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans. The current focus of the Department's inquiry concerns the losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in our stock. The
Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on behalf of the plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the plans for recovery of losses and additional penalties, although
it has not informed us of any intention to do so. The Company is continuing to cooperate with the Department's investigation.

As
previously disclosed, in November 2004, we received an order from the SEC to report facts and circumstances involving our participation, if any, in the United Nations Oil for
Food Program governing sales of Iraqi oil. On January 10, 2005 and November 8, 2005, we responded to the Order and provided information concerning transactions under the United Nations
Oil for Food Program. On January 31, 2006, we received a Subpoena from the SEC to produce additional documents and information related to the participation of three of our businesses in the Oil
for Food Program. The SEC notified the Company on June 7, 2006 that it was dismissing Tyco from the SEC's investigation of the United Nations Oil for Food Program.

On
January 27, 2006, we received from the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice Office of the Attorney General a subpoena to produce documents concerning, among other things,
former employees, the use of certain chemicals, and the filing of reports under state and federal environmental
reporting laws at the same New Jersey facility sold by Tyco in 2000. The subpoena seeks information for the period from January 1987 to December 2000. We have provided information in
response to the subpoena and will continue to cooperate fully with the investigators.

Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we are a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require us to pay damage awards.
Tyco has assessed the status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.

Mallinckrodt, Inc. ("Mallinckrodt") and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc. ("Nellcor"), plaintiffs/counter-defendants v. Masimo Corporation ("Masimo") et
al., defendants/counter-claimants,

is a consolidated patent infringement action filed on June 19, 2000 in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. Nellcor is a subsidiary of Tyco. Nellcor alleges that Masimo infringed one Nellcor patent related to pulse oximeters, which are medical devices used to measure blood oxygen levels in
patients, and Masimo alleges that Nellcor infringed four Masimo patents related to pulse oximeters. Trial in the action commenced on February 18, 2004. On March 16, 2004, the jury
returned a liability finding that Nellcor willfully infringed the four Masimo patents and that Masimo did not infringe the one Nellcor patent. On March 26, 2004, the jury awarded Masimo
$135 million in damages for Nellcor's alleged infringement through December 31, 2003. After hearing post-trial motions, the district court issued an order on July 14,
2004 which (i) denied Masimo's request to impose an injunction on the sale of pulse oximeters; (ii) reversed the jury finding of patent infringement for one of the four


patents
at issue; (iii) ruled that a second patent was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent; and (iv) overturned the jury finding that the infringement
was "willful." On August 6, 2004, the district court entered final judgment that included additional damages of $30 million for Nellcor's alleged infringement from January 1, 2004
through May 31, 2004. Nellcor asserts that Masimo infringes a second Nellcor patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,934,372—the "372 patent"). On April 8, 2005, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Nellcor's favor that reversed the district court's summary judgment finding of no infringement regarding the 372 patent claim against
Masimo. The Court of Appeals remanded Nellcor's 372 patent claim to the district court for further proceedings. The district court has not yet scheduled trial in the 372 case.

Nellcor
appealed the jury's infringement finding on the remaining two Masimo patents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On September 7, 2005, the Court
of Appeals issued a decision on the appeal that was adverse to Nellcor. In particular, the Court of Appeals: (1) affirmed the infringement finding against Nellcor on two patents;
(2) reversed the district court's ruling of non-infringement of a third patent; and (3) reversed the district court's ruling not to enter an injunction and directed the
district court to issue an injunction. The Court of Appeals also:
(1) affirmed the district court's ruling that Nellcor's infringement was not willful, which precluded Masimo from seeking up to treble damages; and (2) affirmed the district court's
ruling that one of Masimo's patents was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent. The Company has assessed the amount of potential additional damages and interest
accruing from the date of entry of final judgment to the present. Accordingly, during the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005, Tyco recorded a pre-tax charge of
$277 million related to this matter and does not expect to incur material losses beyond the amount accrued.

On
January 17, 2006, Tyco International Ltd., and its subsidiaries Tyco International (US) Inc., Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Mallinckrodt, Inc., and Nellcor
Puritan Bennett, Inc. (collectively "Nellcor") entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release of Claims with Masimo Corporation and Masimo Laboratories, Inc. (the "Settlement") related
to the consolidated patent infringement action.

Under
the terms of the Settlement, Tyco on behalf of Nellcor, paid Masimo a total of $330 million on January 19, 2006, which represents $265 million in damages in
the patent case for sales through January 31, 2006 (after which the infringing products will no longer be sold) and $65 million as an advance royalty for oximetry sales including
Nellcor's new 06 technology products from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The Settlement does not resolve the Masimo antitrust lawsuit or the related consumer antitrust class
lawsuits described below. Under the terms of the Settlement, Nellcor receives from Masimo a covenant not to sue on the Nellcor 06 products as well as a termination of all pending patent litigation
with Masimo. In March 2011, Nellcor has the option to terminate Masimo's covenant not to sue and the obligation to pay future royalties on Nellcor's current products as well as any
next-generation products. In addition, Nellcor shall discontinue making, offering to sell, selling or shipping any products that the court found infringed on the patents held by Masimo,
but will continue to provide service and sensors for the previously sold products.

Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP ("Tyco Healthcare") and Mallinckrodt, Inc.

is a separate lawsuit filed on
May 22, 2002 also pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt are subsidiaries of Tyco. In this lawsuit, Masimo alleges
violations of antitrust laws against Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximeter products. Masimo alleges that Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt used their market position to
prevent hospitals from purchasing Masimo's pulse oximetry products. Masimo seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages. Trial in this case began on February 22, 2005.
The jury returned its verdict on March 21, 2005, and awarded Masimo $140 million in damages. The damages are automatically trebled under the antitrust statute to an award of
$420 million. If ultimately successful, Masimo's attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees


and
costs in addition to the verdict amount. The district court held a hearing on June 28, 2005 regarding post-trial motions.

On
March 22, 2006, the district court issued its Memorandum of Decision regarding the post-trial motions. In the Memorandum, the district court (i) vacated the
jury's liability
findings on two business practices; (ii) affirmed the jury's liability finding on two other business practices; (iii) vacated the jury's damage award in its entirety; and
(iv) ordered a new trial on damages. The district court held the new trial on the damages on October 18 and 19, 2006. After post-trial briefing, the district court will issue
its decision regarding the amount of damages to be awarded.

Tyco
has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the jury's decision will be overturned, and, further, Tyco intends to vigorously pursue
all available means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to this damage award.

Beginning
on August 29, 2005 with

Natchitoches Parish Hospital Service District v. Tyco International, Ltd.,

twelve consumer
class actions have been filed against

Nellcor

recover overcharges they allege they paid for pulse oximetry products as a result of anticompetitive conduct by Nellcor in violation of the federal antitrust laws. The Company will respond to these
complaints and intends to vigorously defend the actions.

As
previously reported in the Company's periodic filings,

Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") v. United States Surgical ("U.S.
Surgical")

is a patent infringement action that was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in April 1999 in which U.S.
Surgical, a subsidiary of Tyco, is the defendant. In February 2002, the district court held that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL universal seal system, contained in certain surgical trocar and access
devices manufactured by U.S. Surgical, infringed certain of the plaintiff's patents. The district court entered a permanent injunction against U.S. Surgical based upon infringement of one of the three
patents involved in the suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's permanent injunction ruling in September 2003 for the VERSASEAL product,
which is no longer on the market. In October 2003, the district court ruled in U.S. Surgical's favor, holding that two other patents involved in the case were invalid. A trial on damages for
the earlier infringement ruling in the district court concluded on July 27, 2004. The jury awarded Applied Medical $44 million in damages and returned a finding that the earlier
infringement was willful, giving the district court discretion to enhance those damages to up to treble the damages awarded to Applied Medical by the jury. On October 1, 2004, the district
court issued post-trial rulings that denied U.S. Surgical's motion to set aside the jury's finding on willfulness and granted Applied Medical's motion for enhanced damages, enhancing the
jury's damages award by 25%, or $11 million. On January 27, 2005, the district court awarded Applied Medical $10 million in costs, prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. Thus,
Applied Medical's total award was $65 million. U.S. Surgical appealed the damages award and the


willfulness
finding to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On January 24, 2006, the Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the award to Applied Medical. On February 17,
2006, Tyco, on behalf of U.S. Surgical, paid Applied Medical $66 million which includes post-judgment interest accrued during the appeal. Tyco previously recorded a liability of
$66 million related to this matter.

On
July 31, 2003, Applied Medical filed another patent infringement suit against U.S. Surgical in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint alleges that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL Plus trocar product infringes Applied Medical's U.S. Patent No. 5,385,553. Applied Medical seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. Applied Medical filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the district court denied on December 23, 2003. On
February 7, 2005, the district court granted U.S. Surgical's motion for summary judgment. Applied Medical appealed the summary judgment ruling. On May 15, 2006, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision on the appeal vacating the district court's grant of summary judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings. The district court has
scheduled trial in this case for July 10, 2007.

Environmental Litigation

As previously disclosed, we have been in discussions with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
regarding historic environmental compliance issues at a facility sold by Tyco in 2000. In a letter dated February 10, 2006, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency proposed a penalty of $1,750,000 for alleged violations at this facility. The Company has discussed this matter in detail with the Environmental Protection Agency and
is seeking a negotiated resolution.

Commercial Litigation

Sensormatic v. Winner and Bagnara, Inc.

is a franchise dispute for which Sensormatic originally filed a complaint in 1999 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking declaratory relief. On June 28, 2004, the district court entered a stipulated judgment fixing the amount of the
defendant's past damages and commissions for royalties allegedly owed under the franchise agreement in the amount of $28 million, plus $5 million in pre-judgment interest,
and the entry of an injunction requiring Sensormatic to tender the franchise to the defendant. The judgment stayed the imposition and payment of these damages and injunctive relief until resolution of
an appeal of the district court's underlying rulings on liability to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On June 29, 2004, Sensormatic filed its Notice of Appeal to the
court of appeals. On August 31, 2005, the appellate court affirmed the district court judgment. A request for re-hearing before the entire Third Circuit was denied. No further
appeals have been taken and the judgment was satisfied on October 20, 2005. The Company does not expect to incur material losses beyond what has already been accrued and paid.

Asbestos Matters

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to
asbestos-containing materials. The majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds
of corporate defendants. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When
appropriate, the Company settles claims. However, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 29, 2006 there were
approximately 15,500 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and our subsidiaries.


Other Matters

Earth Tech v. City of Phoenix

is a contract dispute arising from Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix,
Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. On December 21, 2005, Earth Tech filed a lawsuit against the City of Phoenix in the Maricopa County
Superior Court alleging $3 million in damages plus interest for the City's failure to pay dewatering and computer systems costs related to the 91

st

Avenue project. After the City
rejected Earth Tech's administrative claim against the City, Earth Tech filed and served a First Amended Complaint upon the City of Phoenix. In its First Amended Complaint, Earth Tech alleged eighteen
causes of action and requested the following: (i) a recovery of at least $73 million for the value of the services performed by Earth Tech in connection with the contract; (ii) a
rescission of the contract; (iii) an equitable adjustment of the Contract price for additional dewatering services and the Computer Control System; and (iv) costs for demobilization and
termination of the contract. The City of Phoenix filed a Motion to Dismiss rather than filing an answer to the First Amended Complaint on May 18, 2006. The Court granted the City's Motion to
Dismiss without prejudice on September 19, 2006 allowing Earth Tech 30 days to file a Second Amended Complaint. Earth Tech filed its Second Amended Compliant against the City of
Phoenix on September 25, 2006.

On
December 29, 2005, the City of Phoenix filed a lawsuit against Earth Tech, Inc., its surety, Federal Insurance Company and other unnamed parties in the Maricopa County
Superior Court,

The City of Phoenix v. Earth Tech, Inc., Federal Insurance Company and John Does 1-50.

The lawsuit is in connection
with the City of Phoenix's termination on August 12, 2005 of Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment
Plant. The City alleges the following causes of action: (i) Earth Tech breached its Pre-Construction Services and Construction Management at Risk Contracts; (ii) Earth Tech
did not properly, reasonably or timely manage, supervise or inspect the work under the Contracts; (iii) Federal Insurance breached the terms and conditions of the performance bond; and
(iv) Federal Insurance failed to investigate the City's Bond Claims. The City requested unspecified general, consequential, incidental, special and liquidated damages plus interest as its
relief. On February 8, 2006, Earth Tech filed a Motion to Dismiss the City's Complaint in which Federal Insurance Company joined. The Court denied Earth Tech's Motion to Dismiss on
September 25, 2006. The City of Phoenix filed an Amended Complaint against Earth Tech and Federal Insurance on September 25, 2006. In the Amended Complaint, the City of Phoenix alleged
damages of $128 million.

The
Presiding Judge of Maricopa County Superior Court on July 11, 2006 consolidated all of the pending lawsuits related to this dispute on the Court's complex litigation docket.

The
transactions described in the table above represent the repurchase of common shares on the NYSE as part of the $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of
Directors in May 2006. The average price paid per share is calculated by dividing the total cash paid for the shares by the total number of shares repurchased. Approximately $659 million
remained outstanding under this share repurchase program at September 29, 2006. The Company, through an affiliate, also acquires shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax
withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. Approximately 31,000 shares were acquired in these vesting-related transactions outside of the share repurchase program
during the quarter ended September 29, 2006.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations including the effects of the restatement described in Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these
forward-looking statements due to many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Introduction

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its
subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States ("GAAP").

Restatement

Review of Prior Period Stock Option Grant Practices

Following publicity in 2006 regarding the granting of stock options at a number of companies, the Company initiated an internal review of its historical stock
option grant practices to determine whether the Company's stock option award actions were appropriately governed and were accurately reflected in the Company's financial statements. The Company's
Internal Audit staff, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, began a review of the Company's equity incentive plan practices and associated approvals over the period
October 1999 through June 2006. In addition to its review of plan administration, the Internal Audit staff performed detailed audit procedures on more than 95% of share options granted
through the regular and off-cycle grants during this period. The audit procedures covered 100% of named executive officers and Section 16 officers and directors. The Company's
review included an evaluation of grant authorizations, an assessment of the appropriate measurement dates under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,
"

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

," and the application of appropriate equity pricing methodology.

The
Company has determined that between October 1999 and 2002, there were several grants for which complete documentation was not available. As such, validation of the appropriate
measurement date under APB Opinion No. 25 was difficult to determine with precision. For such grants, the Company determined an appropriate measurement date in reliance upon all available
evidence and


consideration
of alternatives, including the communication date to grantees for all grants, to establish a reasonable date upon which equity recipients and share awards were known, fixed and ready to
be communicated to employees. To the extent the Company was able to conclude that grant date lists were fixed and ready to be communicated to employees, the measurement date was considered to be the
grant date. However, in many instances, the measurement date the Company used was the date that the equity award was communicated to the recipient.

The
Company has concluded that errors relating to the Company's stock option accounting primarily resulted from: (a) incomplete documentation to enable application of accounting
principles under APB Opinion No. 25; (b) the unintentional misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles; and (c) the absence of adequate control procedures in 1999
through early 2002 designed to ensure equity recipients and share awards were fixed and certain prior to the legal grant date.

The
amount of aggregate compensation expense related to this item, which the Company should have recorded in prior periods, is $252 million pre-tax and
$173 million after-tax, relating to grants awarded prior to the end of 2002. None of this amount relates to 2006, $17 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) relates to
2005 and $66 million pre-tax ($46 million after-tax) relates to 2004, as awards vested over the relevant vesting periods. Had the
Company used the communication date as the measurement date in all instances, the difference in the amount recorded would not have been material to any period or in the aggregate.

Review of Equity Plan Compliance

Separately, the Company identified an error related to the recognition of compensation expense under the Company's employee stock purchase program in the United
Kingdom. The aggregate compensation expense related to this item which the Company should have recorded in 2002-2005 is $29 million pre-tax and $20 million after-tax. None of
this amount relates to 2006, $7 million pre-tax ($5 million after-tax) relates to 2005 and $19 million pre-tax ($13 million after-tax) relates to
2004.

Effect of Restatement

Taken together, these prior period errors result in an aggregate understatement of compensation expense of $281 million pre-tax and
$193 million after-tax. Based on the findings of the items discussed above, the Company has restated its reported results for prior periods to reflect the impact of additional
stock-based compensation expense in Corporate. The impact by year is as follows ($ in millions):

Overview

As previously reported in our periodic filings, on January 13, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the
Company into three separate, publicly traded companies—Tyco Healthcare, one of the world's leading diversified healthcare companies; Tyco Electronics, the world's largest passive
electronic components manufacturer; and a combination of Tyco Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services, a global business with leading positions in residential and commercial security,
fire protection, and industrial products and services (the "Proposed Separation"). After thorough reviews of strategic options with our Board of Directors, we believe that this strategy is the best
way to position our market-leading companies for sustained growth and value creation.

Following
the Proposed Separation, Tyco's shareholders will own 100% of the equity in all three companies through tax-free stock dividends. Each company will have its own
independent Board of


Directors
and strong corporate governance standards. We expect to file Registration Statements in connection with the Proposed Separation during the second quarter of 2007.

In
connection with the Proposed Separation, the Company continues to estimate that the net economic cost to complete the transaction is expected to approximate $1.0 billion,
largely for tax restructuring, debt refinancing, professional services and employee-related costs. Depending on prevailing market conditions through the date of the Proposed Separation, the Company
anticipates that the corresponding income statement charges would be larger than net economic cost to complete the Proposed Separation. The difference between the income statement charges and the
estimated net economic cost is expected to result from costs to retire, refinance or reassign debt, as well as non-cash charges. During 2006, the Company incurred $169 million of costs related
to the Proposed Separation primarily related to legal, accounting and consulting work associated with executing the transaction.

Consummation
of the Proposed Separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of
counsel, the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the completion of any necessary debt refinancings. Approval by the Company's
shareholders is not required as a condition to the consummation of the Proposed Separation. Tyco has received an initial private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Proposed Separation noting it will qualify for favorable tax treatment.

We
are focused on growing profitability within each of these companies before and after the Proposed Separation, so that each may be well positioned for long-term growth as
independent entities. Following the Proposed Separation, we expect that all three companies will be dividend-paying companies. As we prepare for the Proposed Separation, we remain committed to
returning excess cash to shareholders. During 2006, we repurchased 95 million of our common shares for $2.5 billion under our share repurchase programs. We completed the
$1.5 billion share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors with the repurchase of 45 million of our common shares for $1.2 billion and we repurchased an
additional 50 million of our common shares for $1.3 billion under the new $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. We have
$659 million remaining on the $2.0 billion share repurchase program which we expect to complete prior to the Proposed Separation.

During
2006, holders of Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA") Series A 2.75% convertible senior
debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option converted $1.2 billion of these debentures into 54 million Tyco common shares and redeemed the remaining $1 million principal amount
outstanding with cash. Additionally, we utilized $1.0 billion in cash for a scheduled repayment of public notes and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities for a total cash payment of
$203 million, reducing principal debt and minority interest by $191 million and $10 million, respectively. In October 2006, we exercised our right to buy five cable laying
sea vessels that were previously included under an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement for $280 million.

During
2006, we completed the sale of our Plastics and Adhesives segment. Our Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses were sold for net proceeds of $882 million
and the A&E Products Group was sold for net proceeds of $2 million. During 2006, the Company also recorded a $30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and
Ludlow Coated Products businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal year 2006, as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement. This amount is payable to Tyco no later than
January 2007. Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Printed Circuit Group ("PCG"), a Tyco Electronics business and leading manufacturer of high-technology printed
circuit boards for the military, aerospace and commercial markets, for $226 million. This transaction was completed on October 27, 2006 and a gain on sale of approximately
$45 million is expected. As such, the operations of our Plastics and Adhesives


segment
and PCG business are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Details related to the Company's divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed
in "Discontinued Operations and Divestitures." We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with
our long term vision.

To
further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we have launched a restructuring program across all segments including the corporate organization which will
streamline some of the businesses and reduce our operational footprint. We expect to incur charges of approximately $600 million over the next two years, of which $500 million is
expected to be incurred in
2007. We expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately $450 million, of which $250 million is expected in 2007. We believe this restructuring program
will strengthen our competitive position over the long term.

Net
revenue increased $1.7 billion, or 4.2%, for 2006 as compared to 2005, as a result of growth in all segments, led by Electronics and Engineered Products and Services. Foreign
currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted 2006 revenue growth by $326 million and $125 million, respectively.

Operating
income decreased $294 million, or 5.1%, for 2006 while operating margin decreased 1.3 percentage points to 13.4%. Operating income for 2006 was unfavorably
impacted by charges of $426 million, consisting of separation costs of $169 million; incremental stock option charges of $161 million as required under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "

Share-Based Payment

," charges of $63 million related to purchased in-process research
and development and net restructuring and impairment charges of $33 million, of which $6 million is included in cost of sales. Operating income for 2006 also included net gains and
impairments on divestitures of $44 million, $72 million of income related to a settlement with a former executive and


$48 million
of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers' compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates
negatively affected operating income by $52 million.

Net
revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 3.5%, for 2005 as compared to 2004, which resulted from growth in all segments. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected 2005 by
$873 million while the impact of divestitures and acquisitions negatively impacted the period by $689 million.

Operating
income increased $622 million, or 12.1%, for 2005 while operating margin increased 1.1 percentage point to 14.7%. Operating income for 2005 was favorably impacted
by the gain on the sale of the TGN business of $301 million. In addition, the year was unfavorably impacted by charges related to an adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit on a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment of $277 million, a charge related to an SEC enforcement action of $50 million and a charge relating to former
executives' employment of $70 million. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by $142 million.

Net
revenue for Electronics increased $950 million or 8.1% in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 7.7% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue reflects
broad-based volume growth across most customer end markets, especially premise wiring, industrial machinery and equipment, consumer electronics, communications equipment manufacturing and
communication service provider markets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $148 million.


Operating income and operating margin for 2006 decreased as compared to 2005 due primarily to increased material costs of $306 million, incremental stock option charges of
$40 million required under SFAS No. 123R and negative changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $23 million. Additionally, operating income for 2006 included net
restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $16 million, of which $6 million is reflected in cost of sales, as compared to net restructuring and other credits of
$10 million in 2005, discussed below. Operating income for 2006 also includes $3 million related to the Proposed Separation.

Net
revenue for Electronics increased $403 million or 3.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 6.4% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue was driven
primarily by sales to the automotive, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, power utilities, communications equipment manufacturing and communication service provider markets. In addition,
revenue increased substantially due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $291 million. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the
Electrical Contracting Services business of $353 million.

Operating
income and operating margin for 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives and favorable changes in foreign currency
exchange rates of $57 million. These increases were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased commodity costs. Additionally, operating income for 2005 included net restructuring
and other credits of $10 million, as compared to net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $20 million in 2004.

Net
revenue for Fire and Security increased $150 million or 1.3% in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 2.4% increase in product revenue. Revenue from product sales includes
sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to growth in Worldwide Fire Protection Contracting and Services primarily related to electrical and
mechanical contracting as well as growth in the North American and international markets in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services. These increases were offset by the impact of acquisitions and
divestitures of $117 million, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, and a decrease in sales of breathing and fire detection products within Safety
Products.

Operating
income decreased $26 million in 2006 over the prior year primarily as a result of lower margins, increased investments in selling and marketing and a decline in European
recurring monitoring revenues within Worldwide Electronic Security Services. Results for the current period included net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $11 million as
compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $28 million in 2005. Operating income for 2006 was favorably impacted by cost savings related to operational excellence
initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. In addition, 2006 operating income was unfavorably impacted by $2 million


related
to the Proposed Separation as well as incremental stock option charges of $35 million required under SFAS No. 123R.

Attrition
rates for customers in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services business decreased to 13.8% on a trailing twelve-month basis for 2006, as compared to 14.8% for 2005 and 15.1%
in 2004.

Net
revenue for Fire and Security remained relatively level during 2005 as compared to 2004 as the decrease in product revenue was offset by an increase in service revenue. Revenue from
product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $274 million
and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volume of breathing and intrusion products at Tyco Safety Products as well as growth in our European fire services business. These increases were offset by the
impact of divestitures of $315 million and decreased sales at our security business in Europe.

Operating
income increased $317 million in 2005 over the prior year. Results for the current period included net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of
$28 million as compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $264 million in 2004. Operating income for 2005 was also favorably impacted by foreign currency
exchange rates of $26 million as well as cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. These cost reductions were partially offset by
increased investment in sales and marketing.

Net
revenue for Healthcare increased $98 million or 1.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. This increase was largely driven by the International and Surgical divisions within Medical
Devices & Supplies as a result of strong growth across the majority of geographic regions in surgical sales including laparoscopy, ablation and vessel sealing, and to a lesser extent, sutures.
Also contributing to the revenue increase was volume growth in Bulk Pharmaceuticals (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Retail, with growth primarily driven by new product sales and distribution,
growth in Latin America, as well as favorable economic trends and strategic promotional efforts in key markets. These increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of voluntary product recalls
in Imaging and lower volume sales within Respiratory, in addition to the negative changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $93 million.

Operating
income and operating margin decreased $86 million and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, as compared to 2005. The increased volume in Medical Devices &
Supplies, discussed above, was more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing performance primarily in Respiratory and Imaging, as a result of lower volumes and higher expenses primarily associated
with voluntary product recalls, as well as weakness in Retail of $40 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income, although to a lesser extent, was additional investments in
research and development and selling expenses. Operating income was adversely impacted by a charge of $63 million related to purchased in-process research and development,
incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $37 million, $2 million of charges related to the Proposed Separation and a $31 million negative


impact
related to foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, operating income for 2006 included a gain on divestiture of $48 million, primarily relating to a sale of a business within
Medical Devices and Supplies.

Net
revenue for Healthcare increased $433 million or 4.8% in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses and, to a lesser extent,
favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $141 million. Growth in Healthcare's underlying businesses was principally driven by increased revenue within Medical Devices &
Supplies which was largely the result of increased sales volume in the International division, primarily in Europe, due to a sales force investment and sales growth in vessel sealing, laparoscopy, and
stapling. Increased sales at the Surgical division within Medical Devices & Supplies also strongly contributed, due to enhanced contracting with group purchasing organizations, increased
acceptance of Laparoscopic Gastric By-Pass procedures and increased adoption of LigaSure device. Pharmaceuticals also contributed to the increase in revenue, although to a lesser extent.
These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in Retail primarily due to a difficult competitive environment and customer consolidations.

The
decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to a $277 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, associated
with the adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a previously disclosed legal matter. (Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion.) This charge, combined with declines in the Retail division as a result of the competitive environment mentioned above as well as increased material and transportation costs, was
offset by substantial increases from other divisions, specifically the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as well as within Pharmaceutical. Increases in
these divisions were due to strong sales growth as mentioned above, combined with a favorable product mix. Also positively impacting the segment were reduced administrative expenses at the segment
level, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates of $41 million.

Engineered Products and Services

Net
revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $486 million or 7.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a
result of strong project volume in the Pacific Region and favorable market conditions in Asia and North America, as well as increased selling prices in Electrical & Metal Products due to higher
costs of copper. To a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets and increased price realization. The above increases
in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which has resulted in fewer but more
profitable projects, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $25 million.

Operating
income remained relatively level in 2006 as compared to 2005. Both the revenue growth at Flow Control and Fire & Building Products, as well as favorable copper spreads
in Electrical &


Metal
Products and higher margin projects at Infrastructure Services contributed positively to operating income in 2006. Offsetting this growth was a $100 million charge relating to the
Voluntary Replacement Program for certain sprinkler heads (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and incremental stock option charges of $17 million required under SFAS
No. 123R.

Net
revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $449 million or 7.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased selling
prices in Electrical & Metal Products due to higher costs of steel and other raw materials. In addition, Flow Control and, to a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced
growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $167 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above
increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which has resulted in fewer
but more profitable projects.

The
increases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to increased volume and demand within the industrial and commercial markets, along
with the impact of operational excellence initiatives, cost reductions from prior period restructuring programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $21 million. These
increases more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, 2005 operating income includes $4 million of net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges as compared
to the $62 million of net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges in 2004.

Corporate

Corporate net revenue was $29 million and $25 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, which related to the TGN business which was sold in the third
quarter of 2005. Corporate expense was $400 million, $255 million and $482 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Corporate expense for 2006 includes $162 million
related to the Proposed Separation and incremental stock option charges of $32 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Corporate expense also includes income related to a settlement with a
former executive of $72 million as well as $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers' compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims
experience. Operating income for 2005 and 2004 has been restated to reflect additional compensation expense of $24 million and $85 million, respectively, related to the review of prior
period stock option grant practices and equity plan compliance. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Corporate
expense for 2005 includes a $301 million gain on the sale of the TGN business and TGN operating losses of $54 million. In addition, corporate expenses for 2005
included a $50 million charge representing the fines and penalties that the Company paid to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a
$70 million charge for estimated legacy contingencies related to former executives' employment.

Corporate
expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $8 million and net
restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Expense also included $73 million of operating losses
related to the TGN.

Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was $134 million in 2006, as compared to $123 million and $91 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Interest
expense was $713 million in 2006, as compared to $815 million in 2005 and $956 million in 2004. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily driven
by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program as compared to 2005.


The
decrease in interest expense in 2005 over 2004 is primarily the result of lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program compared to
2004. The weighted-average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively.

Other Expense, Net

During 2006, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss relating to the write-down of certain investments to their net realizable value.

During
2005, other expense, net included a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior
debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for
$1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a $1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

Also
during 2005, other expense, net included income of $109 million related to a court-ordered restitution award. On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and
director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted
the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years
in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions.

The
restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and
$25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as a receivable. The Defendants have
filed a notice of appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the Defendants' success upon appeal of the larceny
convictions, which, if successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable. The Court ordered the restitution payment to
be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing. Tyco has initiated the process of collecting the restitution payment owed, subject to the pending appeal. During October 2006, the
Company received payment of $38 million relating to the restitution and expects to receive the remaining amount in the second quarter of 2007.

During
2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of
$341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its
outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the
retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 16.4%, 26.7% and 27.8% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was
primarily the result of additional releases of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, as a result of improved historical and projected profitability in certain jurisdictions, and a
$127 million favorable adjustment to correct prior year tax reserves on legacy tax matters. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is primarily the result of the release of
valuation allowances, benefits realized related to the TGN divestiture, as well as the court-ordered restitution award related to certain former executives for which there is no tax obligation


and,
to a lesser extent, increased profitability in operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in charges for which no tax benefit was available
such as the loss on retirement of debt, asset impairments and the estimated settlement of the SEC enforcement action.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,731 million and $1,871 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient
future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 109,

"Accounting for Income Taxes,"

which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more
likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the
complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has
reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the United
States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax
adjustments and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded.
While the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company anticipates that certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007.

The
IRS continues to audit the years 1997 to 2000. In 2004 the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns, resulting in a
reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. These adjustments did not have a material impact on the financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

During
2006, the Company has developed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined
that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and accordingly has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially
permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such
subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related
to investments in subsidiaries.


Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

Discontinued Operations

During 2006, the Company consummated the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses as well as the A&E Product business for
$975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics,
Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses. During 2006, the
Company also recorded a $30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal
year 2006, as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement. This amount is payable to Tyco no later than January 2007. Net cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business was
$2 million, which does not include working capital provisions which are expected to be settled prior to the end of calendar year 2006. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued
operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.

During
2006, the Company recorded a $261 million and $26 million pre-tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow
Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre-tax impairment charges to write the
businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or
expected to be included in the respective sale agreements.

During
2006, the Company approved a plan to divest the Printed Circuit Group ("PCG") business, a component of the Electronics segment, and also entered into a definitive sale agreement
to sell PCG for $226 million in cash. During 2006, the Company recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on sale from discontinued operations for PCG related to the divestiture of
the PCG Spain business as well as certain other costs to sell. The sale of PCG was completed in October 2006 and the Company expects to record a gain on the sale of approximately
$45 million. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The PCG business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued
operations in all periods presented.

In
2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divesture of its Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses, as well as the A&E Products business, a global manufacturer
of plastic film, specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. As a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business,
the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long-lived assets and determined that the book value of certain long-lived assets in the
A&E Products business was greater than their estimated fair value and consequently recorded a long-lived asset impairment of $40 million and goodwill impairment charge of
$162 million. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on probability-weighted expected future cash flow of the assets.

During
2005, the Company divested 8 businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Engineered Products and Services and the Plastics and Adhesives
business segment. The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell of $60 million
during 2005.

During
2004, the Company reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million to write the carrying value of such assets down to their fair value less cost to
sell.

For
the additional 8 businesses in 2005 and the divested businesses in 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or
expected to be included in the sales agreements.


(Gains) losses on divestitures

During 2004, the Company divested twenty-one and liquidated four non-core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security.
During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write-down to fair value
of certain held for sale businesses.

During
2005, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Tyco
received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $301 million gain which is reflected in (gains)
losses on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were
not met.

During
2005, the Company divested 10 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded
net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales, in connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these
businesses, as well as the write-down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses.

During
2006, the Company divested 6 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security and Healthcare. The Company recorded net gains on divestitures of
$46 million in connection with the divestiture of these businesses, less $2 million of divestiture charges related to the write-down to estimated fair value and costs to sell
certain other held for sale businesses.

For
the divested businesses during 2006, 2005 and 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included
in the sales agreements.

Acquisitions

During 2006, Tyco's Healthcare segment acquired over 90% ownership in Floreane Medical Implants, S.A. ("Floreane") for approximately $123 million in cash,
net of cash acquired of $3 million. Floreane is an innovator in the development of surgical support implants for parietal, urological and gynecological surgery. The remaining outstanding shares
would be acquired if they become available. The Company recorded a $3 million in-process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition.

During
2006, Tyco's Healthcare segment also acquired over 50% ownership of Airox S.A. ("Airox") for approximately $59 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million. Airox is
a leading European company in the home respiratory ventilation systems business. Tyco expects to acquire the remaining Airox shares in a mandatory tender offer. The initial share purchase and the
subsequent tender offer combined are expected to total approximately $108 million. The Company has also recorded an $11 million in-process research and development charge in
conjunction with the acquisition. The charge relates to the development of second generation technology which has not yet obtained regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in-process
research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use.

During
2006, Tyco's Healthcare segment also acquired Confluent Surgical, Inc. ("Confluent"). The total purchase price is expected to be $246 million. As of
September 29, 2006, the Company has paid approximately $200 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $12 million. The Company has also deposited approximately $34 million
of the total purchase price into an escrow account related to closing balance sheet adjustments and certain indemnifications to be resolved through fiscal 2008. The Company recorded a
$49 million in-process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition related to technology which Confluent is developing for numerous applications across


several
surgical disciplines which have not yet received regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in-process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or
to have any alternative future use.

Cash
paid for other acquisitions in 2006 totaled $31 million, net of $8 million cash acquired.

In
July 2005, Tyco's Healthcare segment acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at
approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on achieving certain milestones.

Cash
paid, net of cash acquired, for various other acquisitions totaled $16 million.

During
2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million.

These
acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tyco's consolidated results from the respective
acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47,

"Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143."

Accordingly, the Company has recognized asset retirement obligations of
$32 million and property, plant and equipment, net of $10 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006. In addition, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of
accounting change which resulted in a $14 million after-tax loss ($22 million pre-tax). Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on FIN No. 47.

During
2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30

th

to August 31

st

,
effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the
actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million
after-tax gain ($28 million pre-tax) cumulative effect of accounting change. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
on retirement plans.

Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment

Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52-53 week" year
ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. In addition, certain of the Company's subsidiaries had consistently closed their books up to one
month prior to the Company's fiscal period end. These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change was not
material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net
income for the transition period related to this change was $26 million and was reported within Shareholders' Equity during 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of


assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments
and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems

—Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets
in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the
depreciable lives of subscriber systems, as defined below, included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in
intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third-party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives
of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization.

With
respect to Tyco's depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate
pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco
concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight-line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen-year period continues to be appropriate given the
observed actual attrition data for these pools.

Tyco
purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer
contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships).

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of
economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated
method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the double-declining balance method based on a ten-year life for the first eight years of the estimated life
of the customer relationships converting to the straight-line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly
reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above.

Attrition
rates for customers in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services business were 13.8%, 14.8% and 15.1% on a trailing 12-month basis for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

—Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea
fiber-optic cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are
based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties
inherent in long-term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated
losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated.

Product
discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Loss Contingencies

—Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and
other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on


judgment,
the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company
records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Income Taxes

—In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These
estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences
between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international
pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in
the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a
change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to
the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the
reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties
existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more
frequently if a triggering event occurs. In performing this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future
cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is
involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated.


We
elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company follows the
guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142,

"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

First, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to
identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
goodwill is considered impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied
fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss
is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The
Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Disruptions
to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a
significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting
units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.

There
were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Goodwill impairments included in loss from discontinued operations in 2005 totaled
$162 million.

Long-Lived Assets

—Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable
intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of
long-lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates,
reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long-lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the
applicable assets. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long-lived
assets may be overstated or understated.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

—Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical
assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other
assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial
assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit
obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our
present value of pension obligations by approximately $225 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected
long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected
long-term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $20 million.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 29, 2006, and
September 30, 2005 and 2004, as restated, were as follows ($ in millions):

The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $1,069 million in 2006. The components of this change are set forth in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The change in working capital included an increase of $680 million in inventories and a $332 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities,
primarily related to decreased accrued legal and audit fees, partially offset by an increase in annual employee bonus compensation.

The
provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory decreased from $232 million during the year ended September 30, 2005 to $174 million for the current
period. This decrease was driven by improvements across all segments, particularly due to improved accounts receivable aging, an overall improved credit profile of the customer base, and better
collections. Consequently, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from $421 million at September 30, 2005 to $336 million at September 29, 2006.

During 2006, the Company completed the sale of our Plastics and Adhesives segment, previously announced in 2005. Our Plastics, Adhesives and
Ludlow Coated Products businesses were sold for net proceeds of $882 million and the A&E Products Group was sold for $2 million in net cash proceeds.

During
2006, we made additional cash outflows of approximately $450 million for the resolution of certain previously accrued legal matters, including a patent dispute in the
Healthcare segment, and a cash payment of $50 million to settle the previously disclosed SEC enforcement action. We will continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares.

During
2006, we repaid and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities for a total cash payment of $203 million, reducing principal debt and minority interest by
$191 million and $10 million, respectively. Also, we utilized $1.0 billion in cash and $700 million in credit facility borrowings for scheduled repayments of public notes.


During 2006, we paid $413 million related to acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, including a net $200 million and a net $123 million related to the
previously discussed acquisitions of Confluent and Floreane, respectively, within Tyco's Healthcare segment.

We
continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards.
Capital spending increased to $1.6 billion in 2006 from $1.4 billion in 2005. The level of capital expenditures in 2007 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2006 and is also expected
to exceed depreciation. In October 2006, the Company exercised its right to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously included under an off-balance sheet leasing
arrangement for $280 million. This cash paid will be included in capital expenditures for 2007.

Income
taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $862 million.

During
2006, we repurchased 95 million of our common shares for $2.5 billion, completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program previously approved by the Board
of Directors in July 2005 and continuing the new $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006.

During
2006, 2005 and 2004, Tyco paid $373 million, $328 million and $254 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 401,000, 364,000 and 302,000
customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.

During
2006, 2005 and 2004 we paid out $68 million, $171 million and $266 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. These amounts include
$7 million, $16 million and $43 million, respectively, reported in discontinued operations. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
regarding our restructuring activities. Subsequent to year end, we launched a $600 million company-wide restructuring program. We expect to incur approximately $500 million of charges in
2007, and we expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately $450 million, of which $250 million is expected in 2007.

During
2006, 2005 and 2004, we paid $101 million, $48 million and $107 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Of the total
cash paid, $82 million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively, was reported in discontinued operations. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld
from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and
other contingencies. At September 29, 2006 holdback liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $112 million, of which $23 million are included in accrued and other
current liabilities and $89 million are included in other liabilities. At September 29, 2006, $40 million of acquisition liabilities remained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets,
of which $14 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $26 million are included in other liabilities.

As
previously mentioned, in January 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies.
In connection with the Proposed Separation, we paid $96 million in separation costs during 2006. We expect that, during 2007, we will incur the remaining cash outflows related to the Proposed
Separation which will be largely attributable to tax restructuring, debt refinancing, professional services and employee-related costs.

In
October 2006, the Company completed the sale of its PCG business, which was part of the Electronics segment, for $226 million and expects to record a gain on the sale of
approximately $45 million.


Capitalization

Shareholders' equity was $35.4 billion or $17.78 per share, at September 29, 2006, compared to $32.5 billion or $16.14 per share, at
September 30, 2005. This increase was due primarily to net income of $3.7 billion, the exchange of convertible debt due 2018 of $1.2 billion, and favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates of $619 million. These increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common shares by a subsidiary of $2.5 billion as previously mentioned and dividends
declared of $807 million.

At
September 29, 2006, total debt decreased $2.3 billion to $10.2 billion, as compared to $12.5 billion at September 30, 2005. Total debt as a
percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders' equity) was 22% at September 29, 2006 and 28% at September 30, 2005. Our debt levels significantly decreased as compared
to September 30, 2005 primarily due to the redemption of $1.2 billion of our Series A 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option, and the scheduled
$1.0 billion repayment of our 6.375% public notes. Also, as mentioned, we repaid and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities reducing our principal debt by $203 million.

Our
cash balance decreased to $2.9 billion at September 29, 2006, as compared to $3.2 billion at September 30, 2005. The decrease in cash was primarily due to
the repurchase of shares under the
previously-announced programs, and the scheduled debt repayments referred to above, capital expenditures, and to a lesser extent, dividend payments. The majority of these decreases were partially
offset by cash flows from operations.

TIGSA
holds a $1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. TIGSA also holds a $1.5 billion 3-year revolving
bank credit facility which was amended during 2006 to extend the maturity date from December 22, 2006 to December 21, 2007. Additionally, TIGSA holds a $500 million
3-year unsecured letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. At September 29, 2006, letters of credit of $475 million have been issued under the
$500 million facility and $25 million remains available for issuance. Also, during 2006, TIGSA borrowed $700 million under its $1.5 billion 3-year revolving
bank credit facility, with the entire proceeds used to repay its 5.8% public notes due 2006 at their maturity on August 1, 2006. There were no amounts borrowed under the other credit facilities
at September 29, 2006.

The
Company's bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. The Company's outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary
debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to the Company's operations. The Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

As
previously discussed, in May 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Pursuant to the new program, we may repurchase Tyco
shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 trading plan in accordance with
applicable regulations. A Rule 10b5-1 trading plan permits the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when the Company would not normally be active in the trading market
due to insider trading laws, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non-public information. Under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, we would be
unable to repurchase shares above a pre-determined price per share. Additionally, the maximum number of shares that we may purchase each day would be governed by
Rule 10b-18.

On
December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments
were $806 million in 2006. Following the Proposed Separation, we expect that all three companies will be dividend-paying companies.


Also,
following the Proposed Separation, it is anticipated that all three companies will be capitalized to provide financial flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities.
They are expected to have
financial policies, balance sheet and credit metrics that are commensurate with solid investment grade ratings. Tyco will continue to follow financial policies that are consistent with its current
credit ratings until the planned transactions take place. The Company's existing debt is expected to be allocated among the three companies or refinanced. Any existing or potential liabilities that
cannot be associated with a particular entity will be allocated appropriately to each of the businesses, and a sharing agreement among the three companies will be established.

long-term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and are excluded
from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans
are expected to be approximately $151 million in 2007 and we expect to pay $26 million in 2007 related to postretirement benefit plans.

At September 29, 2006, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees in the amount of $1.3 billion.

At
September 29, 2006, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.5 billion due December 21, 2007, and $1.0 billion due December 16, 2009, of which
$1.8 billion was undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Company's operating subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft and
similar types of facilities, which total $624 million, of which $606 million was undrawn and available at September 29, 2006. These facilities expire at various


dates
through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations.

At
September 29, 2006, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by Electronics. This
represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and
the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome
of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined.

In
June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3-year unsecured letter of credit facility due June 15, 2007. The facility provides for the issuance of
letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit
issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSA's bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSA's
6% notes due 2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the bank's base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined.
Upon the occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this credit facility during 2004 enabled the
Company to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 29, 2006, letters of credit of $475 million have been issued under the
$500 million credit facility and $25 million remains available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this credit facility at September 29, 2006.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and
litigation against former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as
defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses
and liability, in some or all of these matters. While we may from time to time seek to engage plaintiff's counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate
liability in these matters may be,
and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of
these matters.

Investigations

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Subpoenas and Document
Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be
required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities


(which
in turn could negatively impact our business with non-governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is
not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

On
April 17, 2006, the Company reached a settlement that closes the SEC Enforcement Division's investigation of the Company regarding certain accounting practices and other
actions by former Tyco officers. On April 25, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in which the Company was ordered to pay $1 in
disgorgement and a fine of $50 million. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company satisfied the judgment which was accrued in 2005.

Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

The Company is party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. Tyco has assessed the status of
these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's intellectual property and antitrust
litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation.

Environmental Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's environmental matters, see Item 1. Business—Environmental Matters.

Asbestos Matters

Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Consistent with
the national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed
against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a
subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat-resistant industrial products incorporating
asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants.

Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these
claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial
court proceeding related to asbestos claims.

When
appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 29, 2006,
there were approximately 15,500 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.

The
Company estimates its pending asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Company's estimate of the
liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has
adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes
that the final outcome of all


known
and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes

Tyco and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities,
including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other
tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. While the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company anticipates that
certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007.

Compliance Matters

Tyco has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. During 2005, Tyco reported
to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has
retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would
continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and will continue to have
communications with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential
improper payments identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities.

At
this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent
of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters.

Other Matters

The Company is a party to a contract dispute arising from Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for the expansion of the City's

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. Both Earth Tech and the City of Phoenix have filed lawsuits in the local county superior court alleging the other party has breached the
contract. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution
of this matter. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's other legal matters, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the
outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Backlog

At September 29, 2006, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $14.2 billion, compared to a backlog of $13.5 billion at September 30,
2005. We expect that approximately 77% of our backlog at


September 29,
2006 will be filled during 2007. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 is as follows ($ in millions):



Fire and Security

$

7,000

$

6,732

Engineered Products and Services

4,167

4,007

Electronics

2,711

2,496

Healthcare



$

14,158

$

13,507

Within
Fire and Security, backlog increased primarily as a result of strong bookings in North America and Europe. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring
revenue-in-force, which represents twelve months' fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring
revenue-in-force at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was $3.65 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. Backlog within Engineered Products
and Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders at Flow Control. Within Electronics, backlog increased as a result of increased bookings in most key end markets. Backlog in Healthcare
represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the business, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare to be a significant indicator of
the level of future sales activity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sale of Accounts Receivable

Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received ownership and
security interests in those receivables. These transactions qualified as true sales. The sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold, and the discount from the face amount
was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million, or 3.1% of the weighted-average balance of the
receivables outstanding, during 2004.

During
2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to its corporate accounts
receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004, and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of
$117 million related to certain of the
Company's international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short-term financing mechanism. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Company's remaining international
accounts receivable programs was $75 million and $80 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2007 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental


contamination
at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to
estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business—Environmental Matters for a discussion of
these liabilities.

The
Company had an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in October 2006, a subsidiary of the Company
has the option to buy these vessels for approximately $280 million, or return the vessels to the lessor and, under a residual guarantee, pay any shortfall in sales proceeds to the lessor from a
third party in an amount not to exceed $235 million. As of September 29, 2006, the Company expected this obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on an estimate of the fair value of the vessels performed by management with the assistance of a third-party valuation. In October 2006, the Company exercised its
option to buy these vessels for $280 million. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In
2001, Engineered Products and Services initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of
certain Model GB fire sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tyco's acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced over a
5-7 year period free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends
and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Company's obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company
recorded a $100 million charge which was reflected in cost of sales. Settlements during 2006 include cash expenditures of $37 million related to the VRP.


Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

—Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "

Share-Based Payment

," which requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions,
including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, as amended, "

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

." Tyco adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized for the unvested
portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2005 and all share-based payments granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 over the related vesting period. Prior to
October 1, 2005, the Company applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. Prior period results have not
been restated. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company's results from continuing operations for 2006 include incremental share-based compensation expense totaling $161 million.
As such, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were impacted by $0.06 and $0.05, respectively, in 2006.

On
November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3, "

Transition Election
Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

." The Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position for
calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123R in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to
establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact
on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R.
The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47,

"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 143,"

during the fourth quarter of 2006. This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset
retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when
an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Interpretation requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along
with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and
an
increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $22 million, pre-tax,
reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. Certain obligations relating
to the handling and disposal of asbestos have not been recorded due to the fact that fair value cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company does not have sufficient information about the range
of time over which the obligation may be settled. The undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized in the financial statements are approximately
$8 million. The Company will continue to monitor such legal asset retirement obligations and recognize a liability in the period sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate
the fair value.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143-1,

"Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste
Obligations,"

which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
("WEEE Directive"). Under the directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products


put
on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced, at which time the waste management obligation may be transferred to the
producer of the replacement equipment. FSP No. 143-1 is effective for the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive
into law by the applicable European Union member country. The financial statement impact depends heavily on the respective laws and regulations adopted by the EU member countries, their implementation
guidance and the type of recycling programs and systems that are established. The Company evaluated the effects of FSP No. 143-1 and determined that it did not have a material
impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

"Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R)."

SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability
on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized
as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a
measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 are
effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 158 on its consolidated financial
statements. Based on the funded status of defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of September 29, 2006, the Company estimates that it would recognize a net $356 million
liability through a reduction in shareholders' equity. The ultimate amounts recorded are highly dependent on various estimates and assumptions including, among other things, the discount rate
selected, future compensation levels and performance of plan assets. Changes in these assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated impact of implementing SFAS No. 158.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

"Fair Value Measurements,"

which enhances existing guidance for measuring
assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
is effective for Tyco beginning September 29, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial
position or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statement.

" SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual-approach" to assessing the quantitative effects of
financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is applicable for Tyco's fiscal year ending
September 28, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 108, but does not expect that it will have a significant impact on its financial position or
results of operations.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109."

This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN
No. 48 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our
more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material
changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2007. In assessing the current and future risk related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in
several tranches. The aggregate notional value of the interest rate and cross currency swaps terminated during the fourth quarter of 2006 was $2.5 billion. In October 2006, we terminated
the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $55 million. Since the interest rate swaps were
designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related
debt instruments.

In
December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Proposed Separation, the Company determined that it will no longer consider certain
intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long-term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments will be recorded in the
income statement rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders' equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments will continue to be
used to manage this exposure but will no longer be designated as net investment hedges.


We
utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross-border transactions and anticipated
non-functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial
instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate
swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows of principal repayment and weighted-average interest rates. For interest rate and cross-currency swaps, the table presents notional amounts
at the current market price rate and weighted average interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. The amounts included in the

All
other financial statements and schedules have been omitted since the information required to be submitted has been included in the consolidated financial statements and related notes
or because they are either not applicable or not required under the rules of Regulation S-X.

Information
on quarterly results of operations is set forth in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

The information required by Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) has previously been reported by the Company. There have been no disagreements with our
accountants, as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(b).


Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of September 29, 2006, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

To
ensure that our internal control over financial reporting continues to operate effectively and efficiently, we proactively identify opportunities for control improvements. During the
fourth quarter of 2006, the Company initiated an internal review of its historical stock option grant practices to determine whether the Company's stock option award actions were appropriately
governed and were accurately reflected in the Company's financial statements. The review was conducted by our Internal Audit staff under the direct supervision of our Audit Committee. The results of
the Internal Audit review were subject to the same controls and quality reviews associated with their normal recurring
activities and were reviewed regularly with the Audit Committee. The review identified controls that were not properly designed in prior years and, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, resulted in a restatement of our 2000 through 2005 Consolidated Financial Statements. While the Company had instituted a number of control improvements in recent years, including
the implementation of a grant nomination tool, other procedural enhancements and periodic audit reviews by Internal Audit, we consider the previously discussed special review performed by Internal
Audit to be a further enhancement to our equity-based compensation controls.

We
also have ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade various financial operating systems and eliminate many of the manual and redundant tasks previously performed under older
systems or processes. These changes will be implemented in stages over the next several years. We continued to enhance the internal controls relating to income tax accounting including further
strengthening the coordination between the tax and controllership functions, incorporating enhanced monitoring controls and implementing additional process level controls. Additionally, in preparation
of our previously announced separation into three separate public companies, we have begun the process of designing the necessary controls to allow the two new entities to properly function as
independent public companies. As we execute the steps necessary to effectuate the separation, we will begin migrating certain processes, applications and functions previously performed by us to these
two entities. We believe that these initiatives further strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, as well as automate a number of our processes and activities. We believe that the
necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as these initiatives continue.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of


records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of the Company's management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Management's
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2006.

Our
management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as stated in their report which is
included herein.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discussion of Management's Responsibility

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in this report.
We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to being recognized as a leader in governance, controls, clarity and transparency of financial statements. We are committed to making
honesty, integrity and transparency the hallmarks of how we run Tyco. We believe that to succeed in today's environment requires more than just compliance with laws and regulations—it
requires a culture based upon the highest levels of integrity and ethical values. Expected behavior starts with our Board of Directors and our senior team leading by example and includes every one of
Tyco's 238,200 global employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and business partners. One of our most crucial objectives is continuing to restore public, employee and shareholder confidence in
Tyco. We believe this is being accomplished; first, by issuing financial information and related disclosures that are accurate, complete and transparent so investors are well informed; second, by
supporting a leadership culture based on an ethic of uncompromising integrity and accountability; and third, by recruiting, training and retaining high-performance individuals who have the
highest ethical standards. We take full responsibility for meeting this objective. We maintain appropriate accounting standards, and disclosure controls and devote our full commitment and the
necessary resources to these items.

Dedication to Governance, Controls and Financial Reporting

Throughout 2006, we continued to maintain and enhance internal controls over financial reporting, disclosures and corporate governance practices. We believe that
a strong control environment is a dynamic process. Therefore, we intend to continue to devote the necessary resources to maintain and improve our internal controls and corporate governance.

Our
Audit Committee meets regularly and separately with management, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors, and our internal auditors to discuss financial reports,
controls and auditing.

We,
our Board and our Audit Committee are all committed to excellence in governance, financial reporting and controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 29, 2006 and September 30,
2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2006. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004, listed in the Index at Item 15a. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2006 and
September 30, 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R,

Share—Based Payment

, on
October 1, 2005 and Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

, during the fourth quarter of
2006.

As
discussed in Notes 9 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2005, the Company changed the measurement date of its pension and post retirement plans from
September 30 to August 31.

As
discussed in Note 1, the accompanying 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements have been restated.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of September 29, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company's internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Tyco International Ltd. and
subsidiaries (the "Company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2006, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.


We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended September 29, 2006 of the Company and our report dated December 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule and included explanatory paragraphs regarding the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share—Based
Payment,

on October 1, 2005 and Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,

during the fourth quarter of 2006.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation, Restatement and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

—The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco
International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Tyco") and have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated Financial Statements to 2006, 2005
and 2004 are to Tyco's fiscal year ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004, respectively.

Restatement

—

Reviews of Prior Period Stock Option Grant Practices and Equity Plan
Compliance

Review of Prior Period Stock Option Grant Practices

Following publicity in 2006 regarding the granting of stock options at a number of companies, the Company initiated an internal review of its historical stock
option grant practices to determine whether the Company's stock option award actions were appropriately governed and were accurately reflected in the Company's financial statements. The Company's
Internal Audit staff, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, began a review of the Company's equity incentive plan practices and associated approvals over the period
October 1999 through June 2006. In addition to its
review of plan administration, the Internal Audit staff performed detailed audit procedures on more than 95% of share options granted through the regular and off-cycle grants during this
period. The audit procedures covered 100% of named executive officers and Section 16 officers and directors. The Company's review included an evaluation of grant authorizations, an assessment
of the appropriate measurement dates under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

," and
the application of appropriate equity pricing methodology.

The
Company has determined that between October 1999 and 2002, there were several grants for which complete documentation was not available. As such, validation of the appropriate
measurement date under APB Opinion No. 25 was difficult to determine with precision. For such grants, the Company determined an appropriate measurement date in reliance upon all available
evidence and consideration of alternatives, including the communication date to grantees for all grants, to establish a reasonable date upon which equity recipients and share awards were known, fixed
and ready to be communicated to employees. To the extent the Company was able to conclude that grant date lists were fixed and ready to be communicated to employees, the measurement date was
considered to be the grant date. However, in many instances, the measurement date the Company used was the date that the equity award was communicated to the recipient.

The
Company has concluded that errors relating to the Company's stock option accounting primarily resulted from: (a) incomplete documentation to enable application of accounting
principles under APB Opinion No. 25; (b) the unintentional misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles; and (c) the absence of adequate control procedures in 1999
through early 2002 designed to ensure equity recipients and share awards were fixed and certain prior to the legal grant date.

The
amount of aggregate compensation expense related to this item, which the Company should have recorded in prior periods, is $252 million pre-tax and
$173 million after-tax, relating to grants awarded prior to the end of 2002. None of this amount relates to 2006, $17 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) relates to
2005 and $66 million pre-tax ($46 million after-tax) relates to 2004, as awards vested over the relevant vesting periods. Had the Company used the communication date as the
measurement date in all instances, the difference in the amount recorded would not have been material to any period or in the aggregate.


Review of Equity Plan Compliance

Separately, the Company identified an error related to the recognition of compensation expense under the Company's employee stock purchase program in the United
Kingdom. The aggregate compensation expense related to this item which the Company should have recorded in 2002-2005 is $29 million pre-tax and $20 million after-tax. None of
this amount relates to 2006, $7 million pre-tax ($5 million after-tax) relates to 2005 and $19 million pre-tax ($13 million after-tax) relates to
2004.

Effect of Restatement

Taken
together, these prior period errors result in an aggregate understatement of compensation expense of $281 million pre-tax and $193 million
after-tax. Based on the findings of the items discussed above, the Company has restated its reported results for prior periods to reflect the impact of additional stock-based compensation
expense in Corporate. See Note 23.

The
impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2005, as a
result of the above restatement, is summarized in the tables below. There was no impact on total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. The amounts previously reported are derived from the


Form 10-K
for the year ended September 30, 2005 filed on December 9, 2005 and have been reclassified for the effects of discontinued operations.

The

and $121 million, respectively.

Principles of Consolidation

—Tyco is a holding company which conducts its business through its operating
subsidiaries. The Company is a global, diversified company that provides products and services in four business segments: Electronics, Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and
Services (see Note 23). The Company consolidates companies in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or has the ability to control through similar rights. Also,
the Company consolidates variable interest entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities' expected losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected
returns. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of


during
the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

During
2006, Tyco completed the sale of the Plastics and Adhesives segment and entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Printed Circuit Group ("PCG") business, a business of the
Electronics segment. As the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria were met, the operations of the
Plastics and Adhesives segment and PCG are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant
estimates in these Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges and credits, acquisition liabilities, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash
flows associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, fair values of financial instruments, estimated
contract revenue and related costs, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and tax valuation allowances, and pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could
differ materially from these estimates.

Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment

—Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from
a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. In addition,
certain of the Company's subsidiaries had consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Company's fiscal period end. These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the
reported results of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income for the transition period related to this change was
$26 million and was reported within Shareholders' Equity during 2005. References to 2006, 2005 and 2004 are to Tyco's fiscal year ending in September unless otherwise indicated.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company recognizes revenue principally on four types of transactions—sales of products,
sales of security systems, subscriber billings for monitoring services and contract sales.

Revenue
from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass. This is generally when the products reach the
free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Provisions
for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in determining sales in the same
period the related sales are recorded. These provisions are based on terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical
experience and trend analysis.

Sales
of security monitoring systems include multiple elements including equipment installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. Amounts assigned to each component are
based on that component's objectively determined fair value. If fair value cannot be objectively determined for a sale involving multiple elements, the Company recognizes the revenue from installation
of services, along with the associated direct incremental costs, over the contract life.


Revenue
from the sale of services is recognized as services are rendered. Customer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are
rendered and the associated deferred revenue is included in current liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

Contract
sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea fiber optic cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded
primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to completion. Cost to
completion is generally measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing
profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable.

Certain
of the Company's long-term contracts have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based on the contract terms and technology
specific issues. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion
accounting.

At
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, accounts receivable and other long-term receivables included retainage provisions of $91 million in both
years of which $36 million and $31 million are unbilled, respectively. These retainage provisions consist primarily of electronics contracts, fire protection contracts as well as
transportation, water and environmental-related contracts and become due upon contract completion and acceptance. At September 29, 2006 the retainage provision included $58 million,
which is expected to be collected during 2007. In addition, at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, $56 million and $28 million, respectively, of accounts receivable
were unbilled related to long-term contracts.

Research and Development

—Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of product
sales. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred and building and overhead expenses. Customer-funded research and development are costs incurred by Tyco that are
reimbursed by customers. There is no net impact on research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income for customer-funded research and
development. Research and development expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income reflects company-sponsored research and development only. See Note 24.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. See
Note 24.

Translation of Foreign Currency

—For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that account in a functional currency
other than U.S. Dollars and do not operate in highly inflationary environments, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
within shareholders' equity. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are translated at the rate of
exchange in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments for the assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are included in net income.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions included in net income were $105 million, $52 million and $66 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

—All highly liquid investments purchased with maturity of three months or less from the time of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

On
occasion, the Company is required to post cash collateral to secure obligations in respect of various construction projects, contractual obligations related to acquisitions or
divestitures or other legal obligations. The amount of restricted cash in collateral was $77 million (of which $39 million is included in current assets and $38 million is
included in long-term assets) and $86 million (of which $44 million is included in current assets and $42 million is included in long-term assets) at
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses
inherent in Tyco's receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

—Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market
value.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

—Property, plant and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1,415 million, $1,431 million and $1,407 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when
incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Subscriber systems

10 to 14 years

Other machinery, equipment and

furniture and fixtures

2 to 20 years

The
Company generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer
accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. Subscriber systems represent internally generated residential systems and internally generated commercial systems (customer accounts acquired through
the ADT dealer program are recorded as intangible assets). The internally generated residential and commercial account pools are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a
ten-year period (a fourteen-year period is used for national commercial accounts and a fourteen-year period with write-off of specific accounts upon
discontinuance is used for residential and commercial accounts in certain non-U.S. locations).

Long-Lived Assets

—Tyco reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for
impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to
determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are
separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the
estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.


Goodwill and Intangible Assets

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more
frequently if a triggering event occurs. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash
flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. The Company performed its
annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2006 and no impairment occurred.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, first, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value
of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to
measure the amount of impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the
carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is
determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and
liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to
its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Amortizable Intangible Assets, Net

—Intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer relationships, and
intellectual property. Certain contracts and related customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate
under the ADT dealer program. Acquired contracts and related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price. The Company incurs costs associated with maintaining
and operating its ADT dealer program, including brand advertising and due diligence, which are expensed as incurred.

During
the first six months (twelve months in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from
customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a
reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset.

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program described above are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and
pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Based upon analyses of the period and pattern of economic benefit associated with the intangibles, which
utilize information contained in attrition studies of the ADT dealer program customer base, conducted by a third party appraiser, the Company believes that the accelerated method that presently best
achieves the matching objective above is the double-declining balance method based on a ten-year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationship,
converting to the straight-line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the
continued appropriateness of the accelerated method of amortization described above.


Other
contracts and related customer relationships, as well as intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology, are amortized on a
straight-line basis over five to forty years. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant
a revision to the remaining useful life.

Investments

—The Company invests in debt and equity securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity
securities that represent less than twenty percent ownership are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to other comprehensive
income within shareholders' equity for available for sale securities unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management
determines the proper classification of investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and
reevaluates such classifications as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other
equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that they are recorded at the
lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For equity investments in which the Company exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control, the equity method of
accounting is used. The
Company's share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and was not material in any period presented.

Product Warranty

—The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. Manufactured products are warranted
against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Generally, product warranties are implicit in the sale;
however, the customer may purchase an extended warranty. Manufactured equipment is also warranted in the same manner as product warranties. However, in most instances the warranty is either negotiated
in the contract or sold as a separate component. Warranty period terms range from 90 days (e.g., consumable products) up to 20 years (e.g., power system batteries). The warranty
liability is determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain instances
estimated property damage.

Environmental Costs

—Tyco is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Tyco provides for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company discounts environmental liabilities using a risk-free rate
of return when the obligation is fixed or reliably determinable. The impact of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at both September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was to
reduce the obligation by approximately $14 million.


TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Taxes

—Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities
and operating loss carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based
upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Insurable Liabilities

—The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities.
The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial
valuations based upon historical claims experience. Certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a risk-free rate of return when the obligation is reliably determinable. The impact
of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was to reduce the obligation by $47 million and $31 million, respectively. The Company
maintains captive insurance companies to manage certain of its insurable liabilities. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be
probable.

Financial Instruments

—The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward and option contracts to manage risks
generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk. Derivatives used for hedging purposes are designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception
of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract are highly correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the
life of the hedge contract.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet
items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are included in the cumulative
translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income to the extent they are effective. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
income and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. The ineffective portion of all hedges, if any, is recognized currently in
earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings.

Share Premium and Contributed Surplus

—In accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, when Tyco issues shares for cash at a
premium to their par value, the resulting premium is credited to a share premium account, a non-distributable reserve. When Tyco issues shares in exchange for shares of another company,
the excess of the fair value of the shares acquired over the par value of the shares issued by Tyco is credited, where applicable, to contributed surplus, which is, subject to certain conditions, a
distributable reserve.

Reclassifications

—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

—Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "

Share-Based Payment

," which requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee
stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, as


amended,
"

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,
"

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

." Tyco adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this
method, compensation cost is recognized for the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2005 and all share-based payments granted subsequent to September 30,
2005 over the related vesting period. Prior to October 1, 2005, the Company applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee
stock-based compensation. Prior period results have not been restated upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company's results from continuing
operations for 2006 include incremental share-based compensation expense totaling $161 million. As such, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were impacted by $0.06
and $0.05, respectively, in 2006.

On
November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3, "

Transition Election
Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

." The Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the
FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123R in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The alternative transition method includes
simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine
the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47,

"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 143,"

during the fourth quarter of 2006. This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset
retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when
an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Interpretation requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along
with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and
an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $22 million, pre-tax,
reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. Certain obligations relating
to the handling and disposal of asbestos have not been recorded due to the fact that fair value cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company does not have sufficient information about the range
of time over which the obligation may be settled. The undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized in the financial statements are approximately
$8 million. The Company will continue to monitor such legal asset retirement obligations and recognize a liability in the period sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate
the fair value.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143-1,

"Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste
Obligations,"

which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
("WEEE Directive"). Under the directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user
until the


equipment
is replaced, at which time the waste management obligation may be transferred to the producer of the replacement equipment. FSP No. 143-1 is effective for the first
reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive into law by the applicable European Union member country. The financial statement impact depends
heavily on the respective laws and regulations adopted by the EU member countries, their implementation guidance and the type of recycling programs and systems that are established. The Company
evaluated the effects of FSP No. 143-1 and determined that it did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

"Employers' Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106
and 132(R)."

SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or
liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not
recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company
presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 158 are effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 158 on its
consolidated financial statements. Based on the funded status of defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of September 29, 2006, the Company estimates that it would recognize a net
$356 million liability through a reduction in shareholders' equity. The ultimate amounts recorded are highly dependent on various estimates and assumptions including, among other things, the
discount rate selected, future compensation levels and performance of plan assets. Changes in these assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated impact of implementing SFAS No. 158.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

"Fair Value Measurements,"

which enhances existing guidance for measuring
assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
is effective for Tyco beginning September 29, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial
position or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.

" SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual-approach" to assessing the quantitative effects of
financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is applicable for Tyco's fiscal year ending
September 28, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 108, but does not expect that it will have a significant impact on its financial position or
results of operations.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109."

This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN
No. 48 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.


2.    Separation Transaction

On January 13, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded
companies—Tyco Healthcare, Tyco Electronics and a combination of Tyco Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services (the "Proposed Separation"). The Company intends to accomplish
the Proposed Separation through tax-free stock dividends to Tyco shareholders. Following the Proposed Separation, Tyco's shareholders will own 100% of the equity in all three companies.
Tyco expects to file Registration Statements in connection with the Proposed Separation during the second quarter of 2007.

In
connection with the Proposed Separation, the Company expects to incur cost related primarily to tax restructuring, debt refinancing, professional services and employee-related costs.
During 2006, the Company incurred $169 million of costs related to the Proposed Separation primarily related to legal, accounting and consulting work associated with executing the transaction.

Consummation
of the Proposed Separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of
counsel, the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the completion of any necessary debt refinancings. Approval by the Company's
shareholders is not required as a condition to the consummation of the Proposed Separation. Tyco has received an initial private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Proposed Separation noting it will qualify for favorable tax treatment.

3.    Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

Discontinued Operations

During 2006, the Company consummated the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses as well as the A&E Products business for
$975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics,
Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses. During 2006, the Company also recorded a $30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products
businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal year 2006, as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement. This amount is payable to Tyco no later than January 2007. Net
cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business was $2 million,
which does not include working capital provisions which are expected to be settled prior to the end of calendar year 2006. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria
and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.

During
2006, the Company recorded a $261 million and $26 million pre-tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow
Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre-tax impairment charges to write the
businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or
expected to be included in the respective sale agreements.

During
2006, the Company approved a plan to divest the Printed Circuit Group ("PCG") business, a component of the Electronics segment, and also entered into a definitive sale agreement
to sell PCG for $226 million in cash. During 2006, the Company recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on sale from discontinued operations for PCG related to the divestiture of
the PCG Spain business as well as certain other costs to sell. The sale of PCG was completed in October 2006. See Note 28—

Subsequent
Events

. The PCG business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented.


In
2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divesture of its Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses, as well as the A&E Products business, a global manufacturer
of plastic film, specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. As a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business,
the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long-lived assets and determined that the book value of certain long-lived assets in the
A&E Products business was greater than their estimated fair value and consequently recorded a long-lived asset impairment of $40 million and goodwill impairment charge of
$162 million. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on probability-weighted expected future cash flow of the assets.

During
2005, the Company divested 8 businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Engineered Products and Services and the Plastics and Adhesives
business segment. The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell of $60 million
during 2005.

During
2004, the Company reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million to write the carrying value of such assets down to their fair value less cost to
sell.

For
the additional 8 businesses in 2005 and the divested businesses in 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or
expected to be included in the sales agreements.

(Gains) losses on divestitures

During 2004, the Company divested twenty-one and liquidated four non-core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security.
During 2004, the Company recorded
net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write-down to fair value of certain held for sale
businesses.

During
2005, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Tyco
received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $301 million gain which is reflected in (gains)
losses on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were
not met.

During
2005, the Company divested 10 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded
net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales,


in
connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these businesses, as well as the write-down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses.

During
2006, the Company divested 6 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security and Healthcare. The Company recorded net gains on divestitures of
$46 million in connection with the divestiture of these businesses, less $2 million of divestiture charges related to the write-down to estimated fair value and costs to sell
certain other held for sale businesses.

For
the divested businesses during 2006, 2005 and 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included
in the sales agreements.

2006 Charges and Credits

During 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $26 million, including $6 million reflected in cost of sales for the
non-cash write down in carrying value of inventory. Restructuring


charges
during 2006 were $39 million, which includes $27 million of severance and $12 million of facility exit costs and other charges. These charges related to several
restructuring actions and facility exit plans which were initiated in 2006 for $30 million as well as costs incurred in 2006 related to actions initiated prior to 2006 for $9 million.
During 2006, the Company completed restructuring activities announced in prior years for amounts less than originally estimated, and accordingly reversed $15 million of restructuring reserves.
The Company also recorded other non-cash credits of $4 million related to the Electronics segment. Most of the restructuring initiatives undertaken during 2006 as well as actions
taken in prior periods, which impact restructuring charges incurred during 2006, relate to the Electronics and Fire and Security segments.

During
2006, the Company paid $21 million related to these actions and has $9 million accrued as of September 29, 2006.

2005 Charges and Credits

During 2005, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $6 million, including $1 million reflected in cost of sales for the non-cash
write down in carrying value of inventory. Restructuring charges during 2005 were $48 million, which includes $22 million of employee severance and benefits, $15 million of
facility exit costs and $11 million of other costs. These charges related to several restructuring actions and facility exit plans which were initiated in 2005 as well as incremental costs
incurred in 2005 related to actions initiated during 2004. Of these charges, $22 million related to actions initiated and completed in 2005 while the remaining $27 million related to
actions which commenced prior to 2005. During 2005, the Company completed restructuring activities announced in prior years for amounts less than originally estimated, and accordingly reversed
$23 million of restructuring reserves as a restructuring credit. In addition, the Company also sold assets which were previously written down to their net realizable value in prior years for
amounts greater than originally estimated and recorded related gains as restructuring credits of $20 million. The restructuring credits were mainly incurred by Electronics.

The
$22 million of charges for 2005 restructuring initiatives were largely a result of actions taken by Electronics and Fire and Security segments which incurred severance of
$9 million and $6 million, respectively. Through 2006, the Company has substantially paid these obligations and the Company has $1 million accrued as of September 29, 2006.
In addition, during 2005, the Company transferred $4 million of severance liabilities from liabilities held for sale, which resulted from the sale of TGN, that has also been substantially paid
at September 29, 2006.

2004, the Company approved and announced to employees various plans to exit 181 facilities primarily in the United States. These plans included the termination of
approximately 8,616 employees resulting in restructuring charges totaling $284 million, including $6 million reflected in cost of sales for the non-cash
write-down in carrying value of inventory, $196 million for employee severance and benefits, $60 million for facility exit costs and $22 million for other related
cost. Through September 29, 2006, a total of $176 million, $43 million and $27 million related to employee severance and benefits, facilities exit costs and other,
respectively, had been expended related to these plans. Through September 29, 2006, the Company completed certain activities related to these plans for amounts less than originally estimated,
and accordingly the Company reversed $25 million of restructuring reserves as a restructuring credit.

2004, the Company also sold certain cable-laying sea vessels and other assets that were written down to their expected net realizable value in prior years for amounts greater than
originally estimated and recorded related gains as restructuring credits of $40 million. During 2004, the Company also completed certain restructuring activities announced in prior years for
amounts less than originally estimated, and accordingly the Company reversed $34 million of restructuring reserves as a restructuring credit.

5.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

During 2006 and 2005, there were no significant charges in continuing operations related to the impairment of long-lived assets.

During
2004, the Company recorded total charges in continuing operations for the impairment of long-lived assets of $52 million. Fire and Security recorded charges of

6.    Acquisitions

Acquisitions

During 2006, Tyco's Healthcare segment acquired over 90% ownership in Floreane Medical Implants, S.A. ("Floreane") for approximately $123 million in cash,
net of cash acquired of $3 million. Floreane is an innovator in the development of surgical support implants for parietal, urological and gynecological surgery. The remaining outstanding shares
would be acquired if they become available. The Company recorded a $3 million in-process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition.

During
2006, Tyco's Healthcare segment also acquired over 50% ownership of Airox S.A. ("Airox") for approximately $59 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million. Airox is
a leading European company in the home respiratory ventilation systems business. Tyco expects to acquire the remaining Airox shares in a mandatory tender offer. The initial share purchase and the
subsequent tender offer combined are expected to total approximately $108 million. The Company has also recorded an $11 million in-process research and development charge in
conjunction with the acquisition. The charge relates to the development of second generation technology which has not yet obtained regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in-process
research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use.

During
2006, Tyco's Healthcare segment also acquired Confluent Surgical, Inc. ("Confluent"). The total purchase price is expected to be $246 million. As of
September 29, 2006, the Company has paid approximately $200 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $12 million. The Company has also deposited approximately $34 million
of the total purchase price into an escrow account related to closing balance sheet adjustments and certain indemnifications to be resolved through fiscal 2008. The Company recorded a
$49 million in-process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition related to technology which Confluent is developing for numerous applications across
several surgical disciplines which have not yet received regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in-process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or
to have any alternative future use.

Cash
paid for other acquisitions in 2006 totaled $31 million, net of $8 million cash acquired.

In
July 2005, Tyco's Healthcare segment acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at
approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on achieving certain milestones.


Cash
paid, net of cash acquired, for various other acquisitions totaled $16 million.

During
2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million.

These
acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tyco's consolidated results from the respective
acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Acquisition Liabilities

At September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, acquisition liabilities were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in
millions):



Accrued and other current liabilities

$


$


Other liabilities



$


$


Acquisition
liabilities were established in connection with acquisitions in 2002 and prior and relate primarily to long-term non-cancelable lease obligations. The
Company paid $17 million, $30 million and $54 million to fund acquisition liabilities during 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Of the total cash paid, $1 million and $2 million was reported in discontinued operations in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Holdback Liabilities

The Company paid cash of approximately $84 million, $18 million and $53 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, relating to
holdback liabilities related to certain prior period acquisitions. Of the total cash paid, $82 million, $0 and $1 million, respectively, was reported in discontinued operations. Holdback
liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. Certain acquisitions have provisions that
would require Tyco to make additional payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These payments are tied to certain performance
measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth and are generally treated as additional purchase price.

At
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, holdback liabilities were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions):

ADT Dealer Program

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, Tyco paid $373 million, $328 million and $254 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 401,000,
364,000 and 302,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.

7.    Other Expense, Net

During 2006, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss relating to the write-down of certain investments to their net realizable value.

During
2005, other expense, net included a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior
debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a
$1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

Also
during 2005, other expense, net included income of $109 million related to a court-ordered restitution award. On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and
director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted
the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years
in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions.

The
restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and
$25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Company's
consolidated financial statements as a receivable. The Defendants have filed a notice of appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the
likelihood of the Defendants' success upon appeal of the larceny convictions, which, if successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution
award is probable. The Court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing. Tyco has initiated the process of collecting the restitution payment
owed, subject to the pending appeal. See Note 28—

Subsequent Events

.

During
2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of
$341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its
outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the
retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

Included in non-deductible charges for 2006 is a $127 million favorable adjustment related to a correction to 2005 tax reserves
on legacy tax matters and a $31 million unfavorable adjustment associated with proposed corrections to prior period income tax returns. Included in loss on retirement of debt in 2006 is a
cumulative one-time benefit of $243 million associated with the receipt of a


favorable
tax ruling in the fourth quarter of 2006 permitting the deduction of debt retirement costs. This benefit is partially offset by an increased valuation allowance of $173 million
relating to the deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses created by the debt retirement deductions. This $173 million is reflected on the valuation allowance line in the table
above.

Deferred
income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net

At
September 29, 2006, the Company had $5,673 million of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Of these, $3,747 million
have no expiration, and the remaining $1,926 million will expire in future years through 2016. Due to a favorable tax ruling in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company was able to recognize
$1,157 million of net operating loss carryforwards associated with deduction of debt retirement costs. In the U.S., there were approximately $5,133 million of federal and
$4,675 million of state net operating loss carryforwards at September 29, 2006, which will expire in future years through 2026.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,731 million and $1,871 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate
sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets
will not be realized. At September 29, 2006, approximately $153 million of the valuation allowance will ultimately reduce goodwill if the net operating losses are utilized.


The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. See "Income Taxes" in Note 18.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the
complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has
reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate
assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If
payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the
liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one
year.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially
permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by
such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences
related to investments in subsidiaries.

9.    Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During 2006, the Company adopted FIN No. 47. Accordingly, the Company has recognized asset retirement obligations of $32 million and property, plant
and equipment, net of $10 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006. In addition, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in a
$14 million after-tax loss ($22 million pre-tax). Refer to Note 1 for additional information on FIN No. 47.

During
2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30

th

to August 31

st

,
effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the
actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million
after-tax gain ($28 million pre-tax) cumulative effect of accounting change. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on retirement plans.

72 million and 67 million shares, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.

The
computation of diluted earnings per share in 2006 and 2005 excludes restricted share awards of approximately 6 million and 2 million, respectively, because the effect
would be anti-dilutive.

11.    Sale of Accounts Receivable

Historically, Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received
ownership and security interests in those
receivables. These transactions qualified as true sales. The sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold, and the discount from the face amount was included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million, or 3.1% of the weighted-average balance of the receivables outstanding,
during 2004.

During
2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to its corporate accounts
receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004, and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of
$117 million related to certain of the Company's international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short-term financing mechanism. The aggregate amount outstanding
under the remaining international accounts receivable programs was $75 million and $80 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.


12.    Investments

At September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, Tyco had available-for-sale investments with a fair market value of
$318 million and $265 million and a cost basis of $323 million and $268 million, respectively. These investments consist primarily of debt securities and are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 29, 2006, $61 million of these debt securities were due to mature
within one year, with the remainder substantially due in one to five years. The unrealized gains and losses related to these investments are immaterial and have been included as a separate component
of shareholders' equity.

14.    Related Party Transactions

The Company has amounts due related to loans and advances issued to employees in prior years under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, relocation programs
and other advances made to executives. Loans were provided to employees under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, which is now discontinued except for outstanding loans for the payment of taxes
upon the vesting of shares granted under our Restricted Share Ownership Plans. The loans are not collateralized and bear interest, payable annually, at a rate based on the six-month LIBOR,
calculated annually as the average of the 12 rates in effect on the first day of the month. Loans are generally repayable in ten years; however, earlier payments are required under certain
circumstances, such as when an employee is terminated. In addition, the Company made mortgage loans to certain employees under employee relocation programs. These loans are generally payable in
15 years and are collateralized by the underlying property. During 2006 and 2005, the maximum amount outstanding under these programs was $69 million and $70 million,
respectively. Loans receivable under these programs, as well as other unsecured advances outstanding, were $52 million and $68 million at September 29, 2006 and
September 30, 2005. The total outstanding loans receivable includes loans to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Company's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (until June 2002). The amount
outstanding under these loans, plus accrued interest, was $52 million and $49 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, and the rate of interest
charged on such loans was 5.0% and 3.2% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income on these interest bearing loans totaled $2 million, $2 million, and $1 million in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Certain of the above loans totaling $30 million and $20 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, are


non-interest
bearing. The total non-interest bearing loans in 2005 include loans to Mark A. Belnick, the Company's former Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Counsel.
The amount outstanding under these loans at September 30, 2005 was $15 million and was repaid in 2006.

During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors and new senior management adopted a policy under which no new loans are allowed to be granted to any officers of the Company and
existing loans are not allowed to be extended or modified.

During
2006, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., VF Corporation and Rohm and Haas Company. Sandra S. Wijnberg, a Director, was an executive officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.
prior to her resignation from that company on March 31, 2006. Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive officer of VF Corporation. Rajiv L. Gupta, a Director, is an executive officer of
Rohm and Haas Company. Purchases from Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. during 2006 were approximately $16 million. Purchases from other companies noted above during 2006
aggregated less than 1 percent of consolidated net revenue.

During
2005, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Brunswick Corporation, VF Corporation and Rohm and Haas Company. Sandra S. Wijnberg, a Director during such period, was an executive officer of
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. George W. Buckley, a Director during such period, was an executive officer of Brunswick Corporation. Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive
officer of VF Corporation. Rajiv L. Gupta, a Director, is an executive officer of Rohm and Haas Company. Purchases from Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. during 2005 were approximately
$23 million. Purchases from other companies noted above during 2005 aggregated less than 1 percent of consolidated net revenue.

During
2004, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Brunswick Corporation and VF Corporation. Sandra S. Wijnberg, a Director during such period, was an executive officer of Marsh & McClennan
Companies, Inc. George W. Buckley, a Director during such period, was an executive officer of Brunswick Corporation. Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive officer of VF Corporation.
Purchases from Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. during 2004 were approximately $22 million. Purchases from other companies noted above during 2004 aggregated less than
1 percent of consolidated net revenue.

In
2001, Tyco authorized compensation arrangements to L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Director until August 2002. In connection
with such arrangements, Tyco purchased executive split dollar life insurance policies for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz and entered into a shared ownership agreement with each of them whereby
the Company agreed to pay premiums for these insurance policies for an 11-year period beginning in 2001. In 2001, amended policies were executed providing for additional
Company-paid premiums. The Company is a co-beneficiary of the policies, less amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz. Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz are the
beneficiaries of the cash surrender values of the policies plus the amount of any unpaid premiums. The Company's obligations under these arrangements were entered into in recognition of services
rendered by these officers and were not contingent upon continuing


employment.
At that time, the Company deposited $31 million into a rabbi trust to fund premiums on the policies. In the event the investment options within the policies do not earn specified
interest amounts, Tyco had guaranteed a supplemental premium payment amount to ensure a 10% annual return on the cash surrender value, and any unpaid premiums. This liability was accreted by a charge
to earnings throughout the period of the arrangements to make the specified supplemental premium payments, if any. In conjunction with Mr. Swartz's termination of employment, a lump sum payment
of $25 million, which represented the present value of the annual premium amounts at his termination date for the remainder of the contractual period, was made to Mr. Swartz and in
return Mr. Swartz waived Tyco's obligation to continue making premium payments. Tyco discontinued making premium payments for Mr. Kozlowski's insurance policy as of October 1,
2002. The Company filed affirmative actions against Mr. Kozlowski, seeking disgorgement of all benefits under this executive life insurance policy. Pending resolution of such action against
Mr. Kozlowski, premium obligations since October 2002 have been drawn down from the cash surrender value of such policy to avoid termination of such policy's death benefit. On
September 27, 2006, the Company and Mr. Kozlowski entered into a general release agreement that terminated Mr. Kozlowski's shared ownership agreement of the split dollar life
insurance policy and the rabbi trust. As such, the Company has no continuing obligation to make any payment or contributions with respect to the split dollar insurance policy or the rabbi trust. The
Company recorded a credit of $72 million related to this liability in 2006 within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Consolidated
Financial Statements include charges of $7 million, $7 million and $6 million for Mr. Kozlowski in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company had accrued
$65 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2005, in connection with this arrangement. As of September 29, 2006, $25 million remains in a rabbi trust.

The
Company filed civil complaints against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to alleged abuses of our Key Employee Loan
Program and relocation program, unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self-dealing transactions and other improper conduct.

In
June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related
wrongful conduct involving a $20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The
payment was purportedly made for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging our acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh pleaded guilty to a felony
violation of New York law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York County) and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the SEC in United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Both the felony charge and the civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such payment. The felony charge accused
Mr. Walsh of intentionally concealing information concerning the payment from Tyco's directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities in the State of New York. The SEC
action alleged that Mr. Walsh knew that the registration statement covering the sale of Tyco securities as part of the CIT Group acquisition contained a material misrepresentation concerning
fees payable in connection with the acquisition. Pursuant to the plea and settlement, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on December 17, 2002. Our claims against
Mr. Walsh are still pending.

Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), holds a
$1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. TIGSA also holds a $1.5 billion 3-year revolving bank credit facility which
was amended on June 28, 2006 to extend the maturity date from December 22, 2006 to December 21, 2007. Additionally, TIGSA holds a $500 million 3-year unsecured
letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. At September 29, 2006, letters of credit of $475 million have been issued under the $500 million facility and
$25 million remains available for issuance. At September 29, 2006, $700 million has been borrowed under the $1.5 billion 3-year revolving bank credit facility.
There were no amounts borrowed under the other credit facilities at September 29, 2006 and no amounts borrowed under any of these credit facilities at September 30, 2005.

During
2006, the Company utilized $1.0 billion in cash and the above mentioned $700 million in credit facility borrowings for scheduled repayments of its 6.375% and 5.8%
public notes due 2006, respectively.


On
January 26, 2006, the Company repaid and terminated one of its synthetic lease facilities used to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment for a
total cash payment of $203 million, reducing principal debt and minority interest by $191 million and $10 million, respectively.

On
February 21, 2006, TIGSA delivered a notice of redemption to the holders of its Series A 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option (the "2.75%
convertible senior debentures"), exercising its right to redeem all such debentures at 101.1 percent of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest. The 2.75% convertible senior
debentures were convertible into 43.892 Tyco common shares per $1,000 principal amount. Prior to March 8, 2006, the redemption date,
$1.2 billion of the 2.75% convertible senior debentures were converted into 54.4 million Tyco common shares and on March 8, 2006, TIGSA redeemed the remaining $1 million
principal amount outstanding with cash.

As
of September 29, 2006, TIGSA had $750 million outstanding of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option ("the 3.125% convertible senior
debentures"). These debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco and, at any time, holders may convert each $1,000 principal amount of the debentures into 45.9821 Tyco common shares
prior to the stated maturity at a rate of $21.7476 per share. Additionally, holders of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures may require TIGSA to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on
January 15, 2015. If the option is exercised, TIGSA must repurchase the debentures at par plus accrued interest, and may elect to repurchase the securities for cash, Tyco common shares, or some
combination thereof. TIGSA may redeem for cash some or all of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures at any time on or after January 20, 2008, for an amount equal to the redemption price.

The
Company's bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. At September 29, 2006, the Company had one remaining synthetic lease facility, with other covenants,
including interest coverage and leverage ratios (see Note 28—

Subsequent Events

). The Company's outstanding indentures contain
customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to the Company's operations. The
Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The
fair value of debt was approximately $10.9 billion (book value of $10.2 billion) and $13.5 billion (book value of $12.5 billion) at September 29,
2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, based on discounted cash flow analyses using current market interest rates.

The
aggregate amounts of total debt, including capital leases, maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): $808 in 2007, $847 in 2008 $2,577 in 2009,
$23 in 2010, $1,009 in 2011 and $4,909 thereafter.

The
weighted-average rate of interest on total debt was 5.9% and 5.6% for the years ended September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, excluding the impact of
interest rate swaps. The weighted-average rate of interest on all variable debt was 6.3% and 7.2% at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. The impact of the Company's
interest rate swap agreements on reported interest expense was a net increase of $10 million for 2006 and a net reduction of $40 million and $66 million for 2005 and 2004,
respectively.


16.    Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2007 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 18 for a discussion of these liabilities.

The
Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 29, 2006 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which
is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on its estimate of the fair value of the vessels (see Notes 18 and 28).

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Note 1.

In
2001, Engineered Products and Services initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of
certain Model GB fire sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tyco's acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced over a
5-7 year period free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends
and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Company's obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company
recorded a $100 million charge which


was
reflected in cost of sales. Settlements during 2006 include cash expenditures of $37 million related to the VRP.

17.    Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt and derivative
financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable and derivative financial instruments approximated book value at
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005. See Note 15 for the fair value estimates of debt.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and changes in a derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge criteria are met. Fair value estimates are based on relevant market information, including current market rates and prices, assuming adequate market liquidity. Fair value estimates for
interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by the Company or are provided to the Company by high-quality, third-party financial institutions known to be high volume participants
in this market.

The
Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company's objective for utilizing derivatives is to manage these
risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. For those transactions that are designated as hedges, the Company documents relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, and links derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions. For transactions designated as hedges, the Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates, the Company enters into various interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties. To ensure both appropriate use as a hedge and hedge accounting treatment, all derivatives entered into are designated according to a hedge objective against specified forecasted
interest payments on specifically underwritten debt issuances. The Company's primary hedge objectives include the conversion of fixed-rate liabilities to variable rates. The derivative
financial instruments associated with these objectives are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes forward and option contracts with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties. The objective of these hedging contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans, notes receivable and accounts
payable, and forecasted transactions. The Company has designated certain forward contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt issuances to hedge its net investments in foreign operations.
The remaining hedges are marked to market with changes in the derivatives' fair value recognized in the income statement.

The
Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as Tyco deals with a variety of
major banks worldwide with long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments are utilized,
thereby affording optimum clarity as to the market risk. None of the Company's derivative financial instruments outstanding at year end would


result
in a significant loss to the Company if a counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, the Company does not require collateral or other security to be
furnished by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments.

In
assessing the current and potential future risk attributable to interest rate movements, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company terminated interest rate swaps and cross
currency agreements with an aggregate notional value of $2.5 billion. The fair value of the swaps at the time of termination was a net gain of $10 million. As the interest rate swaps
were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the net deferred loss of $26 million will be recognized in earnings over the remaining term of the related debt instrument. The
remaining agreements were terminated subsequent to the end of 2006.

Interest Rate Exposures

The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Under these agreements, the Company receives a fixed rate of
interest of 6.4% and pays a floating rate of interest based on six month LIBOR. At September 29, 2006, the Company had interest rate swaps in a net loss position of $6 million designated
as fair value hedges with expiration dates in 2011. The mark-to-market effects of both the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying debt obligations were recorded in
interest expense and are directly offsetting to the extent the hedges are effective.

In
addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements ("cross currency swaps") to manage its exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency
exposure on loans denominated in foreign currency. Under these agreements, the Company receives a fixed rate of interest of 6.5% and pays floating rates of interest based on six month LIBOR. At
September 29, 2006, the Company had interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements in a net gain position of $52 million designated as a fair value hedge with an expiration date in
2011. The mark-to-market effects on the interest rate and foreign currency swaps were recorded in interest expense and selling, general and administrative expense,
respectively, and directly offset the corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items to the extent the hedges were effective. The ineffective portion of the hedge was not material.

Foreign Currency Exposures

The Company hedges its net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $7.1 billion at September 29,
2006. Included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income was a net loss of $91 million and a net gain of $31 million at September 29, 2006 and
September 30, 2005, respectively. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts qualifying as net investment hedges are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of
accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedges are effective. Amounts excluded from the measure of effectiveness of the net investment hedges totaled $6 million and were
recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The
Company uses forward agreements to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on raw material purchases. These forward agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains
and losses resulting from these hedges, the amounts of which are not material in any period presented, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive
income


to
earnings and recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales when the underlying transaction impacts earnings.

Tyco
uses various options, swaps, and forwards not designated as hedging instruments, to manage foreign currency exposures on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable,
intercompany loans and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. For derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company records changes in fair value through
earnings in the period of change. The fair value of these instruments totaled $23 million at September 29, 2006.

18.    Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has facility, vehicle and equipment leases that expire at various dates through the year 2052. Rental expense under these leases was
$717 million, $764 million, and $764 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company also has facility and equipment commitments under capital leases.

The Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services. At September 29, 2006, such
obligations were as follows: $222 million in 2007, $24 million in 2008, $10 million in 2009, $10 million in 2010, $7 million in 2011, and an aggregate of $24 million
in 2012 and thereafter.

At
September 29, 2006, the Company had an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in
October 2006, a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy these vessels for approximately $280 million, or return the vessels to the lessor and, under a residual guarantee, pay any
shortfall in sales proceeds to the lessor from a third party in an amount not to exceed $235 million. As of September 29, 2006, the Company expected this obligation to be
$54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on an estimate of the fair value of the vessels performed by management with the assistance of a
third-party valuation. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company incurred expenses of $14 million in each year related to this expected obligation. See
Note 28—

Subsequent Events

.

At
September 29, 2006, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by Electronics. This represents
the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a


communications
system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been
recorded in Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Class Actions

As a result of actions taken by the Company's former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of the Company's former senior corporate management, former
members of our Board of Directors and the Company's current Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel and former Chief Financial Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions
alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco, certain of the Company's current and former employees, some members of the Company's former senior corporate
management and some former members of the Company's Board of Directors also are named as defendants in several Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") class actions. In addition, some
members of the Company's former senior corporate management are subject to a SEC inquiry. The findings and outcomes of the SEC inquiry may affect the course of the purported securities class actions
and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco. The Company is generally obligated to indemnify its directors and officers and its former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or
all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, the Company's insurance carriers may decline coverage, or the Company's coverage may be insufficient to cover its expenses and
liability, in some or all of these matters. While the Company may from time to time seek to engage plaintiff's
counsel in settlement discussions, the Company is unable at this time to estimate what its ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that the Company will be required to pay
judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Investigations

The Company and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the United States Department of Labor, the General
Service Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into the Company's governance, management, operations, accounting and related
controls. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans. The Company cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can the
Company predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that the Company will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to
conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact the Company's business with non-governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of
these matters.


On
April 17, 2006, the Company reached a settlement that closes the SEC Enforcement Division's investigation of the Company regarding certain accounting practices and other
actions by former Tyco officers. On April 25, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in which the Company was ordered to pay $1 in
disgorgement and a fine of $50 million. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company satisfied the judgment which was accrued in 2005.

Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

As previously discussed in our periodic filings, the Company is a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to
pay damage awards. Tyco has assessed the status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.

Mallinckrodt, Inc. ("Mallinckrodt") and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc. ("Nellcor"), plaintiffs/counter-defendants v. Masimo Corporation ("Masimo") et
al., defendants/counter-claimants,

is a consolidated patent infringement action filed on June 19, 2000 in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. Nellcor is a subsidiary of Tyco. Nellcor alleges that Masimo infringed one Nellcor patent related to pulse oximeters, which are medical devices used to measure blood oxygen levels in
patients, and Masimo alleges that Nellcor infringed four Masimo patents related to pulse oximeters. Trial in the action commenced on February 18, 2004. On March 16, 2004, the jury
returned a liability finding that Nellcor willfully infringed the four Masimo patents and that Masimo did not infringe the one Nellcor patent. On March 26, 2004, the jury awarded Masimo
$135 million in damages for Nellcor's alleged infringement through December 31, 2003. After hearing post-trial motions, the district court issued an order on July 14,
2004 which (i) denied Masimo's request to impose an injunction on the sale of pulse oximeters; (ii) reversed the jury finding of patent infringement for one of the four patents at issue;
(iii) ruled that a second patent was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent; and (iv) overturned the jury finding that the infringement was "willful." On
August 6, 2004, the district court entered final judgment that included additional damages of $30 million for Nellcor's alleged infringement from January 1, 2004 through
May 31, 2004. Nellcor asserts that Masimo infringes a second Nellcor patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,934,372—the "372 patent"). On April 8, 2005, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Nellcor's favor that reversed the district court's summary judgment finding of no infringement regarding the 372 patent claim against Masimo. The
Court of Appeals remanded Nellcor's 372 patent claim to the district court for further proceedings. The district court has not yet scheduled trial in the 372 case.

Nellcor
appealed the jury's infringement finding on the remaining two Masimo patents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On September 7, 2005, the Court
of Appeals issued a decision on the appeal that was adverse to Nellcor. In particular, the Court of Appeals: (1) affirmed the infringement finding against Nellcor on two patents;
(2) reversed the district court's ruling of non-infringement of a third patent; and (3) reversed the district court's ruling not to enter an injunction and directed the
district court to issue an injunction. The Court of Appeals also: (1) affirmed the district court's ruling that Nellcor's infringement was not willful, which precluded Masimo from seeking up to
treble damages; and (2) affirmed the district court's ruling that one of Masimo's patents was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent. The Company has assessed
the amount of potential additional damages and interest accruing from the date


of
entry of final judgment to the present. Accordingly, during the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005, Tyco recorded a pre-tax charge of $277 million related to this
matter.

On
January 17, 2006, Tyco International Ltd., and its subsidiaries Tyco International (US) Inc., Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Mallinckrodt, Inc., and Nellcor
Puritan Bennett, Inc. (collectively "Nellcor") entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release of Claims with Masimo Corporation and Masimo Laboratories, Inc. (the "Settlement") related
to the consolidated patent infringement action.

Under
the terms of the Settlement, Tyco on behalf of Nellcor, paid Masimo a total of $330 million on January 19, 2006, which represents $265 million in damages in
the patent case for sales through January 31, 2006 (after which the infringing products will no longer be sold) and $65 million as an advance royalty for oximetry sales including
Nellcor's new 06 technology products from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. In 2005, Tyco recorded a liability of $277 million related to this matter. The Settlement
does not resolve the Masimo antitrust lawsuit or the related consumer antitrust class lawsuits described below. Under the terms of the Settlement, Nellcor received from Masimo a covenant not to sue on
the Nellcor 06 products as well as a termination of all pending patent litigation with Masimo. In March 2011, Nellcor has the option to terminate Masimo's covenant not to sue and the obligation
to pay future royalties on Nellcor's current products as well as any next-generation products. In addition, Nellcor will discontinue making, offering to sell, selling or shipping any
products that the court found infringed on the patents held by Masimo, but will continue to provide service and sensors for the previously sold products.

Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP ("Tyco Healthcare") and Mallinckrodt, Inc.

is a separate lawsuit filed on
May 22, 2002 also pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt are subsidiaries of Tyco. In this lawsuit, Masimo alleges
violations of antitrust laws against Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximeter products. Masimo alleges that Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt used their market position to
prevent hospitals from purchasing Masimo's pulse oximetry products. Masimo seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages. Trial in this case began on February 22, 2005.
The jury returned its verdict on March 21, 2005, and awarded Masimo $140 million in damages. The damages are automatically trebled under the antitrust statute to an award of
$420 million. If ultimately successful, Masimo's attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees and costs in addition to the verdict amount. The district court held a hearing on
June 28, 2005 regarding post-trial motions.

On
March 22, 2006, the district court issued its Memorandum of Decision regarding the post-trial motions. In the Memorandum, the district court (i) vacated the
jury's liability findings on two business practices; (ii) affirmed the jury's liability finding on two other business practices; (iii) vacated the jury's damage award in its entirety;
and (iv) ordered a new trial on damages. The district court held the new trial on the damages on October 18 and 19, 2006. After post-trial briefing, the district court will
issue its decision regarding the amount of damages to be awarded.

Tyco
has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remainder of the jury's decision will be overturned, and, further, Tyco intends to
vigorously pursue all available means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to this damage award.

Beginning

filed on January 27, 2006. In all twelve complaints the putative class
representatives, on behalf of themselves and others, seek to recover overcharges they allege they paid for pulse oximetry products as a result of anticompetitive conduct by Nellcor in violation of the
federal antitrust laws. The Company will respond to these complaints and intends to vigorously defend the actions. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses,
if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

As
previously reported in the Company's periodic filings,

Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") v. United States Surgical ("U.S.
Surgical")

is a patent infringement action that was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in April 1999 in which U.S.
Surgical, a subsidiary of Tyco, is the defendant. In February 2002, the district court held that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL universal seal system, contained in certain surgical trocar and access
devices manufactured by U.S. Surgical, infringed certain of the plaintiff's patents. The district court entered a permanent injunction against U.S. Surgical based upon infringement of one of the three
patents involved in the suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's permanent injunction ruling in September 2003 for the VERSASEAL product,
which is no longer on the market. In October 2003, the district court ruled in U.S. Surgical's favor, holding that two other patents involved in the case were invalid. A trial on damages for
the earlier infringement ruling in the district court concluded on July 27, 2004. The jury awarded Applied Medical $44 million in damages and returned a finding that the earlier
infringement was willful, giving the district court discretion to enhance those damages to up to treble the damages awarded to Applied Medical by the jury. On October 1, 2004, the district
court issued post-trial rulings that denied U.S. Surgical's motion to set aside the jury's finding on willfulness and granted Applied Medical's motion for enhanced damages, enhancing the
jury's damages award by 25%, or $11 million. On January 27, 2005, the district court awarded Applied Medical $10 million in costs, prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. Thus,
Applied Medical's total award was $65 million. U.S. Surgical appealed the damages award and the willfulness finding to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On January 24, 2006,
the Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the award to Applied Medical. On February 17, 2006, Tyco, on behalf of U.S. Surgical, paid Applied Medical $66 million which includes
post-judgment interest accrued during the appeal. Tyco previously recorded a liability of $66 million related to this matter.

On
July 31, 2003, Applied Medical filed another patent infringement suit against U.S. Surgical in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint alleges that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL Plus trocar product infringes Applied Medical's U.S. Patent No. 5,385,553. Applied Medical seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. Applied Medical filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,


which
the district court denied on December 23, 2003. On February 7, 2005, the district court granted U.S. Surgical's motion for summary judgment. Applied Medical appealed the summary
judgment ruling. On May 15, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision on the appeal vacating the district court's grant of summary judgment and
remanding the case for further proceedings. The district court has scheduled trial in this case for July 10, 2007. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any,
that might result from an adverse resolution of this matter.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site
cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of
September 29, 2006, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $124 million to $406 million. As of September 29,
2006, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $184 million, of which $34 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and
$150 million is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $184 million, the
Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Tyco
recorded asset retirement obligations (AROs) according to the provisions of SFAS No. 143, "

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations

," for the estimated future costs associated with legal obligations to decommission two nuclear facilities. With the clarification outlined by FIN No. 47 for
valuation of conditional AROs, Tyco reassessed its overall ARO and recorded an additional $32 million. As of September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, the Company's AROs were
$111 million and $69 million, respectively. The increase in the reserve during 2006 is primarily due to the adoption of FIN No. 47. In addition, the Company recorded an
insignificant amount of accretion, new cost estimates and foreign currency translation related to AROs during 2006. The Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See further discussions on the implementation of FIN No. 47 in Note 1.

Asbestos Matters

Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Consistent with
the national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed
against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a
subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat-resistant industrial products incorporating
asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants.


Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these
claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial
court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As
of September 29, 2006, there were approximately 15,500 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.

The
Company estimates its pending asbestos claims and claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Company's estimate of
the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has
adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes
that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities,
including the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts
related to these tax adjustments and
other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. While the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company anticipates that
certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007.

The
IRS continues to audit the years 1997 to 2000. In 2004 the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns, resulting in a
reduction in the taxable income previously reported. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. These adjustments did not have a material impact on the financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

During
2006, the Company has developed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined
that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and accordingly has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Compliance Matters

Tyco has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. During 2005, Tyco reported
to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has
retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would
continue to make periodic progress


reports
to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and will continue to have communications with the DOJ and SEC to
provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by the Company
in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate
the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters.

Other Matters

Earth Tech v. City of Phoenix

is a contract dispute arising from Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix,
Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. On December 21, 2005, Earth Tech filed a lawsuit against the City of Phoenix in the Maricopa County
Superior Court alleging $3 million in damages plus interest for the City's failure to pay dewatering and computer systems costs related to the 91

st

Avenue project. After the City
rejected Earth Tech's administrative claim against the City, Earth Tech filed and served a First Amended Complaint upon the City of Phoenix. In its First Amended Complaint, Earth Tech alleged eighteen
causes of action and requested the following: (i) a recovery of at least $73 million for the value of the services performed by Earth Tech in connection with the contract; (ii) a
rescission of the contract; (iii) an equitable adjustment of the Contract price for additional dewatering services and the Computer Control System; and (iv) costs for demobilization and
termination of the contract. The City of Phoenix filed a Motion to Dismiss rather than filing an answer to the First Amended Complaint on May 18, 2006. The Court granted the City's Motion to
Dismiss without prejudice on September 19, 2006 allowing Earth Tech 30 days to file a Second Amended Complaint. Earth Tech filed its Second Amended Compliant against the City of
Phoenix on September 25, 2006.

On
December 29, 2005, the City of Phoenix filed a lawsuit against Earth Tech, Inc., its surety, Federal Insurance Company and other unnamed parties in the Maricopa County
Superior Court,

The City of Phoenix v. Earth Tech, Inc., Federal Insurance Company and John Does 1-50.

The lawsuit is in connection
with the City of Phoenix's termination on August 12, 2005 of Earth Tech's contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for expansion of the City's 91

st

Avenue Waste Water Treatment
Plant. The City alleges the following causes of action: (i) Earth Tech breached its Pre-Construction Services and Construction Management at Risk Contracts; (ii) Earth Tech
did not properly, reasonably or timely manage, supervise or inspect the work under the Contracts; (iii) Federal Insurance breached the terms and conditions of the performance bond; and
(iv) Federal Insurance failed to investigate the City's Bond Claims. The City requested unspecified general, consequential, incidental, special and liquidated damages plus interest as its
relief. On February 8, 2006, Earth Tech filed a Motion to Dismiss the City's Complaint in which Federal Insurance Company joined. The Court denied Earth Tech's Motion to Dismiss on
September 25, 2006. The City of Phoenix filed an Amended Complaint against Earth Tech and Federal Insurance on September 25, 2006. In the Amended Complaint, the City of Phoenix alleged
damages of $128 million.

The
Presiding Judge of Maricopa County Superior Court on July 11, 2006 consolidated all of the pending lawsuits related to this dispute on the Court's complex litigation docket.
At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of this
matter.


The
Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the
outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

19.    Retirement Plans

Measurement Date—

In 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and post retirement
benefit plans from September 30

th

to August 31

st

, effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement
date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting
deadlines. Accordingly, all amounts presented as of and for the years ended September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 reflect an August 31 measurement date, while prior years
reflect a September 30 measurement date. The Company has accounted for the change in measurement date as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the accounting principle
change as of the beginning of 2005 was a $21 million after-tax gain ($28 million pretax). The effects of this change in measurement date did not have a material effect on net periodic
benefit costs.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans
covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic
actuarial valuations which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service
lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans
are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. The following tables exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

The
net periodic benefit cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans for 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows ($ in millions):

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. plans as of September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was $2,363 million and
$2,465 million, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for all


non-U.S.
plans as of September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was $3,192 million and $2,870 million, respectively.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2,355 million and
$2,149 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006 and $2,465 million and $2,126 million, respectively, at September 30, 2005.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$3,051 million and $2,097 million, respectively, at September 29, 2006 and $2,738 million and $1,796 million, respectively, at September 30, 2005.

In
determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations as provided by
its external advisors.

The
Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a superior return on assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40%
allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S. pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 54% to equity securities, 40% to
debt securities and 6% to other asset classes, including real estate and cash equivalents.

Pension
plans have the following weighted-average asset allocations at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005:

Although
the Company does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly
hold Tyco stock. The aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that at a minimum it will make
the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in 2007 of $10 million for the U.S. plans and $141 million for non-U.S. plans.


Benefit
payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows ($ in millions):

The
Company also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit plans on behalf of certain employees. Pension expense related to multi-employer plans was $6 million,
$15 million and $13 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Executive Retirement Arrangements

—Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz participated in individual Executive Retirement
Arrangements maintained by Tyco (the "ERA"). Under the ERA, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz would have fixed lifetime benefits commencing at their normal retirement age of 65. The Company's
accrued benefit obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 29, 2006 were $66 million and $34 million, respectively. The Company's accrued benefit
obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 30, 2005 were $62 million and $32 million, respectively. Retirement benefits are available at earlier ages and
alternative forms of benefits can be elected. Any such variations would be actuarially equivalent to the fixed lifetime benefit starting at age 65. Amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz
under the ERA are in dispute by the Company.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

—The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include
401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants'
compensation and was $204 million, $190 million and $175 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company also maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan ("SERP"). This plan is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to IRS limits on eligible compensation under the defined contribution plans. Expense related to
the SERP was $3 million in 2006, $6 million in 2005 and $3 million in 2004.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer
a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts.
The measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation expense was
$10 million, $14 million and $15 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $179 million and $171 million at
September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Rabbi Trusts—

The Company has rabbi trusts, the assets of which may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The
trusts primarily hold corporate-owned life insurance policies, cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity securities. At September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, trust assets


totaled
$399 million and $388 million, respectively. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policies, net of outstanding loans, included in the rabbi trust was
$228 million and $218 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. The rabbi trust assets, which are consolidated, are subject to the claims of the
Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. Plan participants are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

—The Company generally does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions for its
employees. However, certain acquired operations provide these benefits to employees who were eligible at the date of acquisition, and a small number of U.S. and Canadian operations provide on going
eligibility for such benefits.

For
measurement purposes, a 10.1% and 11.5% composite annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed at September 29, 2006 and
September 30, 2005, respectively. At September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, the composite annual rate of increase in health care benefit costs was assumed to decrease
gradually to 5.0% by the year 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects ($ in

Effect on postretirement benefit obligation


(25

)

In
December 2003, the US enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. Certain of the Company's


retiree
medical programs already provided prescription drug coverage for retirees over age 65 that were at least as generous as the benefits provided under Medicare. This Act reduces the Company's
obligation in these instances. The Company included the effects of the Act in the Consolidated Financial Statements by reducing net periodic benefit cost by $12 million for 2005, and reflecting
an actuarial gain which reduced its accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately $64 million at September 30, 2005.

20.    Shareholder's Equity

Preference Shares

—Tyco has authorized 125,000,000 preference shares, par value of $1 per share, none
of which were issued and outstanding at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005. Rights as to dividends, return of capital, redemption, conversion, voting and otherwise with respect to
the preference shares may be determined by Tyco's Board of Directors on or before the time of issuance. In the event of the liquidation of the Company, the holders of any preference shares then
outstanding would be entitled to payment to them of the amount for which the preference shares were subscribed and any unpaid dividends prior to any payment to the common shareholders.

Dividends

—On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the Company's
common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0125 in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.10 thereafter. Prior to that, Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.0125 per common share.

Shares Owned by Subsidiaries

—Shares owned by subsidiaries are treated as treasury shares and are recorded at cost.

Share Repurchase Program

—In July 2005 and May 2006, Tyco's Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs
of $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. During 2006, the Company repurchased 45 million of common shares for $1.2 billion completing the $1.5 billion share
repurchase program and 50 million of common shares for $1.3 billion under the $2.0 billion share repurchase program. During 2005, the Company repurchased 10 million of
common shares for $300 million.

21.    Share Plans

As previously mentioned, the Company recorded compensation amounts for prior periods related to errors in the Company's stock option accounting and in the
recognition of expense under the Company's employee stock purchase program in the United Kingdom. As such, the reported results for prior periods have been restated to reflect the impact of such
additional stock-based compensation expense.

Effective
October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the
compensation cost recognized beginning October 1, 2005 includes compensation cost for (i) all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of October 1, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all share-based payments granted subsequent to
September 30, 2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the
requisite service period or period to retirement eligibility, if shorter. Prior period amounts have not been restated for the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.


As
a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company's results for the year ended September 29, 2006 include incremental share-based compensation expense of
$161 million. The total share-based compensation cost during 2006, 2005 (restated) and 2004 (restated) of $282 million, $105 million and $126 million, respectively, has
been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income within selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based
compensation arrangements during 2006, 2005 (restated) and 2004 (restated) of $85 million, $36 million and $37 million, respectively.

Prior
to October 1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS
No. 123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at the date of grant.
Had the fair value based method as prescribed
by SFAS No. 123 been applied by Tyco, the effect on net income and earnings per share for 2005 and 2004 would have been as follows ($ in millions, except per share data):

During
2004, the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") effectively replaced the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term
Incentive Plan, as amended as of May 12, 1999 (the "LTIP I Plan"), the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan"), as well as the Tyco
International Ltd. 1994 Restricted Stock Ownership Plan for Key Employees (the "1994 Plan") for all awards effective on and after March 25, 2004. The 2004 Plan provides for the award of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long term performance awards, restricted units, restricted stock, deferred stock units, promissory stock and other stock-based
awards (collectively, "Awards").

The
2004 Plan provides for a maximum of 160 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan. In addition, any
common shares that have been approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the LTIP Plans but which have not been awarded thereunder as of January 1, 2004, reduced by the number of
common shares related to Awards made under the LTIP Plans between January 1, 2004 and March 25, 2004, the date the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, (or which have been awarded but
will not be issued, owing to expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004) and which are no longer
available for any reason (including the termination of the LTIP Plans) will also be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan.


When
common shares are issued pursuant to a grant of restricted stock and restricted units (collectively, "restricted share awards"), deferred stock units, promissory stock, and performance units or
as payment of an annual performance bonus or other stock-based award, the total number of common shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per common share
issued. At September 29, 2006, there were approximately 162 million shares available for future grant under the 2004 Plan (including shares available under both the LTIP I and LTIP II
Plans that are now assumable under the 2004 Plan).

The
1994 Plan provided for the issuance of restricted stock grants to officers and non-officer employees. The 1994 Plan expired in November 2004; thus no additional
grants of restricted stock have been made under this plan since November 2004 and no shares are available for future grant. At September 29, 2006, 30 million shares had been
granted, of which 14 million were granted under the 2004 Plan and 16 million were granted under the 1994 Plan.

The
LTIP I Plan reserved common shares for issuance to Tyco's directors, executives and managers as share options. This plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which consists exclusively of independent directors of the Company. Tyco had reserved 140 million common shares for issuance under the LTIP I
Plan. At September 29, 2006, there were approximately 29 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan but now available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

The
LTIP II Plan was a broad-based option plan for non-officer employees. Tyco had reserved 100 million common shares for issuance under the LTIP II Plan. The terms
and conditions of this plan are similar to the LTIP I Plan. At September 29, 2006, there were approximately 35 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan that are
now available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

Share Options

—Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of
the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over
a period of three years and will generally expire 10 years
after the date of grant. Options assumed as part of business combination transactions are administered under Tyco's plan but do not reduce the available shares and retain all the rights, terms and
conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.

At
September 29, 2006, approximately 401 million share options had been granted, of which 230 million, 124 million and 47 million were granted under
the LTIP I, LTIP II and 2004 Plans, respectively.

The
grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model
inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock and implied volatility derived from exchange traded options. The average expected life was based on
the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are


estimated
based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for 2006, 2005
and 2004 are as follows:

cash inflow for 2006 was not significant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

—Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and
employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in an employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the
purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All shares purchased under the plan are purchased
on the open market by a designated broker.

The
Company also maintains two other employee stock purchase plans for the benefit of employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries. The terms of these plans provide
for the Company to grant to its employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's stock at a stated price and receive certain tax benefits.

Under
one plan, operated in Ireland, eligible employees are offered the opportunity to acquire shares using a portion of their bonus or, alternatively, receive a cash bonus subject to
normal taxation.


Such
employees also have the opportunity to forego a portion of their basic salary to purchase additional shares. As of September 29, 2006, there were 1 million shares available for
future issuance under this plan.

Under
the second plan, the Save-As-You-Earn ("SAYE") Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom are granted options to purchase shares at the end
of
three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options under the SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of
vesting. The SAYE Plan provides for a maximum of 10 million common shares to be issued; as of September 29, 2006, there were 7 million shares available for future issuance. All of
the shares purchased under both the SAYE Plan and the Irish Bonus Plan are purchased on the open market.

The
grant-date-fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions for expected volatility, the average expected life,
and the risk-free rate were made using the same methodology as previously described under

Share Options

.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted under the SAYE Plan during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $8.80, $12.65, and $12.09, respectively. The total intrinsic
value of options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $24 million, $3 million and $0, respectively. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for 2006
was not significant.

As
of September 29, 2006, there was $7 million in total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options granted under the SAYE Plan. The cost is expected to be
recognized over a period of 2.0 fiscal years.

Restricted Share Awards

—Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are
determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon normal retirement, death or disability of the employee.

For
grants which vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market value of the shares or units is expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of
criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair
value of restricted share


awards
is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest after a period of three years, as determined by the Compensation
Committee, upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels, if applicable. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated
forfeitures.

Recipients
of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents.

A
summary of the status of the Company's restricted share awards and performance shares as of September 29, 2006 and changes during the year then ended is presented in the tables

As

shares. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 fiscal years.

Deferred Stock Units

—Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco common shares with
distribution deferred until termination of employment. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the fair
value of DSUs is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote
such shares and do not have the right to receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to receive dividend equivalents. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Under the 2004
Plan, the majority of Tyco's DSU grants vest in equal annual installments over


three
years. The Company has granted 2 million DSUs, of which all but 0.1 million were outstanding at September 29, 2006.

28.    Subsequent Events

On October 27, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its PCG business, which was part of the Electronics segment, for $226 million and expects to
record a gain on the sale of approximately $45 million.

On
October 27, 2006, Mark H. Swartz, former Chief Financial Officer and Director, paid restitution to the Company in the amount of $38 million. In addition, on
November 17, 2006, the Supreme Court of the State of New York ordered $98 million to be released from an escrow account under the supervision of the Manhattan District Attorney to Tyco on
January 2, 2007 in relation to the restitution owed by L. Dennis Kozlowski, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

On
October 31, 2006, the Company exercised its right to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously included under an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement
for $280 million.

In
November 2006, the Company announced that it has launched a restructuring program across all segments including the corporate organization which will streamline some of the
businesses and reduce Tyco's operational footprint. The Company obtained approval from the Board of Directors for up to $600 million over the next two years for related costs.

Through
December 8, 2006, the Company repurchased an additional 9.2 million of its common shares for $279 million under the $2.0 billion share repurchase
program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006.
