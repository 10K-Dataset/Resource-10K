During
the first quarter of 2011, the Company will realign our Safety Products segment between our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments. Our existing ADT Worldwide and Fire
Protection segments will create two new businesses: Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection.

Tyco
Security Solutions will consist of our ADT Worldwide segment as well as manufacturing security products including intrusion, security, access control and video management systems
previously



manufactured
by our Safety Products segment. Tyco Fire Protection will consist of our Fire Protection segment as well as a number of businesses in our Safety Products segment including our fire
suppression and building products and life safety products businesses.

As
a result of this realignment, as well as the planned sale of a 51% interest of our Electrical and Metal Products business (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements), we will have three core businesses: Tyco Security Solutions, Tyco Fire Protection and Flow Control.

Unless
otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2010, 2009 and 2008 are to Tyco's fiscal years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and
September 26, 2008, respectively.

History and Development

Tyco International Ltd.

Tyco International Ltd. is a Company organized under the laws of Switzerland. The Company was created as a result of the
July 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited, a public company organized under the laws of Bermuda, at which time ADT Limited changed its name
to Tyco International Ltd. Effective March 17, 2009, following shareholder and Board of Director approval on March 12, 2009, the Company ceased to exist as a Bermuda corporation and
continued its existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile").

Effective
June 29, 2007, Tyco International Ltd. completed the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly our Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into
separate, publicly traded companies (the "Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders.

During
the third quarter of 2010, we announced our intention to pursue a tax-free spin-off of our Electrical and Metal Products business. On November 9, 2010, we announced an
agreement to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. In connection with this announcement, we no longer plan to pursue the tax-free spin-off of our
Electrical and Metal Products business as proposed on April 27, 2010. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On
May 14, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS" or "Broadview Security") in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at
approximately $2.0 billion, with $585 million in cash being used to fund the acquisition. Broadview Security is being integrated into the Company's ADT Worldwide segment.

Tyco's
registered and principal office is located at Freier Platz 10, CH-8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Its management office in the United States is located at 9 Roszel Road,
Princeton, New Jersey 08540.

Segments

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. During the third quarter of 2010,
our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our water business in Europe, which is part of our Flow Control segment. The business met the held for sale criteria and discontinued operations criteria
and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, during fiscal 2010 we aligned certain business operations
resulting in prior period segment amounts being recast. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ADT Worldwide

Our ADT Worldwide segment designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems for residential, commercial,
educational, governmental and industrial customers around the



world.
We are one of the world's largest providers of electronic security systems and services. We have a significant market presence in North and South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
With 2010 net revenue of $7.4 billion, our ADT Worldwide segment comprises 44% of our consolidated net
revenue. In 2009 and 2008, net revenue totaled $7.1 billion, or 42%, of our consolidated net revenue and $7.8 billion, or 39%, of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.

On
May 14, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS" or "Broadview Security") in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at
approximately $2.0 billion, with $585 million in cash being used to fund the acquisition. Broadview Security is being integrated into the Company's ADT Worldwide segment. Broadview Security's
core business is to provide security alarm monitoring services for residential and commercial properties in North America. It has a large residential recurring customer base, which has enhanced ADT's
presence in the North American residential security business. Broadview Security is also a leader in technologies and services which are expected to enhance ADT Worldwide's service offerings to its
customers. In connection with the integration of Broadview Security into the ADT Worldwide segment, the Broadview Security brand has been discontinued. We expect to realize cost savings and other
synergies through operational efficiencies including consolidation of both marketing and general and administrative functions. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Services and Products

ADT Worldwide supplies and installs electronic security systems to the residential, commercial, educational, governmental and
industrial markets. It also provides electronic security services, including monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety conditions as well as maintenance of electronic security
systems. A significant portion of the components used in our electronic security systems are manufactured by our Safety Products segment.

Our
electronic security systems business involves the installation and use of security systems designed to detect intrusion, control access and react to movement, fire, smoke, flooding,
environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These electronic security systems include detection devices that are usually connected to a monitoring center that receives and
records alarm signals where skilled security monitoring specialists verify alarm conditions and initiate a range of response scenarios. For most systems, control panels identify the nature of the
alarm and the areas where a sensor was triggered. Our other solutions include: access control systems for sensitive areas such as government facilities and banks; video surveillance systems designed
to deter theft and fraud and help protect employees and customers; and asset protection and security management systems designed to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary
electronic data. Our offerings also include anti-theft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification ("RFID") tags and labels in the retail industry. Many of the world's
leading retailers use our

Sensormatic

anti-theft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft.

Purchasers
of our intrusion systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. Systems installed at
customers' premises may be either owned by ADT Worldwide or by our customers. Monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local fire or police departments,
notifying the customer
or taking other appropriate action. In certain markets, ADT Worldwide directly provides the alarm response services with highly trained and professionally equipped employees. In some instances, alarm
systems are connected directly to local fire or police departments.

Many
of our residential customers may purchase security systems as a result of prompting by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system
is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition of coverage.



Customers

ADT Worldwide sells to residential, commercial, educational, governmental and industrial customers. Our residential customers typically
include owners of single-family homes or renters in multi-family apartment complexes. Our commercial customers include, among others, retail businesses, financial institutions, commercial/industrial
facilities and health care facilities. Our government customers include federal, state and local governments, defense installations, schools and mass transportation providers. In addition to
advertising, direct mailings and the internet, we market our electronic security systems and services to these customers through a direct sales force and, with respect to certain residential
customers, through an authorized dealer network. A separate sales force services large commercial and governmental customers and focuses on key vertical markets such as retail and banking.

Competition

The electronic security services business is highly competitive and fragmented with a number of major firms and thousands of smaller
regional and local companies. Competition is based primarily on price in relation to quality of service. Rather than compete purely on price, we emphasize the quality of our electronic security
service, the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of our customers' security needs. For large commercial, educational, governmental and industrial customers the comprehensive national and/or
global coverage offered by ADT Worldwide can also provide a competitive advantage. We also have significantly expanded our systems integration capabilities, which allow ADT Worldwide to offer
comprehensive solutions to customers that fully integrate security and fire offerings into comprehensive IT networks, business operations and management tools, and process automation and control
systems.

Flow Control

Our Flow Control segment designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products
for general process, energy and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater market. We believe we are the world's leading manufacturer of flow control products. With 2010 net revenue of
$3.4 billion, our Flow Control segment comprises 20% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2009 and 2008, net revenue totaled $3.5 billion, or 21%, of our consolidated net revenue and $3.9
billion, or 20%, of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. Flow Control is a global business with 30% of its sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), 29% from the Americas, 26% from the
Pacific region and 15% from Asia. During the third quarter of 2010, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our water business in Europe. This business met the held for sale and discontinued
operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale of this business closed on September 30, 2010.

Services and Products

Flow Control designs, manufactures and services a wide variety of valves, actuators, controls, pipes, fittings and heat tracing
products. Valve products include a broad range of industrial valves, including on-off valves, safety relief valves and other specialty valves. Actuation products include pneumatic, hydraulic and
electric actuators. Control products include limit switches, solenoid valves, valve positioners, network systems and accessories. For the water market, Flow Control offers a wide variety of pipes and
valves, for water transmission applications. Flow Control is also a global provider of heat tracing services and products. In addition to these core products, Flow Control makes a variety of specialty
products for environmental (emissions monitoring, water flow and quality monitoring, dust filter cleaning systems), instrumentation (manifolds, enclosures, isolation valves) and other applications. We
manufacture these products in facilities located throughout the world.



Flow
Control products are used in many applications including power generation, chemical, petrochemical, oil and gas, wastewater, pulp and paper, commercial irrigation, mining and food
and beverage. Flow Control also provides engineering, design, inspection, maintenance and repair services for its valves and related products.

Flow
Control products are sold under many trade names, including

Anderson Greenwood, Biffi, Crosby, Keystone, KTM, Raychem, Sempell,
Tracer

and

Vanessa.

Flow Control sells its services and products in most geographic regions directly through its internal sales
force and in some cases through a network of independent distributors and manufacturers' representatives.

Customers

Flow Control's customers include businesses engaged in a wide range of industries, including power generation, chemical and
petrochemical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas exploration, production and refining, mining, water, food and beverage, marine and shipbuilding and other process industries. Customers include end users as
well as engineering, procurement and construction companies, contractors, original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and distributors. Flow Control operates an extensive network of sales, service and
distribution centers to serve a wide range of global customers.

Competition

The flow control industry is highly fragmented, consisting of many local and regional companies and a few global competitors. We
compete against a number of international, national and local manufacturers of industrial valves as well as against specialized manufacturers on the basis of product capability, product quality,
breadth of product line, delivery and price. Our major competitors vary by region.

Fire Protection Services

Our Fire Protection Services segment designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems for commercial
enterprises, governmental entities, airports, commercial shipping companies, transportation systems, healthcare owners, petrochemical facilities and homeowners. We believe we are one of the largest
providers of these systems and services. With 2010 net revenue of $3.3 billion, our Fire Protection Services segment comprises 19% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2009 and 2008, net revenue
totaled $3.4 billion, or 20%, of our consolidated net revenue and $3.8 billion, or 19%, of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.

Services and Products

Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire alarm and fire detection systems, automatic fire sprinkler systems
and special hazard suppression systems. Fire Protection Services operates under various leading trade names, including

SimplexGrinnell, Wormald, Mather & Platt, Dong Bang,
Zettler

and

Tyco.

A significant portion of the components used in our fire detection and fire suppression systems are
manufactured by our Safety Products segment.

Fire
Protection Services offers a wide range of fire alarm and fire detection systems. These alarm and detection systems include fire alarm control panels, advanced fire alarm monitoring
systems, smoke, heat and carbon monoxide detectors, voice evacuation systems and emergency lighting systems. Fire Protection Services also offers a wide range of fire suppression systems, the majority
of which are water-based sprinkler systems. In addition, Fire Protection Services provides custom designed special hazard suppression systems, which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such
as foams, dry chemicals and gases, in addition to spill control products designed to absorb, neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous materials. These systems are often especially suited to fire
suppression in certain



manufacturing,
power generation, petrochemical, offshore oil exploration, transportation, data processing, telecommunications, commercial food preparation, mining and marine applications.

Fire
Protection Services installs fire detection and fire suppression systems in both new and existing buildings. These systems typically are purchased by owners, construction engineers
and electrical contractors as well as mechanical or general contractors. In recent years, retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire
detection and fire suppression systems, especially in hotels, healthcare facilities and educational establishments. In September 2008, the International Residential Code Council, a non-profit
association that develops model codes that are the predominant building and fire safety regulations used by states and jurisdictions in the United States, adopted a proposal advanced by firefighters
and other life-safety advocates to require sprinkler systems in new one and two family dwellings effective in January 2011. This national code must be adopted by states and jurisdictions in
order for it to be applied to new homes being built in that area. The timing of adoption will vary by state / district. Fire Protection Services also continues to focus on system maintenance and
inspection, which have become increasingly significant parts of its business.

Customers

Fire Protection Services' customers include commercial enterprises, governmental entities, airports, commercial shipping companies,
transportation systems, healthcare facility owners, petrochemical facilities and homeowners. We market our fire detection and fire suppression systems to the majority of these customers through a
direct sales force.

Competition

Competition in the fire detection and fire suppression business varies by region. In North America, we compete with hundreds of smaller
contractors on a regional or local basis for the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems. In Europe, we compete with many regional or local contractors on a country-by-country
basis. In Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we compete with a few large fire detection and fire suppression contractors, as well as with many smaller regional and local companies. We compete for fire
detection and fire suppression systems contracts primarily on the basis of service, quality and price.

Electrical and Metal Products

During the third quarter of 2010, we announced our intention to pursue a tax-free spin-off of our Electrical and Metal Products
business. On November 9, 2010, we announced an agreement to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. In connection with this announcement, we no longer plan to pursue
the tax-free spin-off of our Electrical and Metal Products business as proposed on April 27, 2010. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
Electrical and Metal Products segment designs, manufactures and sells galvanized steel tubing and pipe products, pre-wired armored electrical cables, electrical support systems and
metal framing systems for trade contractors in the construction and modernization of non-residential structures such as commercial office buildings, institutional facilities, manufacturing plants and
warehouses, shopping centers and multi-family dwellings. In North America, our Allied Tube & Conduit business is a leading manufacturer of electrical steel conduit and our AFC Cable Systems business
is a leading manufacturer of steel and aluminum pre-wired electrical cable. Electrical and Metal Products also manufactures and sells cable tray systems, steel tubes, tiles, plates and other specialty
formed steel products in South America, Asia Pacific and EMEA. With 2010 net revenue of $1.4 billion, our Electrical and Metal Products segment comprises 8% of our consolidated net revenue. In
2009 and 2008, net revenue



totaled
$1.4 billion, or 8%, of our consolidated net revenue and $2.3 billion, or 12%, of our consolidated net revenue, respectively.

The
market prices of key raw materials such as steel and copper have a significant impact on the segment's operating results. In particular, the difference between amounts paid for these
raw materials and the selling price charged to customers for the range of value-add products manufactured from these raw materials significantly impacts operating results. As a result, this segment
maintains diligent focus on raw material purchases, manufacturing processes, pricing and sales strategies.

Services and Products

Electrical and Metal Products designs and manufactures galvanized steel tubing and pipe products that include electrical conduit, fire
sprinkler pipe, light gauge steel tube and fence pipe. These steel tube and pipe products are sold under the brand names

Allied Tube & Conduit

Customers

The majority of the products manufactured by Electrical and Metal Products are used by trade contractors in the construction and
modernization of non-residential structures such as commercial office buildings, institutional facilities, manufacturing plants and warehouses, shopping centers and multi-family dwellings. Nearly 95%
of these products are sold through wholesale distribution to trade contractors; the remaining 5% are sold to smaller contractors and homeowners through big-box home improvement retailers.
Distribution-based sales account for 75% of the total revenue for the Electrical and Metal Products segment.

The
other major customer segment, representing approximately 25% of revenue, is the OEM market. The steel tubes supplied by Electrical and Metal Products are ultimately used as a
component for OEM products in commercial or industrial end markets. Steel tubular products are sold direct to OEMs or through metals distributors.

Competition

The market for electrical conduit and wiring and supports, fire protection and security products and steel tubing includes a broad
range of competitors. Principal competitors range from national manufacturers to smaller regional players. Customers purchase from Electrical and Metal Products because of the product availability,
breadth of product line and the premium quality of products.

Customers

In addition to selling to our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, Safety Products sells its products primarily through
indirect distribution channels around the world. These business partners sell to customers including contractors that install fire suppression, security and theft protection systems. Some of our
partners are integrators and install the products themselves; others act as dealers and sell to smaller fire and security contractors. Our customers for our breathing apparatus include fire
departments, municipal and state governments and military forces as well as major companies in the Industrial sector. Customers for our fire sprinkler products include distributors, commercial
builders and contractors. Residential builders, contractors and developers are emerging customers for our sprinkler products given changing regulatory dynamics.

Competition

Competition for the manufacture and sale of our products is based on specialized product capacity, breadth of product line, price,
training and support and delivery. The principal competitors are specialty products manufacturing companies based in the United States, with other smaller competitors in Europe and Asia.

Backlog

See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information relating to our
backlog.



Intellectual Property

Patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets,
manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including
trademarks, patents and patent applications, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities
and misappropriation of our proprietary rights, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to: electronic security systems; fire protection products and systems, including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical,
gas, foam and water agents, piping, couplings, fittings for fluid systems; personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards; integrated systems for surveillance and control of
public transportation and other public works; structural and electrical tubing and conduit; building structural members, panels and related fixtures; fire-rated and armored electrical cabling; heat
tracing and floor heating systems; security wire and fencing; and flow control products, including valves, actuators and controllers and airflow control and sensing products. We also own a portfolio
of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of
patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.

While
we consider our patents to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall operations are
dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Research and Development

We are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety
and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate. We continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe
will enhance our business for possible investment. Our research and development expense was $131 million in 2010, $116 million in 2009 and $125 million in 2008.

Raw and Other Purchased Materials

We are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including gasoline. Materials are purchased from a large number of independent
sources around the world. There have been no shortages in materials that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. We enter into long-term supply contracts, using fixed or variable pricing
to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions. Significant changes in certain raw material costs have had, and may in the future have, an adverse impact on costs and operating margins. In
particular, the Electrical and Metal Products segment is significantly affected by volatility in the price of steel and copper, with operating margins generally contracting in a declining price
environment and expanding when prices of these commodities are rising.

Governmental Regulation and Supervision

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in
areas such as: consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states in which we
operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. Our ADT Worldwide business currently relies extensively upon



the
use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals, and wireline and wireless telephone companies in the United States are regulated by the federal and state governments.
Another example is our Flow Control business, which is subject to strict regulations governing the import and export of goods and technologies across international borders, particularly with respect
to "dual use" products, which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation. In addition, government regulation of fire safety
codes can impact our Fire Protection Services business. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can
affect our worldwide operations, both positively and negatively. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other
things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals. We have received notification from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible
remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of
current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.

Given
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods, the ultimate cost of cleanup at
disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict. Based upon our experience, current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws, we concluded that it is probable
that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $27 million to $85 million. As of September 24, 2010, we concluded that the best estimate within this range is
approximately $34 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $16 million is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of September 24, 2010, we employed approximately 108,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 41,000 are employed in the
United States and 67,000 are outside the United States. Approximately 29,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the
labor unions are generally good.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The
risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as technological obsolescence, labor relations, geopolitical
events, climate change and international operations.

Risks Relating to Our Businesses

General economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of
certain industries in which we operate. For example, demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial construction, the amount of discretionary consumer and
business spending, and the performance of the housing market, each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality. Recent economic weakness has adversely affected our businesses. For
example, weakness in the North American and European non-residential construction markets have adversely impacted the system installation and service portion of our ADT Worldwide business, and weak
global economic conditions have also adversely impacted our Flow Control business. Continued weakness in the U.S. or global economies, or in the industries in which we operate, could have a material
negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



We face intense competition in each of our businesses, and competitive challenges from lower cost manufacturers. If we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global
market-place, our operating results may be adversely affected.

We operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service
providers, both domestically and on a global basis. Our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in Asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from
alternative service providers around the world. Key components of our competitive position are our ability to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully. This
requires continuous management focus on reducing costs, maintaining our competitive position and improving efficiency through cost controls, productivity enhancements and regular appraisal of our
asset portfolio. If we are unable to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or cost-effectiveness, or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace, our
operating results may be adversely affected.

Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to successfully compete with new and existing competitors by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve
market acceptance with acceptable margins.

Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards and
potential new entrants in our markets. For example, a number of cable and other telecommunications companies have introduced interactive security services that are competitive with the products and
services offered through our ADT Worldwide business. Although these competitive products and services are currently in the initial stages of development and test marketing, if they were to be
aggressively marketed and gained market acceptance, our ability to grow our ADT Worldwide business could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, our future success depends upon a number of
factors, including our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; develop, acquire and maintain competitive products and services; enhance our products and services
by adding innovative features that differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors; and develop or acquire, manufacture and bring products and services to market quickly and
cost-effectively. Our ability to develop or acquire new products and services based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant
resources. These acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies, products or
services on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products
and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate. As a result, the failure of our technology, products or services to gain market acceptance or their obsolescence could significantly reduce our
revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our ADT business may experience higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related
to our security monitoring customers, increasing our depreciation and amortization expense.

Although attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business decreased over the prior year to an average of 12.8% for 2010, as
compared to 13.3% for 2009, and 12.9% in 2008, attrition rates may increase in the future due to reasons such as customer dissatisfaction or competitive offerings. In periods of increasing attrition
rates, ADT's recurring revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. The risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty. Tyco amortizes the costs of ADT's contracts and
related customer relationships purchased through the ADT dealer program based on the estimated life of the customer relationships. Internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly
depreciated. If attrition rates were to rise significantly,



Tyco
may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

We have significant operations outside of the United States, which are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the United States.

We generated 51% of our net revenue outside of the United States in 2010. We expect net revenue generated outside of the United States
to continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenue. Business operations outside of the United States are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in
certain countries, such as:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of certain labor regulations outside of the
United States;

•

compliance with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and regulations;

•

changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging
markets;

•

the threat of nationalization and expropriation;

•

increased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions;

•

changes in enacted tax laws;

•

limitations on repatriation of earnings; and

•

fluctuations in revenues, operating margins and other financial measures due to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.

Changes
in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

Volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition, result of operations or cash flows.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest
rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our
net revenue derived from sales in non-U.S. markets for 2010 was 51% of our total net revenue, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant
portion of our total net revenue. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar has strengthened in relation to the principle foreign currencies where we derive revenue as compared to a prior period, our U.S. dollar
reported revenue and income will decrease, and vice-versa. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances, may have a significant effect on our results of
operations. Our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars, our functional currency (using year-end exchange rates for balance sheet data and
average exchange rates for statement of operations data).

In
addition, we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet, the prices of which have fluctuated
significantly in



recent
years. Increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our
customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, in a declining price
environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first-out method. This is most pronounced in our Electrical and Metal Products segment, which we
have agreed to sell a 51% interest, where fluctuations in the price of copper and steel can negatively affect both revenue and operating margins.

We
monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these
fluctuations. These hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. For example, we recently
announced that we have agreed to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business segment to an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, LLC for approximately $720 million. The
sale is expected to close in the first half of 2011. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's
attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the
divested business. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business
or product line.

Our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful
or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:

•

diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;

•

difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;

•

inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;

•

potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships, or key customers of acquired companies or of us;
and

•

assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies.

It
may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations. Any acquisitions or investments may
ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges.



If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely
basis, or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may suffer.

We purchase materials, components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations. If we cannot obtain
sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments
may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. In addition, because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing
capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market
acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Failure to retain or attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.

The Company's culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training, motivating and developing employees, and in particular it
strives to attract, motivate and retain qualified managers to handle the day-to-day operations of a highly diversified organization. If we fail to retain and attract qualified personnel, the Company's
operations could be adversely affected. In addition, excessive turnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies in certain of our businesses. The demand for experienced management in
certain geographic areas also makes it difficult to retain qualified employees. High turnover could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could adversely impact the Company's operating
results.

We have recognized substantial impairment charges in the past and may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future.

Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill,
intangibles and other long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in
operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. During the second fiscal quarter of
2009, we recognized aggregate goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $2.7 billion, resulting primarily from a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market in
certain of our businesses; a decline in sales volume at our Electrical and Metal Products segment; and downward revisions to forecasted results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks. As
a result, the Company recognized an aggregate goodwill impairment of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after-tax) at six of our reporting units and intangible asset impairments of
$64 million ($40 million after-tax). The Company believes that our goodwill balance as of September 24, 2010 is recoverable. However, fair value determinations require
considerable judgment and are sensitive to change. Additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment
analysis. Future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.



Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters

We are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are subject to a significant number of claims and are named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits, including claims for damages
arising out of the use or installation of our products or services, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior, litigation
related to environmental matters, product liability litigation (including asbestos-related claims), and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes. In certain circumstances, patent
infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in
defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss
exposures.

Legislative action by the U.S. Congress could materially, adversely affect us.

Legislative action could be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we rely,
which would adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of
disregarding our incorporation in Switzerland or limiting our ability as a Swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between Switzerland and the United States, we could be subjected to
increased taxation. Also, various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that deny, or would deny, government contracts to U.S. companies that move their
locations abroad. We cannot assure you that such legislation, if enacted, would not apply to us.

In
addition, there continues to be negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, companies that conduct substantial business in the U.S. but are domiciled abroad. We cannot assure you
that we will not be subject to such criticism as a result of our domicile in Switzerland.

Changes in legislation or governmental regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We operate in regulated industries. Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and local governmental
agencies with respect to safety of operations and equipment, labor and employment matters and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the United States are subject to regulation by state
regulatory authorities, and our international operations are regulated by the countries in which they operate and by extra-territorial laws. We and our employees are subject to various U.S. federal,
state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations, including many related to consumer protection. Most states in which we operate have licensing laws covering the
monitored security services industry and the construction industry. Our ADT Worldwide segment relies heavily upon both wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals, and these
technologies are regulated by both the federal and state governments. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt
operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations
changed or we failed to comply, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.



We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws outside the United States.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies
and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in FCPA enforcement
activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), increased
enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We
operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental and commercial corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with
local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
Furthermore, we are subject to investigations by the DOJ and the SEC related to allegations that improper payments have been made by our subsidiaries and agents in recent years in violation of the
FCPA. We have continued to report to
the DOJ and the SEC the remedial measures that we have taken in response to the allegations and our own internal investigations. In 2005, we informed the DOJ and the SEC that we had retained outside
counsel to perform a Company-wide baseline review of our policies, controls and practices with respect to the FCPA. The baseline review, which has been completed, has revealed that some business
practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements. In February 2010, we initiated discussions with the DOJ and SEC aimed at resolving these matters. Active discussions are ongoing;
however, the timing for ultimately reaching resolution as well as the outcome of this matter remains uncertain. In connection with the resolution of these matters, it is possible that we will be
required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other civil or criminal penalties or adverse impacts, including
being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants or a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows,
business prospects or the market value of our stock.

Our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us.

Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Certain of
the products we manufacture are "dual use" products, which are products that may have both civil and military applications, and are often subject to more stringent export controls. From time to time,
we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports. Our policy mandates strict compliance with U.S. and international trade laws. When we receive
information alleging improper activity, our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities.
Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate U.S. and/or foreign laws. Such improper actions could subject the
Company to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and our business
prospects.

We continue to be responsible for a portion of our contingent and other corporate liabilities following the Separation, primarily those relating to pre-Separation income tax
liabilities.

Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement and other agreements entered in connection with the
Separation, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Covidien and Tyco Electronics have agreed to assume and be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of
certain of our contingent and other corporate liabilities. All



costs
and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities
primarily relate to pre-Separation income tax liabilities. Liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies are not allocated.

If
any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally
with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations
related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities including associated costs and expenses.

We are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install, including claims arising from exposure to asbestos. These claims could result in
significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability.

We face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In
addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products, which could result in significant unexpected costs. We have been named in a significant
number of lawsuits alleging damages based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos through the past distribution of asbestos-containing industrial products. Any insurance we maintain may
not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition, we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected. The nature of the services
we provide exposes us to
the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. In an attempt to reduce this risk, our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions
limiting our liability in such circumstances. We cannot assure you, however, that these limitations will be enforced. Losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other
things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

We
cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise
sanctioned by regulators.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.

We
have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where we and others
disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we



reimburse
the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing
facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including:

•

solvent, metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and

•

oil spill equipment upgrades and replacement.

These
projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold
by us.

The
ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Based upon our experience, current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws, we concluded that it is probable
that we would incur remedial costs of approximately $27 million to $85 million as of September 24, 2010. As of September 24, 2010, we concluded that the best estimate
within this range is approximately $34 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $16 million is included in other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 24, 2010. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future
capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety
laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. We may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business
activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware.

Risks Related to Our Liquidity

Disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us, our customers and our suppliers, as access to liquidity may be negatively impacted by disruptions in
the credit markets, leading to increased funding costs or unavailability of credit.

In the normal course of our business, we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of
indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in the Company's subsidiaries. Although we believe we have sufficient
liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs, our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets. In 2009 and 2010, credit markets experienced
significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions, and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable. These factors may make it more
difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective
customers to commence new projects, as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. Disruptions in the financial markets have
had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slow down in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses. These disruptions may have other
unknown adverse affects. Based on these conditions, our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected.



Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants, including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and
sale/leaseback transactions.

Although
we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot
provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of default
under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to
extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other
indebtedness. Furthermore, acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations, which could
have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our
outstanding indebtedness.

We estimate that our available cash, our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our revolving lines of credit will
be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. However, material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar
contingencies could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we
need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Such
an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, including dividend payments;

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;
and

•

increase the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.

We share responsibility for certain of our, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including June 29, 2007.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share responsibility for certain of our, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities
that result in cash payments, based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, we, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%,
respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities



to
our, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns, certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or
similar adjustments, and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax
liabilities will generally be shared equally among the parties. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition,
Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In connection with the execution of the Tax Sharing
Agreement, we established receivables from Covidien and Tyco Electronics representing the amount we expected to receive for pre-Separation uncertain tax positions. We also established liabilities
representing the fair market value of our share of their estimated obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. As of September 24, 2010, we had recorded $89 million in other assets and
$25 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets representing the receivables from Covidien and Tyco Electronics. We had also recorded $398 million in other liabilities and
$156 million in accrued and other current liabilities representing our estimated obligations to Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would
be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an
income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional
tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of our, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' tax liabilities.

Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these
examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular, with respect to tax years preceding the Separation. We
are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the IRS, a few significant items are
expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items, which primarily involve the
treatment of certain intercompany transactions during the period, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, we may be required to litigate these matters. The calculation of our tax liabilities
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. These tax
liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We have assessed our obligations under the Tax Sharing
Agreement and determined that the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement. However, such amount could differ materially from amounts that are
actually determined to be due, and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



If the distribution of Covidien and Tyco Electronics common shares to our shareholders or certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the Separation are
determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

We have received private letter rulings from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution of Covidien
and Tyco Electronics common shares to our shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution of such shares, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, will qualify as tax-free
under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). The private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of
the Separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the Code. The private letter rulings relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings, from Tyco,
Covidien and Tyco Electronics regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions, the IRS could determine
on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not
correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the
distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, we would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Covidien and Tyco Electronics common shares distributed
to our shareholders on June 29, 2007 over our tax basis in such common shares, but such gain, if recognized, generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, we would incur
significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the Separation should be treated as taxable
transactions.

Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation in Switzerland

Swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of Tyco's securities.

Because of differences between Swiss law and U.S state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of Swiss
companies incorporated in the U.S., it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against Tyco International based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or
state securities laws of the United States in Switzerland. As a result, in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, U.S. investors may find it
difficult to:

•

effect service within the United States upon Tyco or its directors and officers located outside the United States;

•

enforce judgments obtained against those persons in U.S. courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States;
and

•

enforce against those persons in Switzerland, whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments
of U.S. courts, civil liabilities based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws.

Switzerland
and the United States do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The recognition and
enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the United States in Switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law. This statute provides in
principle that a judgment rendered by a non-Swiss court may be enforced in Switzerland only if:

•

the foreign court had jurisdiction pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law;

•

the judgment of such foreign court has become final and non-appealable;

•

the judgment does not contravene Swiss public policy;



•

the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law;
and

•

no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in Switzerland, or adjudicated in
Switzerland, or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in Switzerland.

As a result of our change of domicile from Bermuda to Switzerland and the increase in the par value of our shares, we may have less flexibility with respect to certain
aspects of capital management.

In connection with our change of domicile from Bermuda to Switzerland, we significantly increased the par value of our shares.
Currently the par value of our shares is CHF 7.16 (or approximately $7.41 based on the exchange rate in effect on November 8, 2010). Under Swiss law, we generally may not issue
registered shares for an amount below par value. As of November 8, 2010 the closing price of our ordinary shares on the NYSE was $39.11. In the event there is a need to raise common equity
capital at a time when the trading price of our registered shares is below our par value, we would need to obtain approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our registered shares. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval in a timely manner. Obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and
convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans. If we were to receive shareholder approval to reduce the par value of our registered shares, the reduction would
decrease our ability to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital, which may subject you to Swiss withholding tax.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

Our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world aggregating approximately 35 million square feet of floor space,
of which approximately 15 million square feet are owned and approximately 20 million square feet are leased. These facilities house manufacturing, distribution and warehousing operations, as
well as sales and marketing, engineering and administrative offices.

ADT
Worldwide operates through a network of offices and service facilities located in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and
South Africa. The group occupies approximately 7 million square feet, of which 1 million square feet are owned and 6 million square feet are leased.

In
the opinion of management, our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing
leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. See Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our lease obligations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

As previously disclosed, the Company and certain of its officers and directors were subject to a number of lawsuits alleging violations
of federal and state securities laws and related claims. Since June 2007, the Company has resolved substantially all of these claims, although a number of matters have not reached final
resolution. The most significant of these is the previously disclosed settlement for $79 million of the

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd.

matter

,

a class action lawsuit arising from Tyco's July 2000 initial public offering of common stock of TyCom Ltd. The settlement received final
court approval on August 25, 2010 from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, although certain contingencies for the matter will remain outstanding until the end of
calendar year 2010. The settlement is subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Covidien and Tyco Electronics. The Company believes its remaining
reserve related to legacy securities matters is sufficient to satisfy the final resolution of this matter.

Tyco
is also a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management, among which are affirmative cases brought by Tyco against Mr. Dennis L. Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief
executive officer, Mr. Mark Swartz, its former chief financial officer, and Mr. Frank Walsh Jr., a former director. In connection with these affirmative actions, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz are
seeking an aggregate of approximately $128 million allegedly due in connection with their compensation and retention arrangements and under ERISA, and Mr. Walsh has made claims alleging that
Tyco is required to indemnify him for his defense costs and settlement amounts paid by him in connection with securities lawsuits and arising from his role as a Tyco director. Tyco intends to
vigorously defend each of these actions. In October 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Tyco's affirmative claims against Mr. Walsh. Tyco intends to
appeal this decision. Mr. Walsh's claims for indemnification against Tyco remain outstanding.

Tyco
has reserved its best estimate of probable loss for these matters, and although their ultimate resolution could differ materially from these estimates, it does not believe any such
resolution would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative
cleanup methods. As of September 24, 2010, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $27 million to $85 million. As of
September 24, 2010, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $34 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities
and $16 million is included in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company
believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos Matters

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits
based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial
products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with



asbestos-containing
components manufactured by third-parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. While the Company has observed an increase in the number of
these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a
result, have been dismissed by the courts. The Company's strategy has been, and continues to be, to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate,
settling suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, the Company cannot predict the extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the
future. Of the lawsuits that have proceeded to trial since 2005, the Company has won or settled all but one case, with that one case returning an adverse jury verdict for approximately
$7.7 million, which included both compensatory and punitive damages. The Company recently settled the matter while its appeal was pending for significantly less than the amount awarded by the
jury. As of September 24, 2010, there were approximately 3,500 lawsuits pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. Each lawsuit typically includes several claims, and the Company has
determined that there were approximately 4,700 claims outstanding as of September 24, 2010, which amount reflects the Company's current estimate of the number of active claims made against it
or its affiliates, and includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted, identify incorrect defendants or are duplicative of other actions.

For
a detailed discussion of asbestos-related matters, see Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Tax Matters

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these
examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular, with respect to tax years preceding the Separation. We are reviewing and contesting
certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the IRS, a few significant items are expected to remain open with
respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain
intercompany transactions during the period, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, we may be required to litigate these matters. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated
tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected
net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We have assessed our obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement and determined that
the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement. However, such amount could differ materially from amounts that are actually determined to be due,
and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

For
a detailed discussion of income tax matters and audits, see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, the Company has received and responded to various allegations and other
information that certain improper payments were made by the Company's subsidiaries and agents in recent years. For example, two subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business in Italy have been
charged, along with numerous other parties, in connection with the Milan public prosecutor's investigation into allegedly improper payments made to certain Italian entities, and the Company has
reported to German authorities potentially improper conduct



involving
agents retained by the Company's EMEA water business. The Company has since resolved this matter with German authorities while the Italian matter remains outstanding. The Company reported to
the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to these and other allegations and its internal investigations. In 2005,
the Company informed the DOJ and the SEC that it retained outside counsel to perform a Company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. The Company has and will continue to communicate with the DOJ and SEC to
provide updates on the baseline review and follow-up investigations, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper conduct identified by the Company in the
course of its ongoing compliance activities. The baseline review, which has been completed, has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements, and in
February 2010, the Company initiated discussions with the DOJ and SEC aimed at resolving these matters. Active discussions remain ongoing, and the Company cannot predict the timing of their
resolution or their outcome and cannot estimate the range of potential loss or the form of penalty that may result from an adverse resolution. It is possible that the Company may be required to pay
material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including being subject to
lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Covidien
and Tyco Electronics agreed, in connection with the Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its responses regarding these matters. Any judgment required to be paid or
settlement or other cost incurred by the Company in connection with the FCPA investigations matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement,
which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics businesses of the Company to Covidien and Tyco Electronics, respectively, and provides that the Company will
retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations. Any liabilities not primarily related to a particular segment will be shared equally among the Company, Covidien and Tyco
Electronics.

As
previously disclosed, in early 2007 certain former subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business were charged by the German Federal Cartel Office ("FCO") with engaging in
anti-competitive
practices, in particular with regard to its hydrant, valve, street box and fittings business. The Company investigated this matter and determined that the conduct may have violated German anti-trust
law. The Company is cooperating with the FCO in its ongoing investigation of this violation. The Company cannot estimate the range of potential loss that may result from this violation. It is possible
that the Company may be subject to civil or criminal proceedings and may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic
Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund (the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the Fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan such as the Fund, the
employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between Grinnell Fire
Protection Systems, SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669.

ERISA
requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan. A plan's assessment of
withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration, and ERISA requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration. If the employer
prevails in



arbitration
(and any subsequent appeals), its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest. The Fund's total withdrawal liability assessment against SimplexGrinnell is
approximately $25 million. The quarterly withdrawal liability payments are $1.1 million, $14.3 million of which has been cumulatively paid through September 24, 2010. While
the ultimate outcome is uncertain, SimplexGrinnell believes that it has strong arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the Fund, and it plans to vigorously defend against the Fund's
withdrawal liability assessment. The matter is currently in arbitration. The Company has made no provision for this contingency and believes that its quarterly payments are recoverable.

Broadview Security Contingency

On May 14, 2010, the Company acquired Broadview Security, which is a business that was formerly owned by The Brink's Company.
Under the Coal Industry Retiree Health
Benefit Act of 1992, as amended (the "Coal Act"), The Brink's Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries at July 20, 1992 (including certain legal entities acquired in the Broadview Security
acquisition) are jointly and severally liable with certain of The Brink's Company's other current and former subsidiaries for health care coverage obligations provided for by the Coal Act. A Voluntary
Employees' Beneficiary Associate ("VEBA") trust has been established by The Brink's Company to pay for these liabilities, although the trust may have insufficient funds to satisfy all future
obligations. At the time of its spin-off from The Brink's Company, Broadview Security entered into an agreement in which The Brink's Company agreed to indemnify Broadview Security for any and all
liabilities and expenses related to The Brink's Company's former coal operations, including any health care coverage obligations. The Brink's Company has agreed that this indemnification survives the
Company's acquisition of Broadview Security. The Company has evaluated its potential liability under the Coal Act as a contingency in light of all known facts, including the funding of the VEBA, and
indemnification provided by The Brinks Company. The Company has concluded that no accrual is necessary due to the existence of the indemnification and its belief that The Brink's Company and the VEBA
will be able to satisfy all future obligations under the Coal Act.

Other Matters

As previously reported, in 2002, the SEC's Division of Enforcement conducted an investigation related to past accounting practices for
dealer connect fees that ADT had charged to its authorized dealers upon purchasing customer accounts. The investigation related to accounting practices employed by the Company's former management,
which were discontinued in 2003. Although the Company settled with the SEC in 2006, a number of former dealers and related parties have filed lawsuits against the Company, including a class action
lawsuit filed in the District Court of Arapahoe County, Colorado, alleging breach of contract and other claims related to ADT's decision to terminate certain authorized dealers in 2002 and 2003. In
February 2010, the Court granted a directed verdict in ADT's favor dismissing a number of the plaintiffs' key claims. The plaintiffs have appealed this verdict. While it is not possible at this
time to predict the final outcome of these lawsuits, the Company does not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In
addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and product and general liability claims, incidental to
present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. With respect to many of these claims, the Company either self-insures or maintains insurance through third-parties, with varying
deductibles. While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of any such proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered
by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows beyond amounts recorded for such matters.



PART II

Item 5.    Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The number of registered holders of Tyco's common shares as of November 5, 2010 was 26,561.

Tyco
common shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "TYC." The following table sets forth the high and low closing sales prices of Tyco
common shares as reported by the NYSE, and the dividends declared on Tyco common shares, for the quarterly periods presented below. Effective March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of
incorporation from
Bermuda to the Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland. In connection with the change of domicile, the par value of Tyco's common shares increased from $0.80 per share to 8.53 Swiss francs (CHF) per share
(or $7.21 based on the exchange rate in effect on March 17, 2009). The Change of Domicile was approved at a special general meeting of shareholders held on March 12, 2009. The following
steps occurred in connection with the Change of Domicile, which did not result in a change to total shareholders' equity:

(1)

approximately
21 million shares held directly or indirectly in treasury were cancelled;

(2)

the
par value of common shares was increased from $0.80 to CHF 8.53 through an approximate 1-for-9 reverse share split, followed by the issuance of
approximately eight fully paid up shares so that the same number of shares were outstanding before and after the Change of Domicile, which reduced share premium and increased common shares; and

(3)

the
remaining amount of share premium was eliminated with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus.

The
dividends declared in 2010 and the second through fourth quarters of 2009 are the U.S. dollar equivalent of Swiss francs converted at the
U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate shortly before the payment dates. As a Swiss company, dividends paid by Tyco are subject to shareholder approval. Shareholders approved annual dividends of
CHF 0.93 and CHF 0.90 at the shareholder meetings held on March 12, 2009 and March 11, 2010, respectively. At the time of approval, the equivalent U.S. dollar amount of
these dividends were $0.80 and $0.84, respectively.

Dividend Policy

Pursuant to Swiss law, dividend payments made prior to January 1, 2011 are subject to Swiss withholding taxes unless made in the
form of a return of capital from our registered share capital. As a result, we have paid dividends in the form of a reduction of registered share capital, denominated in Swiss francs since
March 2009. Notwithstanding the Swiss denomination of annual dividends we have made payments of dividends in U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date.
Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid increase or decrease the U.S. dollar amount required to be paid. We have
managed the variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk. Our last dividend



expected
to be paid out of registered share capital is scheduled to be paid in February 2011. After this payment, we expect to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction in contributed
surplus, which are also expected to be made free of Swiss withholding taxes, but can be denominated and paid in U.S. dollars, removing the exposure to currency fluctuations for recipients of the
dividend. We expect to obtain shareholder approval of the annual dividend amount out of contributed surplus each year at our annual general meeting, and we expect to distribute the approved dividend
amount in four quarterly installments, the timing of which will be determined by our Board of Directors. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will
depend upon many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other relevant factors. Future dividends
will be proposed by our Board of Directors and, as stated above, require shareholder approval.

The
Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan ("Plan") provides for the award of stock options, restricted shares and other
equity and equity-based awards to Board members, officers and non-officer employees. Amount shown under number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options includes 205,044 deferred
stock unit ("DSU") grants and dividend equivalents earned on each DSU account, 19,725,390 shares to be issued upon exercise of options, 3,671,026 restricted stock units and 1,729,152 performance share
units representing target payout. There are currently no restricted share awards outstanding under this plan. Amount shown under shares available reflects the aggregate shares available under Tyco
International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), LTIP II and the 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan. Shares available under LTIP and LTIP II in March 2004 were rolled into the 2004 Stock and
Incentive Plan as of the inception of the Plan.

(2)

The
LTIP allows for the grant of stock options and other equity or equity-based grants to Board members, officers and non-officer employees.
Amount shown under number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options includes 2,864,247 shares to be issued upon exercise of options, including 20,137 assumed in connection with
acquisitions with a weighted-average exercise price of $61.09 and 868,359 DSU grants and dividend equivalents earned on each DSU account. No additional options may be granted under those assumed
plans. Effective as of inception of the 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan, no additional grants may be made under the LTIP or the LTIP II.

(3)

Shares
available for future issuance under the Tyco Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which represents the number of remaining shares
registered for issuance under this plan. All of the shares delivered to participants under the ESPP were purchased in the open market. The ESPP was suspended indefinitely during the fourth quarter of
2009.

(4)

Under
the terms of the 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan adopted in March 2004, no additional options, equity or equity-based grants will
be made to Board members, officers and non-officer employees under the LTIP or the LTIP II. LTIP II allowed for the grant of stock options and other equity or equity-based grants to employees who are
not officers of Tyco. Under this plan, non-officer employees or former employees of Tyco or a subsidiary could receive: (i) options to purchase Tyco common shares; (ii) stock
appreciation rights; (iii) awards payable in cash, common shares, other securities or other property, based on the achievement of performance goals; (iv) dividend equivalents, consisting
of a right to receive payments equivalent to dividends declared on Tyco common shares; and (v) other stock-based awards as determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee
("Committee"). The exercise price of options and stock appreciation rights would generally be fair market value on the date of grant, but could be lower in certain circumstances. No individual could
receive awards for more than 12,000,000 shares (or 3,000,000 shares on a post-reverse stock split basis) in any



calendar
year. Terms and conditions of awards were determined by the Committee. Awards could be deferred, and could be payable in any form the Committee determined, including cash, Tyco common shares,
other securities or other property. The Committee may modify awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events, including a change of control. The shares granted under the LTIP II will be issued
at vesting under the 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan.

The
Tyco International Ltd. United Kingdom ("UK") Savings Related Share Option Plan ("SAYE") is a UK Inland Revenue approved plan for UK
employees pursuant to which employees were granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at a 15% discount off of the market price at time of grant. Employees made monthly
contributions that were, at the election of the employee, used for the purchase price of shares or the contribution could have been returned to the employee. The total amount of shares that may have
been purchased at the end of the three years of service was equal to the total of the monthly contributions, plus a tax-free bonus amount equal to a multiple of the aggregate amount of monthly
contributions, divided by the option price. An option will generally be exercisable only during the period of six months following the three-year period. The plan was administered by the Company's
International Benefits Oversight Committee, appointed by the Committee. The International Benefits Oversight Committee, among other things, determined when to grant options and set the option price.
The SAYE Plan was approved on November 3, 1999 for a ten year period and has expired according to its terms on November 3, 2009. The International Benefits Oversight Committee has not
approved any additional grants since the last annual grant on October 9, 2008 and it has not applied for approval of a replacement for the SAYE Plan at this time.

The transactions described in the table above represent the repurchase of common shares on the NYSE as part of the $1.0 billion share
repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July 2008 ("2008 Share Repurchase Program"). The average price paid per share is calculated by dividing the total cash paid for the
shares by the total number of shares repurchased. The Company has substantially completed the 2008 Share Repurchase Program. On September 8, 2010, the Board of
Directors approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program ("2010 Share Repurchase Program"). Less than $1 million and $1 billion remained outstanding under the 2008 and 2010
Share Repurchase Programs, respectively, as of September 24, 2010.



Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data of Tyco. This data is derived from Tyco's Consolidated Financial
Statements for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively. Tyco has a 52 or
53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday in September. Fiscal years 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were all 52-week years. Fiscal 2011 will be a 53-week year which will end on
September 30, 2011.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell our European water business. The business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and
therefore has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented below. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly our
Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively. These businesses are classified as discontinued operations in fiscal 2007 and 2006. Net income (loss) attributable to Tyco common shareholders for
2007 and 2006 includes income (loss) from discontinued operations of $814 million and $2.8 billion, respectively, primarily related to the Healthcare and Electronics businesses. This
selected financial data should be read in conjunction with Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report as well as the section of this Annual
Report titled Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the
Selected Financial Data and our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The Company does not believe that its historical operating results will be indicative of future
operating results. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Introduction

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws
of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD"), in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

The
Company operates in the following business segments:

•

ADT Worldwide

designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic
security systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. In addition, ADT Worldwide manufactures certain products related to retailer anti-theft systems.

•

Flow Control

designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes,
fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for general process, energy and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater markets.

•

Fire Protection Services

designs, sells, installs and services fire
detection and fire suppression systems for commercial, industrial and governmental customers.

•

Electrical and Metal Products

designs, manufactures and sells galvanized
steel tubing, armored wire and cable and other metal products for non-residential construction, electrical, fire and safety and mechanical customers.

•

Safety Products

designs, manufactures and sells fire suppression,
electronic security and life safety products, including fire sprinklers, breathing apparatus, intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products
manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services.

We
also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other.

References
to the segment data are to the Company's continuing operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. The
Company has reclassified certain businesses which have satisfied the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations to income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and assets and liabilities held for sale within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the Company has realigned certain
business operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 resulting in prior period segment amounts being recast. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On
May 14, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS" or "Broadview Security") in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at
approximately



$2.0 billion,
with $585 million in cash being used to fund the acquisition. Broadview Security is being integrated into the Company's ADT Worldwide segment. Broadview Security's core
business is to provide security alarm monitoring services for residential and commercial properties in North America. It has a large residential recurring customer base, which has enhanced ADT's
presence in the North American residential security business. Broadview Security is also a leader in technologies and services which are expected to enhance ADT Worldwide's service offerings to its
customers. In connection with the integration of Broadview Security into the ADT Worldwide segment, the Broadview Security brand has been discontinued, and we expect to realize cost savings and other
synergies through operational efficiencies including consolidation of both marketing and general and administrative functions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we initiated a program to fully
integrate Broadview Security into our ADT Worldwide segment. We anticipate that Broadview Security will be fully integrated into our ADT Worldwide segment's North America business during the first
half of 2011. As a result, Broadview Security's operating results, including its revenue and income from continuing operations, will be reflected in the operating results of our ADT North America
business and will no longer be reported separately.

Due
to the integration of operations, we have estimated that Broadview Security contributed approximately $193 million to our consolidated net revenue and a loss from continuing
operations of $25 million during 2010. We incurred approximately $17 million of costs directly related to the
acquisition and $18 million of integration costs for a total of $35 million during 2010. Of this amount, $32 million has been recorded in our ADT Worldwide segment and $3 million in
Corporate and Other. Both acquisition and integration costs have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010. In addition,
our ADT Worldwide segment recorded $14 million of restructuring expenses related to combining the Broadview Security and ADT Worldwide businesses, which have been recorded within restructuring,
asset impairments and divestiture charges, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010.

Also,
during the third quarter of 2010, we announced our intention to pursue a tax-free spin-off of our Electrical and Metal Products business. On November 9, 2010, we announced
an agreement to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. In connection with this announcement, we no longer plan to pursue the tax-free spin-off of
our Electrical and Metal Products business as proposed on April 27, 2010. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Overview

Net revenue for 2010 increased $134 million, or 0.8%, as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable
impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $624 million, or 3.7%. This increase was partially offset by net revenue declines experienced in our Flow Control and Fire Protection
Services segments. Flow Control's decline in net revenue was primarily the result of reduced volume in its valves business driven by decreased demand in our end markets. Weakness in the commercial end
market resulted in a decline in product and systems installation revenue within our Fire Protection Services segment.

Service
revenue continued to grow as a percentage of our overall revenue to 41% for 2010 as compared to 40% and 36% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our service revenues are principally
derived from our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services businesses, and represent a predictable and consistent source of revenue. Recurring revenue in our ADT Worldwide business represents
approximately 58% of ADT's total revenue compared to approximately 54% in 2009 and 51% in 2008. Recurring revenue represents revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under
contractual arrangements. In the Fire Protection Services business, service revenue continued to increase as a percentage of Fire Protection's total revenue to 52% in 2010, as compared to 49% and 48%
in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by approximately



$69 million,
or 0.4%, for net acquisitions and divestitures, which primarily related to the acquisition of Broadview Security partially offset by the sale of our French security business.

Operating
income during 2010 was $1.6 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1.5 billion during 2009. Operating income in 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill and
intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $2.7 billion and legacy legal settlement charges of approximately $125 million during 2009. Operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted
by efficiencies gained from cost containment actions taken in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and restructuring actions taken in prior years. Restructuring and asset impairment charges decreased to
$145 million during 2010 from $232 million during 2009. Operating income during 2010 was favorably impacted by net gains on divestitures of $40 million as compared to a loss on
divestitures of $15 million during 2009. We also incurred acquisition and integration charges of $35 million during 2010 related to our acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in
foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $80 million during 2010.

As
of September 24, 2010, our cash balance was $1.8 billion, as compared to $2.4 billion as of September 25, 2009. We generated approximately
$2.6 billion of cash from operating activities, which was more than offset by: $600 million of cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired, primarily related to our acquisition of
Broadview Security; accounts purchased by ADT and capital expenditures of $1.3 billion; approximately $900 million to repurchase our common shares; dividends paid of $416 million;
and a net debt repayment of $204 million. We expect to continue to use our cash to fund internal growth opportunities, improve productivity across all of our businesses, make acquisitions that
strategically fit within our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Flow Control businesses and return capital to shareholders. On September 8, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new
$1.0 billion share repurchase program ("2010 repurchase program") as the remaining capacity under our existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program was substantially utilized by the end
of August 2010. We did not repurchase any shares under the new program during 2010.

In
2010, we also continued our portfolio refinement efforts by exiting areas that have not provided, and are not expected to provide, an adequate return on investment and by taking
advantage of restructuring opportunities that are expected to provide future cost savings. During 2010, we incurred approximately $145 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges,
substantially completing our 2009 restructuring program. During fiscal 2010, we identified additional opportunities for cost savings through restructuring activities in fiscal 2011. We expect to incur
restructuring and restructuring related charges of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2011.

Over
the last few years, we have explored alternatives for under-performing or non-strategic businesses, including divestiture. We sold our French security business, which was part of
our ADT Worldwide segment, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $53 million during 2010. The gain and results of operations of the French security business are presented in continuing operations as
the criteria for discontinued operations have not been met. As discussed above, during the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced our intention to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal
Products business. See Notes 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our European
water business, which is part of our Flow Control segment. The business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods
presented. On September 30, 2010, we received the necessary consents and approval to complete the sale of this business and received net cash proceeds of approximately $267 million. We
expect to recognize a gain on the transaction.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels has been
classified as revenue from product sales during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, the sale of the electronic tags and labels was misclassified as service revenue. The service revenue and
revenue from product sales during fiscal 2009 and 2008 have not been changed for this misclassification, as the effect is not material. The impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2009 would have
been to decrease service revenue by $286 million, with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales. The impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2008 would have been to decrease
service revenue by $364 million, with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales.

(2)

Certain
operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful.



Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other life safety systems as well as products related to
retailer anti-theft systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well
as other security services.

Net
revenue for ADT Worldwide increased $310 million, or 4.4%, during 2010, as compared to 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
of $218 million, or 3.1%. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $72 million, or 1.0%, which was primarily the result of
$193 million in net revenue estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition partially offset by $109 million of divested revenue relating to our French security business.
Approximately 58% and 54% of ADT Worldwide's total net revenue during 2010 and 2009, respectively, represents revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contractual
arrangements, which is considered recurring revenue. Recurring revenue increased by $435 million, or 11.3%, to approximately $4.3 billion as a result of growth in customer accounts of
approximately 1.5 million, or 20.5%, to a total of approximately 8.9 million accounts as of September 24, 2010. Approximately 1.4 million customer accounts were acquired on
May 14, 2010 in connection with the Broadview Security acquisition and approximately 501,000 customer accounts were acquired through the ADT dealer program during 2010. The net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted recurring revenue by $148 million in 2010, or 3.8%, and $116 million, or 3.0%,
respectively. Systems installation, product sales and other service revenue declined by $125 million, or 3.9%, to approximately $3.1 billion due to lower sales volume primarily as the
result of continued weakness in the commercial end market, which has declined at a slower rate than the same period in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted
systems installation, product sales and other service revenue by $102 million, or 3.2%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in an unfavorable impact of
$76 million, or 2.4%.

Net
revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was as follows ($

Geographically, North America net revenue increased $251 million, or 6.0%, during 2010 primarily as the result of the net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures, which favorably impacted net revenue by an estimated $193 million, or 4.6%, as the result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Partially offsetting this
increase was a decline in systems installation and product sales as the result of continued weakness in the commercial market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior
year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $48 million, or 1.1%. Net revenue in EMEA decreased $137 million, or 7.3%, as favorable changes in
foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.2%, were more than offset by a decline in systems installation and other service revenue as a result of continued weakness in the commercial
end market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Additionally, EMEA net revenue was unfavorably impacted by $121 million, or 6.5%, due to the impact
of divestitures. Net revenue increased $196 million, or 19.4%, in the Rest of World geographies primarily due to recurring revenue growth in both Latin American and Asia Pacific regions as ADT
Worldwide continues to focus on building its customer account and recurring revenue base in these markets. The Asia-Pacific region experienced an increase in system installation, products sales and
other service revenue which was



partially
offset by a decrease in the Latin American region due to the continued slowdown in commercial and retailer end markets. Net revenue in the Rest of World geographies was also favorably
impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $110 million, or 10.9%.

Attrition
rates for the years ended September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 have been recast to reflect the divestiture of
our French security business, which resulted in reductions of 0.1% in the amounts previously reported for September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively.

Operating income increased by approximately $1.3 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income for 2009 was negatively affected
by goodwill impairment charges of $959 million recorded at our ADT EMEA and Sensormatic Retail Solutions reporting units and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million. Operating income
in 2010 was positively impacted by the shift to higher margin recurring revenue. Additionally, 2010 operating income was favorably impacted by the net impact of savings realized through previous
restructuring actions, savings realized through cost containment actions, and a curtailment gain of $12 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United
Kingdom. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of intangible assets primarily relating to the Broadview Security acquisition. During 2010, $60 million of net
restructuring charges were incurred, of which $14 million related to restructuring actions associated with the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to $103 million of restructuring
charges, net during 2009. Fiscal year 2010 also included a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business, and $32 million of
acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to a $6 loss and nil of divestiture and acquisition costs, respectively, during 2009. Changes in foreign
currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $30 million.

Net
revenue for ADT Worldwide decreased $736 million, or 9.4%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates of $614 million. Revenue was positively affected by $152 million for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue from product sales decreased 16.8%
and service revenue decreased 5.5%. Recurring revenue declined 3.5% during 2009 primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted recurring revenue by
7.5%, but was offset by growth in North America and Asia. Product sales and installation and other service revenue declined 15.6% partially due to a result of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, which unfavorably impacted system installation and service revenue by 8.3%, and lower sales volume due to weakness in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Geographically,
revenue in North America decreased $46 million, or 1.1%, resulting from reduced spending primarily in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue in EMEA decreased
$528 million, or 22.0%, largely as a result of foreign currency exchange rates, which had an unfavorable impact of $328 million. The remaining decrease in EMEA was primarily a result of
a decline in product sales, systems installation and service revenue due to a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue declined $162 million, or 13.8%, in
the Rest of World geographies, which was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $223 million partially offset by growth in Asia and Latin
America.

Operating
income in 2009 decreased $1.1 billion as compared to 2008. Based on the deterioration in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market discussed above, the
Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $959 million related to its ADT EMEA reporting unit and intangible



asset
impairment charges of $64 million related to certain franchise rights within North America during the second quarter of 2009. The decrease is also related to the unfavorable impact of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $45 million. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the
weakness experienced in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market, and adverse global economic conditions. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment
and divestiture charges of $109 million in 2009. Operating income in 2008 included restructuring charges of $119 million and expenses of $51 million primarily to convert customers
from analog to digital signal transmission in North America. There were no charges related to converting customers to digital signal during 2009. The decline in operating income was partially offset
by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions.

Net
revenue for Flow Control decreased $122 million, or 3.5%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by reduced volume in the valves
business driven by decreased demand in our end markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $218 million, or 6.2%, as well as the net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures by $10 million, or 0.3%.

The
decrease in operating income of $86 million, or 17.3%, during 2010 as compared to 2009, was primarily due to decreased volume in our valves business and an expected loss
related to completion of a long-term construction project of approximately $18 million. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of
$31 million, or 6.3%. The decline in operating income was also partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Operating income was negatively impacted
by $24 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net during both 2010 and 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $5 million of additional charges resulting from
restructuring actions were incurred during 2009.

Net
revenue for Flow Control decreased $457 million, or 11.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $418 million, or 10.6%. Revenue also decreased due to reduced volume in the water business and reduced project activity in the energy end market of the
thermal controls business. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the valves business primarily from the energy end market in EMEA. The net impact of acquisitions and
divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million in 2009 and favorably impacted net revenue by $16 million in 2008.

Operating
income decreased $78 million, or 13.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates of $71 million as well as decreased volume in the water businesses discussed above offset by margin improvements in the valves business. Margins were also
negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $24 million. Additionally, management



estimates
that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $6 million in
2008. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses during 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America.
The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions.

Net revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $55 million, or 1.6%, during 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily due to
continued weakness in commercial markets and a shift from lower margin projects to higher projects, which more than offset the favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of
$118 million, or 3.5%. Geographically, net revenue in North America decreased $54 million, or 2.7%, primarily due to the continued decline in systems installation and upgrade activity in
the sprinkler business. Reduced systems installation and upgrade activity in the electronic business as well as service revenue in the sprinkler and suppression businesses also contributed to the
decrease, although to a much lesser extent. These declines were partially offset by an increase in service revenue in the electronic business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably
impacted revenue in North America by $28 million, or 1.4%. Although net revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $1 million, changes in foreign currency exchange rates
favorably impacted net revenue by $90 million, or 6.4%, which was almost entirely offset by a decrease in revenue due to continued weakness in the European commercial markets. The net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted revenue by $6 million, or 0.2%.

Operating
income increased $202 million during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income during 2009 was negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of
$180 million recorded at the EMEA Fire reporting unit. Additionally, operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by savings



realized
through cost containment actions, and to a lesser extent, a curtailment gain of approximately $7 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United
Kingdom. During 2010, $34 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net were incurred as compared to $45 million of restructuring charges during 2009. Changes in foreign currency
exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $11 million. The net increase in operating income was partially offset by the decreased sales volume discussed above.

Net
revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $403 million, or 10.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable changes in
foreign currency exchange rates of $293 million, or 7.7%. Additionally, revenue declined due to the weakness in the commercial market and adverse global economic conditions. Geographically,
revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $286 million, or 16.8%, largely due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates discussed above as well as
weakness in the European commercial markets. Additionally, revenue in our North America SimplexGrinnell business decreased by $117 million, 5.5%, primarily due to a decline in systems
installation and upgrade activity in the sprinkler business.

Operating
income decreased $263 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $180 million goodwill impairment in EMEA recorded during 2009
compared to a $9 million goodwill impairment in Latin America recorded during 2008. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume discussed above as well as an increase in bad
debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets and adverse global economic conditions. There were restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of
$45 million in 2009 as compared to $26 million in 2008. Additionally, operating income decreased due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of
$10 million. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions.

Certain
operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful.

Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $7 million, or 0.5%, during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in revenue was
primarily due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million, or 2.7%, and $24 million, or 1.7%; due to the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
These increases were partially offset by a decline in volume of armored cable products and, to a lesser extent, steel products. Higher selling prices for armored cable products were almost entirely
offset by lower selling prices for steel products.

Operating
income increased approximately $1.0 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income for 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of
$935 million



recorded
at the Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit. Also contributing to the increase in operating income were higher spreads for steel products resulting from lower raw material costs which
more than offset lower selling prices. These increases in operating income were partially offset by lower volumes as well as higher raw material costs which more than offset higher selling prices for
armor cable products. During 2010, $13 million of restructuring charges were incurred compared to $21 million of restructuring and divestiture charges during 2009. Additionally,
$1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009 as compared to no additional charges during 2010.

Net
revenue for Electrical and Metal Products decreased $880 million, or 38.7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower volume and selling
prices of steel products largely resulting from a decline in the commercial market in North America. Lower volume and selling prices for armored cable products also contributed to the decline. Changes
in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $52 million, or 2.3%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected revenue by approximately
$31 million, or 1.4%.

Operating
income decreased $1.3 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. Based on the sales volume decrease as well as the significant decline in the price of steel, the Company
recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $935 million during the second quarter of 2009. There was no goodwill impairment recorded during 2008. The decrease in operating income also related to
volume declines as well as lower spreads for steel products. Spreads for steel products continued to decline as a direct
result of higher raw material costs and lower selling prices. Lower restructuring and divestiture charges incurred in 2009 as compared to similar charges incurred in 2008 partially offset the decline
in operating income discussed above. Results for 2009 included restructuring and divestiture charges of $21 million as compared to $42 million for 2008. Additionally, management
estimates that $1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009.

Certain
operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful.

Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $6 million, or 0.4%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in net revenue is primarily
due to lower volume in our fire suppression business partially offset by higher volume experienced in our electronic security and life safety businesses. The decrease in our fire suppression business
was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The increase in our electronic security and life safety businesses was due to higher volume primarily related to the
introduction of several new products. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $33 million, or 2.2%, which was almost entirely offset by the
unfavorable impact of divestitures of $31 million, or 2.0%.



Operating income increased $588 million during 2010 compared to 2009. Operating income during 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges
of $567 million recorded at the Access Controls and Video Systems ("ACVS") and Life Safety reporting units. The increase in operating income is attributable to the increased sales volume in the
electronic security and life safety businesses and a shift in product mix to higher margin products across all businesses, which was partially offset by the fire suppression sales volume decline
discussed above and increased sales and marketing expense. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net was $12 million during 2010 as compared to $32 million of
restructuring charges during 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009 as compared to no
additional charges during 2010. Savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions also contributed to the increase in operating income. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates
favorably impacted operating income by $6 million.

Net
revenue for Safety Products decreased $370 million, or 19.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily related to reduced volume in our fire suppression
business, life safety and electronic security businesses, which were impacted by soft economic conditions. The remaining decrease was related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates of $114 million, 6.0%. The decrease in our fire suppression business was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The decrease in the life safety
business was primarily due to reduced municipal spending. The electronic security business decrease was primarily due to the slow down in the retail sector, as retail capital projects and new store
openings were canceled or delayed.

Operating
income decreased $668 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decline was primarily attributable to goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $567 million
recorded during the quarter ended March 27, 2009 as a result of the slowdown in the commercial and retail markets. As discussed above, decreased sales volume within the fire suppression, life
safety and electronic security businesses also negatively impacted operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring charges of $32 million during 2009. Additionally,
management estimates that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. The same period in the prior year included $47 million of
restructuring and asset impairment charges, net. Operating income in 2009 also decreased by $16 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income was also
negatively impacted by a charge of $8 million relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had a business that was previously classified as held
for sale been continuously classified as held and used (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Corporate and Other

Corporate expense decreased $104 million, or 18.4%, to $461 million for 2010 compared to $565 million in 2009.
Corporate expense during 2009 was negatively affected by approximately $125 million of charges related to legacy securities matters partially offset by a $16 million benefit related to a
settlement reached with a former executive. Restructuring charges decreased to $1 million for 2010 as compared to $10 million in 2009. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by
savings realized through cost containment and restructuring charges. These decreases in Corporate expenses were partially offset by a $52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the third
quarter of 2010 as compared to a $37 million net asbestos charge in 2009, both of which were recorded in conjunction with the valuation of our asbestos-related liabilities and insurance assets.
In addition, $4 million of divestiture charges, net, and $3 million of acquisition costs were recorded during the 2010 as compared to $6 million of divestiture charges, net, and
nil of acquisition costs for 2009.

Corporate
expense for 2009 was $45 million higher as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from a charge of approximately $125 million related to the settlement
of legacy securities matters, which was partially offset by $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former



executive.
Additionally, corporate expense in 2009 included $16 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of
$28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and
divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction
initiatives and the restructuring program.

Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was $31 million in 2010, as compared to $44 million and $112 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
decrease in interest income from 2009 primarily related to lower investment yields.

Interest
expense was $284 million in 2010, as compared to $301 million and $396 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is primarily
related to savings from interest rate swaps and no amounts being drawn under the revolving credit facilities in 2010, partially offset by additional interest associated with the January and
October 2009 debt issuances.

The
weighted-average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was 6.3%, 6.6% and 6.2%,
respectively.

Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net of $75 million in 2010 primarily relates to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on
the redemption of our 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 11. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of
an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6.

Other
expense, net of $7 million in 2009 primarily relates to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco
Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk
related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends.

Other
expense, net of $223 million in 2008 primarily relates to a charge of $258 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and
exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related
financial instruments. We also recorded other-than-temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate debt.
Additionally, we recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement in connection with the
adoption of the guidance pertaining to the accounting for uncertain
income taxes. We also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008.

Income Taxes

Effective Income Tax Rate

Our effective income tax rate was 10.9% for 2010. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by pre-tax income in tax jurisdictions with low
tax rates. Additionally, the 2010 tax rate was further reduced by limited tax on certain business dispositions, a release of deferred tax valuation allowances and a non-recurring item generating a tax
benefit. The effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion for which almost no tax benefit was
available. Additionally, taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased



profitability
in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the
non-U.S. deferred tax assets. Our effective income tax rate was 23.5% for 2008. Income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release
of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the non-U.S. deferred tax assets.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,379 million and $766 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and
recorded when we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income
to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether,
and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and
circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax
liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the
rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre-Separation income tax liabilities. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of
shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. Costs and expenses
associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. Consistent with the sharing provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco had a net
receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $114 million and $106 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. In addition, as of
September 24, 2010, Tyco had a recorded liability of $554 million (of which $156 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and the remaining amount in other
liabilities) representing the fair value of Tyco's obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement as of the date of the Separation. The liability was $554 million as of September 25, 2009,
which was recorded in other liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we reclassified $156 million from other liabilities to accrued and other current liabilities as we expect to make a
payment within the next twelve months to Covidien and Tyco Electronics related to resolution of certain IRS audit matters.

Tyco
and its subsidiaries' income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised
issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related
interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate.

For
a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's income taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



2009 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments

Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, we test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets with its carrying amount.

We
began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments as a result of a slowdown in the
commercial markets, including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our Electrical Metal Products segments. Although we considered and concluded that these factors did not
constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecasted results,
restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed. Reporting units within ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety
Products segments continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Additionally, our Electrical Metal Products reporting unit
continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the non-residential construction market. We determined that these underlying events and circumstances
constituted triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts. Specifically, we concluded that our
EMEA Security and EMEA Fire reporting units within the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, our Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit within the Electrical and Metal Products
segment and our ACVS, Life Safety and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Safety Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these
reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. Furthermore, we determined that certain indefinite-lived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and
circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer end market of our ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments. As a result of the
triggering events, we performed long-lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights.

Fair
value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates)
discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital of market participants. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a number of factors, including operating results,
business plans, economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery, cash flow forecasts, market data, and our overall market capitalization. Based on the factors described above,
actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting unit's products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash flows used in the second
quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the range of the weighted-average cost of
capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our products and services. The results of the goodwill impairment tests
indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. We recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $2.6
billion ($2.6 billion after-tax) during the
second quarter of 2009. The non-cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27,
2009.

Indefinite-lived
intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings
method, which include the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to
the underlying intangible assets. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, our estimates of future cash flows used in



determining
the fair value of our Safety Products segment Sensormatic tradename as well as certain ADT Worldwide segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our
tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the impairment test indicated that the Safety Products Sensormatic tradename and ADT Worldwide franchise rights estimated fair values were less
than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, we recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after-tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The
non-cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to use judgment in making
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following
accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant
information available at the end of each period.

Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring-Related Assets

—Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its
electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber
system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which
Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer
acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the
Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related
deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates
its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance
rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the
resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight-line method with a 14-year life for non-pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe
and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination.

Revenue Recognition

—Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction-related
projects are recorded primarily under the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at
completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long-term contracts. Provisions for anticipated
losses are made in the period in which they become determinable.

Product
discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.



Loss Contingencies

—Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the
normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially
determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Asbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables

—We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as
defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and
defense costs predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on
an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, we use multiple estimation
methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. We have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable
estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens.

In
connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, we record asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos-related
insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In
determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers.

Annually,
we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the
estimated asbestos-related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we re-evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect
changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of
asbestos-related assets and liabilities.

Income Taxes

—In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and
judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax
and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

In
evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative
losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre-tax operating income, the
reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income
and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more-likely-than-not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the
future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate
jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred
tax assets. An increase in



the
valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

Changes
in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the Company's
deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to
the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the
reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairments

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and
more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including
expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available) and other market data.

We
elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill
impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on
forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital for market participants. A market
approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent
available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered
potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting
unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of
goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value
of goodwill.

Based
on our most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we determined that none of our reporting units with significant
goodwill were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.

Fair
value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and
assumptions



made
for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect
the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows:

•

A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and prices)
especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets;

•

An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree;

•

Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and

•

Unexpected regulatory changes.

While
historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in
the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material.

Long-Lived Assets

—Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow
analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash
flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long-lived assets to be disposed of are recorded
based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long-lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated
future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, there is a
risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may be overstated or understated.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

—Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in
determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic
factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in
actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the
average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected
future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount
rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $89 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately $7 million. We consider the relative
weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long-term periods, asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining
the expected long-term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $8 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the
operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the



world.
The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition, we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to committed
revolving credit lines and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our
core businesses, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating
activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs.

We
had $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. Cash generated by operating
activities increased to $2.6 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2009. Cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion for the 2010 fiscal year
compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $0.3 billion in fiscal 2009.

As
of September 24, 2010, our shareholder's equity was $14.1 billion and our total debt was $4.2 billion. In addition, we had lines of credit totaling approximately
$1.7 billion, none of which were drawn. Our ratio of total debt to total capital (the sum of our short- and long-term debt and shareholders' equity) was 23% at September 24, 2010 and 25%
at September 25, 2009. This ratio is a measure of our long-term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility.

We
continue to monitor market conditions and assess the impact, if any, on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. More than 95% of our U.S. and non-U.S. funded
pension plans are invested in marketable investments, including publicly-traded equity and fixed income securities. Our funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs
of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary contributions from time to time. We anticipate that we will contribute at least the minimum required to our pension plans
in 2011 of $12 million for the U.S. plans and $52 million for non-U.S. plans. We also anticipate making discretionary contributions of approximately $20 million to our U.S. plans
during 2011.

The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $106 million in 2010. The components of this change are set forth in detail in
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $119 million increase in accounts payable and an $88 million decrease in prepaid and
other current assets which were partially offset by a $108 million increase in inventories.

The
net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $128 million in 2009. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $346 million decrease in inventory, a $191 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $106 million net decrease in
contracts in progress, partially offset by a $337 million decrease in accounts payable and a $138 million decrease in income taxes, net.

The
net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $640 million in 2008. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $186 million increase in accounts receivable, a $140 million increase in inventories and a $155 million decrease in
accrued and other liabilities.



During
2010, 2009 and 2008 we paid approximately $160 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as held for sale),
$152 million and $186 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our
restructuring activities.

Income
taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $255 million, $281 million and $489 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Cash flow from investing activities

We
made capital expenditures of $718 million, $702 million and $722 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal year 2011 is
expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2010 and is also expected to exceed depreciation.

During
2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid approximately $559 million, $543 million and $376 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 501,000, 512,000 and
370,000 customer contracts for electronic security services within our ADT Worldwide segment.

During
2010, net cash paid for Broadview Security totaled $448 million by the Company's ADT Worldwide segment. In addition to the net cash paid to acquire Broadview Security, we
issued approximately $1.4 billion of common shares as consideration. We paid cash for other acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $152 million, net of cash acquired of
$1 million. Additionally, our Flow Control segment acquired two Brazilian valve companies, including Hiter Industria e Comercio de Controle Termo-Hidraulico Ltda ("Hiter"), a valve manufacturer
which serves a variety of industries including the oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical markets. Net cash paid for the Brazilian valve companies totaled $104 million. Our Electrical and
Metal Products segment acquired certain assets of a business for $39 million and our Safety Products segment acquired a business for $9 million.

During
2010, we received cash proceeds, net of cash retained in the amount of $21 million for divestitures included in continuing operations primarily within our Safety Products,
Flow Control, and ADT Worldwide segments.

During
the second quarter of 2008, Tyco released $2,960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as $60 million of interest earned on
those funds for the benefit of the class stipulated in the court's final order related to the class action settlement of claims alleging securities fraud for actions taken by former senior management.

Cash flow from financing activities

On May 5, 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), our finance subsidiary, issued $500 million aggregate
principal amount of 3.375% notes due on October 15, 2015, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us, and received net cash proceeds of approximately $495 million.

On
May 28, 2010, we used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional cash on hand to redeem notes which aggregated $878 million in principal amount. The
notes that were redeemed were TIFSA's 6.375% notes due 2011, its 7% notes due 2028 and its 6.875% notes due 2029.

On
October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% notes due on October 15, 2014, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
us, and received net cash proceeds of approximately $495 million.

Net
repayments of short-term debt were approximately $243 million in 2010, which primarily related to the extinguishment of $200 million of outstanding commercial paper
during the first quarter of 2010. As of September 24, 2010, there was no commercial paper outstanding. Additionally,



repayments
of long-term debt were $962 million, which primarily related to the redemption of all of the 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028, and 6.875% notes due 2029. The
repayments of long-term debt were more than offset by approximately $1.0 billion of proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt.

Pursuant
to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market,
or pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 24, 2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common shares
of the remaining $900 million authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on July 10, 2008. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program ("2010 Share Repurchase Program").

On
March 10, 2010, our shareholders approved an annual dividend on our common shares of CHF 0.90 per share, which is being paid in the form of a return on capital in four
installments of CHF 0.22, CHF 0.22, CHF 0.23 and CHF 0.23 through February 2011. During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we paid cash dividends of approximately
$416 million, $388 million and $292 million, respectively.

Management
believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, including quarterly dividend
payments and share repurchases.

(3)

Excludes
interest.

(4)

Purchase
obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services.

(5)

Other
long-term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs,
income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these obligations. However, the
minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $64 million in 2011 and we expect to pay $6 million in 2011 related to postretirement benefit plans. In
addition, we expect to make a payment of $156 million for resolution of certain of the outstanding IRS audit matters within the next twelve months (see Note 6). As of September 24, 2010,
we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $318 million and gross interest and penalties of $63 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the
payments in future years of such unrecognized tax benefits; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the current status of our income
tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between $18 million and $140 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months.

As of September 24, 2010, we had total commitments of $1.69 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $500 million of
which expires on June 24, 2011 and $1.19 billion of which expires on April 25, 2012. As of September 24, 2010, there were no amounts drawn under these revolving credit
facilities.

TIFSA's
bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and
sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business.

In
May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program
are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 24, 2010, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



In
connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under the Separation
and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre-Separation contingent and other corporate
liabilities, which, as of September 24, 2010, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spin-offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party.

Backlog

As of September 24, 2010 we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.5 billion compared to a backlog of $8.9 billion
as of September 25, 2009. We expect that approximately 87% of our backlog as of September 24, 2010 will be filled during the next 12 months. Backlog by segment was as follows

Backlog
increased $569 million, or 6.4%, to $9.5 billion as of September 24, 2010. The increase in backlog was primarily due to an increase in recurring
revenue-in-force in our ADT Worldwide segment, partially offset by decreased bookings in our Flow Control segment. ADT Worldwide's backlog includes recurring revenue-in-force and long-term deferred
revenue for upfront fees paid by customers for ADT owned security systems. Revenue-in-force represents 12 months' revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the
security business. ADT Worldwide's backlog of $6.6 billion and $5.9 billion as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, consists primarily of
$4.8 billion and $4.0 billion of recurring revenue-in-force as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, and $1.1 billion of deferred revenue for both
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. ADT Worldwide's backlog increased $673 million primarily driven by an increase in revenue-in-force of $724 million, including
$540 million estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition, and favorable changes in foreign currency of $15 million. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in bookings of $48 million in our ADT EMEA operations and a reduction in deferred revenue of $36 million. Flow Control's backlog decreased by $164 million primarily due
to
decreased bookings of $162 million as several large projects were completed during fiscal 2010. Fire Protection's backlog increased by $25 million primarily due to an increase of
$100 million in the Asia-Pacific region and favorable changes in foreign currency of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases experienced in EMEA and North America
of $57 million and $18 million, respectively. Backlog within Safety Products increased $19 million primarily as a result of increased orders across various businesses.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sale of Accounts Receivable

Certain of our international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short-term financing mechanisms. The aggregate
amount outstanding under our international accounts receivable programs was not material as of September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 or September 26, 2008.



Guarantees

Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted
work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be
triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax
Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to
recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to
the Separation we provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned
in connection with the Separation, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. These obligations were not material to us as of September 24, 2010.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets,
environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax
liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of these liabilities.

In
the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of
management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
of September 24, 2010, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $740 million.

For
a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions.
These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate
and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial
instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative
financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non-functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of
mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so.

We
do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor
its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A-/A3 long-term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there
is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party.

Foreign Currency Exposures

We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange
contracts. During 2010, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The
market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts (excluding the dividend hedge contract discussed below) is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the
value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency
exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 24, 2010. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency
exchange rates would result in an immaterial net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would
result in an immaterial net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying
transactions.

Effective
March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Until the last payment is made in February 2011, Tyco intends to make
dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital denominated in Swiss francs. However, the Company expects to actually pay these dividends in U.S. dollars, based on exchange rates in effect
shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the U.S. dollar
amount required to be paid. The Company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges
of the underlying risk. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $21 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10%
depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $25 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative
instruments are economically offset by the amount of the dividend we would be required to pay.

During
the third quarter of 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), the Company's finance subsidiary, entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge its Euro
denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately $255 million as of September 24, 2010. The potential impact from a 10% appreciation of the
U.S.



dollar
relative to the Euro would result in a $25 million net increase in other comprehensive income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a
$30 million net decrease in other comprehensive income.

As
of September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009 $3.0 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature. For the fiscal years ended
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, we recorded $24 million and nil, respectively, of cumulative translation loss through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to
these loans.

Interest Rate Exposures

Our long-term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed-rate instruments. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the use
of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. During the third quarter of 2009,
first quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest
rates on $1.4 billion, $500 million, and $501 million, respectively of fixed-rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, the Company agreed with financial institutions acting as
principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. In connection with the
redemption of all of the 6.375% public notes due 2011 during the third quarter of 2010, the Company terminated the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 24, 2010 and
September 25, 2009, the total gross notional amount of the Company's interest rate swap contracts was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in
interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 24, 2010 would result in a $37 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease
in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 24, 2010 would result in a $38 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts.

Commodity Exposures

We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into
hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper which
are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, a
100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of September 24, 2010 would not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
September 24, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 24, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, these internal controls.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
Company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles,



and
that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Management's
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as of September 24, 2010.

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2010, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited
and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, and their report is also included in this Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discussion of Management's Responsibility

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
information appearing in this report. We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to being recognized as a leader in governance, controls, clarity and transparency of financial
statements. We are committed to making honesty, integrity and transparency the hallmarks of how we run Tyco. We believe that to succeed in today's environment requires more than just compliance with
laws and regulations—it requires a culture based upon the highest levels of integrity and ethical values. Expected behavior starts with our Board of Directors and our senior team leading
by example and includes every one of Tyco's global employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and business partners. One of our most crucial objectives is continuing to maintain and build on the
public, employee and shareholder confidence that has been restored in Tyco. We believe this is being accomplished; first, by issuing financial information
and related disclosures that are accurate, complete and transparent so investors are well informed; second, by supporting a leadership culture based on an ethic of uncompromising integrity and
accountability; and third, by recruiting, training and retaining high-performance individuals who have the highest ethical standards. We take full responsibility for meeting this objective. We
maintain appropriate accounting standards and disclosure controls and devote our full commitment and the necessary resources to these items.

Dedication to Governance, Controls and Financial Reporting

Throughout 2010, we continued to maintain and enhance internal controls over financial reporting, disclosures and corporate governance
practices. We believe that a strong control environment is a dynamic process. Therefore, we intend to continue to devote the necessary resources to maintain and improve our internal controls and
corporate governance.

Our
Audit Committee meets regularly and separately with management, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors, and our internal auditors to discuss financial reports, controls and
auditing.

We,
our Board and our Audit Committee are all committed to excellence in governance, financial reporting and controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 24, 2010 and September 25,
2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 24, 2010. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries as of
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 24, 2010, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance related to the measurement date of defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans effective September 27, 2008.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
September 24, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 24, 2010, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2010, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2010 of the Company and our report dated November 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial statement schedule.

TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

—The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a corporation organized
under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in
United States dollars ("USD") and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Certain information described under article 663-663h of the Swiss Code of
Obligations has been presented in the Company's Swiss statutory financial statements for the period ended September 24, 2010. Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated
Financial Statements to 2010, 2009 and 2008 are to Tyco's fiscal year ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively.

Effective
June 29, 2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly the Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly
traded companies (the "Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders. During 2008, the Company incurred pre-tax costs related to the Separation of $275 million. Of this
amount, $4 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008. Additionally, $258 million in 2008 is related to loss on early extinguishment of debt and is
included in other expense, net. Separation costs included in interest expense, net during 2008 were $47 million related to the write-off of unamortized credit facility fees. Also during 2010,
2009 and 2008, $8 million of income, $14 million of expense and $34 million of income, respectively, relating to the Tax Sharing Agreement is included in other expense, net.

Revenue
related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti-theft systems is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to the first
quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti-theft systems was misclassified as service revenue. Such item had no effect on net revenue,
operating income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows. No changes have been made to previously filed financial statements or in the comparative amounts presented herein, as the effect in prior
periods is not material. Revenue related to the sale of such electronic tags and labels reflected as service revenue was $286 million and $364 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
related cost of services was $176 million and $221 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The
Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday in September. Fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were all 52-week years. Fiscal 2011 will be a 53-week year which
will end on September 30, 2011.

Principles of Consolidation

—Tyco is a holding company which conducts its business through its operating subsidiaries. The Company consolidates
companies in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or has the ability to control through similar rights. Also, the Company consolidates variable interest entities in
which the Company bears a majority of the risk of the entities' expected losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. References
to the segment data are to the Company's continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these
Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring charges, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows associated with



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

asset
impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies (including legal, environmental and asbestos reserves), net realizable value of inventories, fair values of
financial instruments, estimated contract revenue and related costs, income taxes and tax valuation allowances, and pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ
materially from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company recognizes revenue principally on four types of transactions—sales of products, sales of security systems,
billings for monitoring and maintenance services and contract sales.

Revenue
from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass. This is generally when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point,
the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Provisions
for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in determining sales in the same period the
related sales are recorded. These provisions are based on terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Sales
of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. The Company assesses its revenue
arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate
unit of accounting. Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for
monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using each
deliverable's relative fair value. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the relative fair value method or the non-contingent
up-front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance
services.

For
transactions in which the Company retains ownership of the subscriber system asset, fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
contract term. Non-refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract, along with associated direct and incremental selling costs, are deferred and amortized over the
estimated life of the customer relationship.

While
the Company does not expect situations where fair value cannot be objectively determined for sales of security systems and services, if such cases were to arise, the Company's
policy is to recognize revenue for all elements over the contract life.

Revenue
from the sale of services is recognized as services are rendered. Customer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are
rendered and the associated deferred revenue is included in current liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

Contract
sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction-related projects are recorded primarily under the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The extent of progress toward
completion is generally measured



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

based
on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost at completion. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period.
Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Estimated warranty costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the
construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting.

At
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, accounts receivable and other long-term receivables included retainage provisions of $62 million and $66 million,
respectively, of which $45 million and $46 million are unbilled, respectively. These retainage provisions consist primarily of fire protection contracts and become due upon contract
completion and acceptance. As of September 24, 2010 the retainage provision included $50 million that is expected to be collected during fiscal 2011.

Research and Development

—Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of product sales, which amounted to
$131 million, $116 million and $125 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred and building and
overhead expenses.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, which amounted to $164
million, $131 million and $142 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Translation of Foreign Currency

—For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that account in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars, assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation
gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders' equity.

Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including the impact of foreign currency derivatives related to operating activities and dividends declared in Swiss
francs, are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses and other expense, net, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in Tyco's
receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

—Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market value.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

—Property, Plant and Equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense for
2010, 2009 and 2008 was $654 million, $610 million and $620 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when

incurred.
Except for pooled subscriber systems, depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Subscriber systems

Accelerated method up to 15 years

Other machinery, equipment and furniture and fixtures

2 to 20 years

See
below for discussion of depreciation method and estimated useful lives related to subscriber systems.

Subscriber System Assets and Related Deferred Revenue Accounts

—The Company considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its
electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber
system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which
Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets represent capitalized equipment (e.g. security control panels,
touchpad, motion detectors, window sensors and other equipment) and installation costs associated with electronic security monitoring arrangements under which the Company retains ownership of the
security system assets in a customer's residence or place of business. Installation costs represent costs incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use. The Company pays property taxes on the
subscriber system assets and upon customer termination, may retrieve such assets. These assets embody a probable future economic benefit as they generate future monitoring revenue for the Company.

Costs
related to the subscriber system equipment and installation are categorized as property, plant and equipment rather than deferred costs. Deferred costs associated with subscriber
system assets represent direct and incremental selling expenses (i.e. commissions) related to acquiring the customer. Commissions related to up-front consideration paid by customers in connection with
the establishment of the monitoring arrangement are determined based on a percentage of the up-front fees and do not exceed deferred revenue. Such deferred costs are recorded as non-current assets and
are included in other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Subscriber
system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where
the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools
for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the same month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily
in North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from
160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight-line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that
from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight-line method with a 14-year life for non-pooled



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

subscriber
system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination.

Long-Lived Asset Impairments

—Tyco reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, for impairment
whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine
if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately
identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated
proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairments

—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and
more frequently if triggering events occur (see Note 9). In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic
projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors which require judgment in applying them to the
analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The Company performed its annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on the first day of
the fourth quarter of 2010.

When
testing for goodwill impairment, the Company first compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined
utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's future budgets discounted using market participants' weighted-average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash
flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of
a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill
impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied
fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all
of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the
amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.

Indefinite
lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights are tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method.

Dealer and Other Amortizable Intangible Assets, Net

—Intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer relationships and intellectual
property. Certain contracts and related customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the
ADT dealer program. Acquired contracts and related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

During
the first six months (twelve months in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from
customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a
reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset.

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program described above are amortized in pools determined by the same month and year of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over
the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship.

The
estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles is 15 years. The Company amortizes
dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. Other contracts and related customer relationships, as well as intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks, copyrights and
unpatented technology, are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 4 to 40 years. The Company evaluates the amortization methods and remaining useful lives of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events
and circumstances warrant a revision to the amortization method or remaining useful lives.

Investments

—The Company invests in debt and equity securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity securities that represent less than twenty
percent ownership are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity for
available for sale securities unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management determines the proper classification of
investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classifications as of
each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other
equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. Each reporting period, the Company evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that they are
recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For equity investments in which the Company exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies but does not control,
the equity method of accounting is used. The Company's share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and was not material in any period
presented.

Product Warranty

—The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. Products are warranted against defects in material and
workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Generally, product warranties are implicit in the sale; however, the customer may purchase
an extended warranty. However, in most instances the warranty is either negotiated in the contract or sold as a separate component. Warranty period terms range from 90 days up to 15 years. The
warranty liability is determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain
instances estimated property damage.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Environmental Costs

—Tyco is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the
environment. Tyco provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.

Income Taxes

—Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss
carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, including consideration of tax planning strategies, it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Asbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables

—The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as
defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future
claims and defense costs is predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next
seven years on an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, the Company uses
multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. The Company has concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period
will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens.

In
connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, the Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The Company's estimate of
asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for
pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and
creditworthiness of the insurers.

Insurable Liabilities

—The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these
liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon
historical claims experience. Certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a risk-free rate of return when the pattern and timing of the future obligation is reliably determinable. The impact of
the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 was to reduce the obligation by $21 million and $20 million, respectively.
The Company maintains captive insurance companies to manage certain of its
insurable liabilities. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Financial Instruments

—The Company may use interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward and option contracts and commodity swaps to manage risks
generally associated with interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity prices. Derivatives used for hedging purposes are designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure
at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract are highly effective at offsetting the changes in the fair



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

value
of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and are expected to remain highly effective over the life of the hedge contract.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet
items related to operating activities are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to
economically hedge dividends declared in Swiss francs are reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of other expense, net along with offsetting transaction gains and
losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates are reported in interest expense along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items
being hedged. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent they are effective. Gains
and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of
the hedged transactions. The Company classifies cash flows associated with the settlement of derivatives consistent with the nature of the transaction being hedged. The Company did not have any cash
flow hedges during 2010. The ineffective portion of all hedges, if any, is recognized currently in earnings as noted above. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market
with changes recognized in current earnings.

Reclassifications

—Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Specifically, the Company has
reclassified certain businesses which have satisfied the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations to income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
assets and liabilities held for sale within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2. Additionally, the Company has realigned certain business operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2010,
resulting in prior period segment amounts being recast. See Note 19.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

—In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for employers' disclosures about
postretirement benefit plan assets. The guidance requires additional disclosures about plan assets related to an employer's defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans to enable investors
to better understand how investment decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value
measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The disclosure provisions of the
guidance were adopted concurrent with the pension disclosures associated with the Company's annual valuation process during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not impact the Company's
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 15.

In
June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ratified authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are
participating securities. The guidance addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment awards are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, must be included in the
earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two-class method. The guidance requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend-equivalents be treated as participating securities in calculating earnings per share. The guidance became effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and was applied
retrospectively to prior periods. The adoption



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

did
not have a material impact on the Company's historical annual or quarterly basic and diluted earnings per share. See Note 7 for additional information related to the adoption of the
guidance.

In
December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations. The revised guidance retains the underlying concepts of the existing guidance in that
business combinations are still accounted for at fair value. However, the accounting for certain other aspects of business combinations will be affected. Acquisition costs will generally be expensed
as incurred. Restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. In-process research and development will be recorded at fair
value as an indefinite-lived intangible at the acquisition date until it is completed or abandoned and its useful life can be determined. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and
uncertain tax positions after the acquisition date will generally impact income tax expense. The revised guidance also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of
business combinations. The revised guidance was adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. The revised guidance is primarily effective for all business combinations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and thereafter, including the acquisition of Broadview
Security. See Note 4.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The guidance requires the recognition of a
noncontrolling interest (minority interest prior to the adoption of the guidance) as equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling
interest should be included in consolidated net income on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The guidance also amends certain existing consolidation procedures in order to achieve
consistency with the requirements of the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations discussed above. The guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests
of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. The guidance was adopted by Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and was applied retrospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. The
guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. The guidance was adopted in two phases. Tyco adopted the fair value
provisions relating to financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2009 and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a
material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for determining the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The guidance became effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not
have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the accounting for revenue arrangements
with multiple deliverables. The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on
vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

evidence
if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific evidence nor third-party evidence is available. The guidance requires
arrangements under which multiple revenue generating activities to be performed be allocated at inception. The residual method under the existing accounting guidance has been eliminated. The guidance
expands the disclosure requirements related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The guidance becomes effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2011. The guidance applies on a prospective basis. The Company believes that the guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which amended the existing guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, to address the elimination of the
concept of a qualifying special purpose entity. The guidance also replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in
a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity, and the obligation to absorb losses of the
entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, the guidance requires any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity to provide enhanced disclosures
that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise's involvement in a variable interest entity. The guidance is effective for Tyco in the first
quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company believes that the guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

2.    Divestitures

The Company has continued to assess the strategic fit of its various businesses and has pursued divestiture of certain businesses which do not align with its long-term strategy.

During
the third quarter of 2010, the Board of Directors approved a plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Tyco's Electrical and Metal Products business. On November 9, 2010, the
Company announced an agreement to sell a 51% interest in its Electrical and Metal Products business. In connection with this announcement, the Company no longer plans to pursue the
tax-free spin-off of our Electrical and Metal Products business as proposed on April 27, 2010. See Note 25.

During
the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company approved a plan to sell its French security business, which was part of the Company's ADT Worldwide segment. This business has been
classified as held for sale as of September 25, 2009; however, its results of operations were presented in continuing operations as the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations were
not met. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company completed the sale and recorded a $53 million pre-tax gain within restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net in the Company's
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

During
the third quarter of 2008, the Company approved a plan to sell a business in its Safety Products segment. This business had been classified as held for sale in the Company's
historical Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the second quarter of 2009, due to a change in strategy by management, the Company decided not to sell the business. As a result, the business no longer
satisfied the requirements to be classified as held for sale. The Company measured the business at the lower of its (i) carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted for
depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the business been continuously classified as held and used, or (ii) fair value at the date the decision not to sell was
made. The Company recorded a

charge
of $8 million in the second quarter of 2009 relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had the asset been continuously classified as
held and used.

Discontinued Operations

Fiscal 2010

During the quarter ended June 25, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a plan to sell the Company's European water business,
which is part of the Company's Flow Control segment. Subject to the receipt of certain consents and approvals and other customary closing conditions, the Company has agreed to sell the business for
approximately $245 million. As of September 24, 2010, the necessary consents and approvals had not been obtained. The business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria
and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. As of September 24, 2010, the Company had assessed and determined that the carrying value of the remaining assets were
recoverable based on current fair value, less cost to sell. The transaction has subsequently closed and the Company expects to record a gain on the transaction. See Note 25.

Fiscal 2009

In July 2008, the Company substantially completed the sale of its Infrastructure Services business, which met the criteria to be
presented as discontinued operations. In order to complete the sale of the remaining Infrastructure Services businesses, Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. ("ET Brasil"), the Earth Tech UK businesses and certain
assets in China, the Company was required to obtain consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the businesses and assets. By the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company received all the
necessary consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the businesses and assets and received cash proceeds of $61 million. As a result of the fiscal 2009 dispositions, a net
pre-tax gain of $33 million was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
September 25, 2009.

Fiscal 2008

During 2008, the Company sold its Empresa de Transmissao de Energia do Oeste Ltda. ("ETEO") business, Ancon Building Products ("Ancon")
business, Nippon Dry-Chemical Co., Ltd. ("NDC") business, and a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems. As discussed above, the Company also substantially completed the
sale of its Infrastructure Services Business during the fourth quarter of 2008. These businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued
operations in all periods presented.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.    Divestitures (Continued)

In May 2008, the Company sold 100% of the stock of ETEO, a Brazilian subsidiary of the Company's Infrastructure Services business for $338 million of net cash proceeds and
recorded a pre-tax gain of $232 million, including the effects of the economic hedge of the purchase price discussed below. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of
income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008. ETEO was part of the Company's Corporate and Other. During September 2007, Tyco
entered into an economic hedge of the Brazilian Real denominated contractual sale price of the ETEO business. Since the hedging transaction was directly linked to the proceeds from the sale of a
business that was reflected in discontinued operations, Tyco began including the impact of the hedge in discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, Tyco
incurred a pre-tax loss of $36 million on this hedge.

Additionally
in fiscal year 2008, the Company settled a contract dispute arising under its former Infrastructure Services business. In connection with the settlement, the Company
assessed its assets under the original contract and concluded the assets were no longer recoverable, resulting in a $51 million charge to discontinued operations.

During
April 2008, the Company sold Ancon, a manufacturer of stainless steel products used in masonry construction. Ancon was part of the Company's Corporate and Other. The sale
was completed for $164 million in net cash proceeds and a pre-tax gain of $100 million was recorded which was largely
exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company received an additional $6 million of proceeds related to the sale of Ancon.

During
February 2008, the Company sold NDC, a company in the Japanese fire protection industry. NDC was part of the Company's Fire Protection Services and Safety Products
segments. The sale was completed for $50 million in net cash proceeds and a pre-tax gain of $7 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of
income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008.

During
January 2008, the Company sold a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems, which was part of the Company's Fire Protection Services Segment and
recorded an $8 million pre-tax loss on sale. The loss was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
year ended September 26, 2008.

During
fiscal year 2007, Tyco completed the spin-offs of its Healthcare and Electronics businesses (the "Separation"). The Company has used available information to develop its best
estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. There were no adjustments during
the year ended September 24, 2010. During the year ended September 25, 2009, $43 million was recorded through shareholders' equity, $9 million of which related to a pre-Separation
income tax filing in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and $34 million of other items. During the year ended September 26, 2008, $70 million of other items were recorded through
shareholders' equity. The other items discussed above, which aggregate $104 million, reflect immaterial adjustments to shareholders' equity which were recorded to correct the distribution
amount at the date of Separation. Adjustments in the future for the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien
and/or Tyco Electronics legal entities and for certain amended income tax returns for the periods prior to the Separation may be recorded to either shareholders' equity or the Consolidated Statement
of Operations depending on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment.

Divestiture Charges, Net

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded a net gain of $40 million, and a net loss of $15 million and
$1 million, respectively, in restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with the divestiture and
write-down to fair value less cost to sell of certain businesses that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. The net gain for 2010 includes the $53 million gain recognized upon
the sale of the Company's French security business.

2007 Program and pre-2006 Actions

During fiscal 2007 and 2008, the Company launched a restructuring program across all of the Company's segments, including the corporate
organization, to streamline some of the businesses and reduce the operational footprint (the "2007 Program"). As of December 26, 2008, the Company had substantially completed this program. The
Company maintained a restructuring reserve related to the 2007 Program of $26 million and $59 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. The
Company utilized $33 million of the restructuring reserve balance during the fiscal 2010. In addition, the Company continues to maintain restructuring reserves related to certain actions
initiated prior to 2006. The total amount of these reserves were $14 million as of September 24, 2010 and $15 million as of September 25, 2009. The aggregate remaining
reserves related to the 2007 Program and pre-2006 actions include employee severance and benefits as well as facility exit costs for long-term non-cancelable lease obligations with expiration dates
that range from 2011 to 2022 primarily within the Company's ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Fire Protection Services segments. The Company incurred $3 million, $5 million and

Acquisition of Brink's Home Security Holdings, Inc.

On May 14, 2010, the Company's ADT Worldwide segment acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brink's Home Security Holdings,
Inc ("Broadview Security"), a publicly
traded company that was formerly owned by The Brink's Company, in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $2.0 billion. Broadview Security is being integrated into the Company's
ADT Worldwide segment. Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of Broadview Security common stock was converted into the right to receive: (1) $13.15 in cash and 0.7562 Tyco
common shares, for those shareholders who made an all-cash election, (2) 1.0951 Tyco common shares, for those shareholders who made an all stock election or (3) $12.75 in cash and 0.7666
Tyco common shares, for those shareholders who made a mixed cash/stock election or who failed to make an election.

Broadview
Security's core business is to provide security alarm monitoring services for residential and commercial properties in North America. Broadview Security has a large residential
recurring customer base, which expands the Company's presence in the North American residential security business. Broadview Security is also a leader in technologies and services, which are expected
to enhance ADT Worldwide's service offerings to its customers. The Company expects to realize cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including consolidation of both
marketing and general and administrative functions.

pre-combination service and included in the consideration transferred. In addition, there were certain Broadview Security stock based compensation awards which did not immediately vest upon completion
of the acquisition. For those awards, the fair value of the awards attributed to pre-combination service was included as part of the consideration transferred and the fair value attributed to
post-combination service is being recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period in the post-combination financial statements of Tyco.

Fair Value Allocation of Consideration Transferred to Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

The consideration transferred for Broadview Security has been allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of
the acquisition date based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The final determinations of fair value for certain assets and liabilities remain subject to change based on final valuations of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company does not expect the finalization of the valuation to have a material effect on the allocation, which is expected to be completed no later than one
year from the acquisition date. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded purchase accounting adjustments which were not material individually or in the aggregate. The following amounts

4.    Acquisitions (Continued)

During
the year ended September 26, 2008, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $347 million, net of cash acquired of $8 million. The
Company's ADT Worldwide segment acquired Winner Security Services LLC ("Winner") for $63 million and Sensormatic Security Corp. ("SSC") for $66 million, which were franchises originally
granted by Sensormatic Electronics Corporation ("Sensormatic") and granted Winner rights to sell, install and service certain Sensormatic products and entitled Winner and SSC to commissions on
Sensormatic products sold, installed or shipped into its franchise territories. Additionally, the Company's ADT Worldwide segment acquired FirstService Security for $180 million, net of cash
acquired of $7 million. Cash paid for other acquisitions primarily within the Company's ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments totaled $38 million, net of cash acquired of
$1 million.

These
acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tyco's consolidated results from the respective
acquisition dates.

ADT Worldwide Account Acquisitions

During 2010, 2009 and 2008 Tyco paid $559 million, $543 million and $376 million of cash, respectively, to acquire
approximately 501,000, 512,000 and 370,000 customer contracts for electronic security services in the Company's ADT Worldwide segment.

5.    Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net of $75 million in 2010 primarily relates to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of the Company's 6.375% public notes
due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 11. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of an increase in the receivables due from
Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6.

Other
expense, net of $7 million in 2009 primarily relates to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco
Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk
related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends.

Other
expense, net of $223 million in 2008 primarily relates to a charge of $258 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and
exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related
financial instruments. The Company also recorded other-than-temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate
debt. Additionally, the Company recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement in connection
with the adoption of the guidance pertaining to the accounting for
uncertain income taxes. The Company also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008.

As
of September 24, 2010, the Company had $7,735 million of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Of these, $4,785 million have no
expiration, and the remaining $2,950 million will expire in future years through 2029. In the U.S., there were approximately $2,173 million of federal and $1,842 million of state
net operating loss carryforwards as of September 24, 2010, which will expire in future years through 2029.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,379 million and $766 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and
recorded when the Company determined that it was more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient
future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Tyco
adopted the recognition, measurement and disclosure guidance for the accounting of uncertain tax positions on September 29, 2007. As a result of this adoption, Tyco increased
its reserve for uncertain tax positions by $55 million and reduced its deferred tax assets by $24 million with a corresponding $79 million cumulative effect of adoption adjustment
to shareholders' equity. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, Tyco had unrecognized tax benefits of $318 million and $281 million, respectively, of which
$276 million and $221 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Tyco recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expense. Tyco had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $63 million and $50 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009,
respectively. Tyco

Tax Sharing Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the spin-offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally
governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics' and Tyco's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the Separation with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes,
if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within
the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

6.    Income Taxes (Continued)

Under
the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company shares responsibility for certain of Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' income tax liabilities, which result in cash payments, based on
a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities
that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' U.S. and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. The costs and expenses associated with the management of
these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. In connection with the execution of the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco established a net receivable from Covidien and Tyco
Electronics representing the amount the Company expected to receive for pre-Separation uncertain tax positions. Such amounts include any amounts owed to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). As of
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, the aggregate amount of the net receivable was $114 million and $106 million, respectively, of which
$89 million and $103 million, respectively, was included in other assets and $25 million and $3 million, respectively, was included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also established liabilities representing the fair market value of its share of Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' estimated obligations, primarily
to the
IRS, for their pre-Separation taxes covered by the Tax Sharing Agreement. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the Company had recorded $398 million and
$554 million, respectively in other liabilities and $156 million and nil, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company
reclassified $156 million from other liabilities to accrued and other current liabilities as it expects to make a payment within the next twelve months to Covidien and Tyco Electronics related
to resolution of certain of the outstanding IRS audit matters discussed below.

Tyco
assesses the shared tax liabilities and related guaranteed liabilities at each reporting period. The receivable and liability were initially recognized with an offset to
shareholders' equity at the time of the Separation in 2007. The Company recorded income of $8 million and expense of $14 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, in accordance with the
Tax Sharing Agreement. In the first quarter of 2008, in connection with the adoption of the guidance pertaining to the accounting for uncertain income tax positions and the related increase in
uncertain tax positions for shared tax liabilities under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco increased its receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement with a
corresponding increase to other income, net by $40 million ($0.08 for both basic and diluted earnings per share). Tyco will provide payment to Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax
Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the audit process by applicable taxing authorities is completed for the impacted years and cash
payments are made. Given the nature of the shared liabilities, the maximum amount of potential future payments is not determinable. Such cash payments, when they occur, will reduce the guarantor
liability as such payments represent an equivalent reduction of risk. The Company also assesses the sufficiency of the Tax Sharing Agreement guarantee liability on a quarterly basis and will increase
the liability when it is probable that cash payments expected to be made under the Tax Sharing Agreement exceed the recorded balance.

Tyco
and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised
issues and proposed tax adjustments, in particular with respect to years preceding the Separation. The issues and proposed adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the sharing
provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement. Tyco is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. With respect to adjustments raised by the IRS, although we expect to resolve a
substantial number of these



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

6.    Income Taxes (Continued)

adjustments
with the IRS, a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years. As of the date hereof, it is unlikely that the Company will be able
to resolve these open items, which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany transactions during the period, through the IRS appeals process. As a result, the Company may be required to
litigate these matters. The Company has assessed its obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, including with respect to the proposed civil fraud penalties discussed below, to determine that its
recorded liability of $554 million is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by the Company under such agreement. See Note 12. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is
uncertain and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods.

In
connection with the aforementioned audits, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics in connection with the
Separation. The penalties allegedly arise from actions of former executives taken in connection with intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory
guidelines, the Company estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. This is a pre-Separation tax liability that is covered by the provisions of the
Tax Sharing Agreement. Also in connection with the IRS audits described above, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company, as Audit Management Party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, reached a
settlement agreement with the IRS on certain deductions taken by Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics on pre-separation tax returns filed for the periods 2001 to 2004. The settlement did not have a
material effect to the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Notwithstanding this settlement, as mentioned above, certain significant items related to the audits of the
periods from 1997 to 2004 remain open. The Company considered the potential impact of the settlement as part of its quarterly assessment of the guarantee liability and concluded that no adjustment to
the liability was needed.

In
addition to dealing with pre-Separation tax liabilities of each of the three entities party thereto, the Tax Sharing Agreement contains sharing provisions to address the contingency
that the Separation itself, or internal transactions related to the Separation, may be deemed taxable by U.S. or non U.S. taxing authorities. In the event the Separation is determined to be taxable
and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on
each company as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken by any of the three companies after the Separation, then Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be
responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on any of the companies as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for
all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not
subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.

If
any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default on its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each
non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for
all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default on its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and
required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

6.    Income Taxes (Continued)

excess
of its agreed-upon share of Tyco's, Covidien's and Tyco Electronics' tax liabilities. See Note 12 for further discussion of guarantees and indemnifications extended between Tyco,
Covidien and Tyco Electronics.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for
unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, since the
earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the
distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional
income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

7.    Earnings Per Share

As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted the authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities
in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company historically issued certain restricted stock awards that vest over a period of three years which contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends and
should be treated as participating securities. These types of awards were last issued during fiscal 2006. Awards containing such rights that are unvested are considered to be participating securities
and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. All of these awards were vested as of September 25, 2009. As a result, the Company is not required to
compute earnings per share for fiscal 2010 using the two-class method unless new awards are granted. The retrospective application of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's historically
reported earnings per share for 2009 as the effects would be anti-dilutive because the Company reported a loss from continuing operations. In addition, the retrospective application of this guidance
for 2008 did not have an impact on the Company's historically reported earnings per share.

9.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Annually, in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company tests goodwill for impairment by
comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for each reporting unit is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's forecast
cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital of market participants. A market approach is utilized to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each
reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired. In determining fair value, management relies on and considers a number
of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash
flow, comparable market transactions (to the extent available), other market data and the Company's overall market capitalization. There were no goodwill impairments as a result of performing the
company's 2010 annual impairment test.

During
the first quarter of 2010, businesses were realigned among the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments and Fire Protection
Services and Safety Products segments. As a result of these realignments, goodwill was reallocated as detailed below. As part of the realignment the Company tested the related goodwill balances for
recoverability and determined goodwill was recoverable.

Fiscal 2009 Goodwill Impairment

The Company began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in its ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services
and Safety Products segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at its Electrical and Metal Products segment due
to the slow down in the non-residential construction market. Although the Company considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009, the
continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecast results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused the Company to
conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed for certain reporting units in the above mentioned businesses. The Company determined that these events and changes in circumstances
constituted triggering events for the following six reporting units: Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") Security and EMEA Fire reporting units within the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection
Services segments, respectively, Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit within the Electrical and Metal Products segment and Access Control and Video Systems ("ACVS"), Life Safety, and
Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Safety Products segment. As a result of the triggering events, the Company assessed the recoverability of each of the reporting unit's
long-lived assets and concluded that the carrying amounts were recoverable at



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

9.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)

March 27,
2009. Subsequently, the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units.

To
perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the six reporting units with triggering events, the Company compared the carrying amounts of these reporting units to their
estimated fair values. Fair value for each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating
income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of market participants. A market approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar
lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available), was used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each
reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a
number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated
future cash flow, comparable market transactions (to the extent available), other market data and the Company's overall market capitalization.

As
described above, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis for determining the fair value of each of the reporting units where triggering events had occurred. Based on the
factors described above, actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting unit's products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash
flows used in the
second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from the Company's most recent test conducted during the fourth quarter of 2008. The range of the weighted-average cost of
capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for the Company's products and services. The weighted-average cost of capital
were as follows:

Second Quarter

of 2009

Fourth Quarter

of 2008

Weighted-Average Cost of Capital

10.9% to 12.8%

10.0% to 11.7%

The
results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test indicated there was a potential impairment of goodwill in each of the six reporting units identified with triggering events,
as the carrying amounts of the reporting units exceeded their respective fair values. As a result, the Company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units. In
the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compared the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. The implied fair
values of goodwill were determined by allocating the fair values of each reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the applicable reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible
assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The results of the second step of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the
carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. The Company recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion
after-tax) which was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter ended March 27,

The
estimated aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets is expected to be approximately $550 million for 2011, $475 million for 2012, $400 million for
2013, $350 million for 2014 and $300 million for 2015.

Fiscal 2009 Intangible Asset Impairment

The Company began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 at its ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments
due to a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Although the Company considered and concluded these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter
of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecast results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused
the Company to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. This deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer business
of the Company's ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments resulted in a further lowering of management's projections of revenues from the retailer end market during the second quarter of 2009.

Based
on these factors and uncertainties described above, estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of the Company's Safety Products Sensormatic tradename as well
as its ADT Worldwide franchise rights relating to Winner and Sensormatic Security Corp ("SSC") during the second quarter of 2009 were revised downward relative to the estimates used in the Company's
most recent test during the fourth quarter of 2008. The range of the discount rates utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for
the Company's products and services. The discount rates were as follows:

Second Quarter

The
results of the impairment test indicated that the Safety Products Sensormatic tradename and ADT Worldwide Winner and SSC franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their
respective carrying amounts. As such, the Company recorded an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after-tax) which was recorded in goodwill and intangible
asset impairments in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Specifically, the Company recorded the following non-cash intangible asset
impairment charges to reduce the carrying amount of the following indefinite-lived intangible assets (in millions):

10.    Related Party Transactions

The Company has amounts due related to loans and advances issued to employees in prior years under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, relocation programs and other advances made to
executives. Loans were provided to employees under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, which is now discontinued, except for outstanding loans for the payment of taxes upon the vesting of shares
granted under our Restricted Share Ownership Plans. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors and new senior management adopted a policy under which no new loans are allowed to be
granted to any officers of the Company and existing loans are not allowed to be extended or modified. There have been no loans made to any of the Company's current executives. The outstanding loans
are not collateralized and bear interest, payable annually, at a rate based on the six-month LIBOR, calculated annually as the average of the rates in effect on the first day of each of the preceding
12 months. Loans are generally repayable in ten years; however, earlier payments are required under certain circumstances, such as when an employee is terminated. In addition, the Company made
mortgage loans to certain employees under employee relocation programs. These loans are generally payable in 15 years and are collateralized by the underlying property. During 2010 and 2009,
the maximum amount outstanding under these programs was $21 million and $22 million, respectively. Loans receivable under these programs, as well as other unsecured advances outstanding, were
$21 million and $22 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. The total outstanding loans receivable includes loans to L. Dennis
Kozlowski, the Company's former chairman and chief executive officer (until June 2002). The amount outstanding under these loans, plus accrued interest, was $28 million and
$27 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, and the rate of interest charged on such loans was 0.5% and 1.9% for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Interest income on these interest bearing loans totaled nil in both 2010 and 2009 and $1 million in 2008. Certain of the above loans totaling $1 million as of both September 24,
2010 and September 25, 2009 are non-interest bearing.

The
Company filed civil complaints against Messrs. Kozlowski and its former chief financial officer, Mark Swartz, for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to
alleged abuses of our
Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program, unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self-dealing transactions and other improper conduct.

In
June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related
wrongful conduct involving a $20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The
payment was purportedly made for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging our acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh pleaded guilty to a felony violation of
New York law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York County) and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the SEC in United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York. Both the felony charge and the civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such payment. The felony charge accused Mr. Walsh of intentionally
concealing information concerning the payment from Tyco's directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities in the State of New York. The SEC action alleged that Mr. Walsh
knew that the registration statement covering the sale of Tyco securities as part of the CIT Group acquisition contained a material misrepresentation concerning fees payable in connection with the
acquisition. Pursuant to the plea and settlement, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on December 17, 2002. In connection with the Company's civil complaint against
Mr. Walsh, in October 2010, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that while Mr. Walsh breached his fiduciary duties to the Company, the Company's
Board of Directors implicitly



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

10.    Related Party Transactions (Continued)

ratified
the payment to Mr. Walsh in the weeks immediately following the revelation of the payment to the Board of Directors in early 2002. As a result, the Court ruled that the Company is not
entitled to damages from Mr. Walsh. The Company believes, based on the facts and the law, that this determination by the Court is incorrect. The Company is in the process of appealing the
Court's ruling.

During
2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as
officers. Purchases from these companies during each year aggregated less than 1 percent of consolidated net revenue.

Fair Value

The carrying amount of Tyco's debt subject to the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 24, 2010 and
September 25, 2009 was $4,065 million and $4,155 million, respectively. The Company has determined the fair value of such debt to be $4,730 million and
$4,578 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. The Company utilizes various valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of its debt, which
is primarily dependent on the type of market in which the Company's debt is traded. When available, the Company uses quoted market

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

11.    Debt (Continued)

prices
to determine the fair value of its debt that is traded in active markets. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the fair value of the Company's debt that was actively
traded was $4,730 million and $4,338 million, respectively. When quoted market prices are not readily available or representative of fair value, the Company utilizes market information
of comparable debt with similar terms, such as maturities, interest rates and credit risk to determine the fair value of its debt that is traded in markets that are not active. During the third
quarter of 2010, the Company redeemed its public notes due 2028 and 2029. As a result, all of the Company's debt was actively traded as of September 24, 2010. As of September 25, 2009,
the fair value of the Company's debt that was not actively traded was $40 million. Additionally, the Company believes the carrying amount of its commercial paper of $200 million as of
September 25, 2009 approximated fair value based on the short-term nature of such debt. As of September 24, 2010, there was no commercial paper outstanding.

Commercial Paper

In May 2008, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA") commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited
investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 24, 2010, TIFSA had no commercial paper
outstanding. As of September 25, 2009, TIFSA had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding, which bore interest at an average rate of 0.33%.

Credit Facilities

The Company's committed revolving credit facilities totaled $1.69 billion as of September 24, 2010. This consists of a
$500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with a three year term due 2011 ("the 2011 revolving credit facility") and a $1.19 billion senior revolving credit agreement with
a five year term due 2012 ("the 2012 revolving credit agreement"). These revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. As of
September 24, 2010, there were no amounts drawn under these facilities. Interest under the revolving credit facilities is variable and is calculated by reference to LIBOR or an alternate base
rate.

TIFSA's
bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of the Company's debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization and that limit its ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. The Company's indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative
pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company's business.

On
January 29, 2009, the Company repaid $686 million to extinguish the entire outstanding balance under its revolving credit facilities. As of September 25, 2009,
there were no amounts drawn under these facilities, although the Company had dedicated $200 million of availability to backstop its outstanding commercial paper.

Debt Issuances/Repayments

On
May 5, 2010, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due on October 15, 2015, which are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the "2015 notes"). TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

11.    Debt (Continued)

approximately
$3 million and a debt discount of approximately $2 million. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding 6.375%
notes due October 2011 (the "2011 notes"). The 2015 notes are unsecured and rank equally with TIFSA's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. TIFSA may redeem any of the 2015 notes at any time
by paying the greater of the principal amount of the notes or a "make-whole" amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 2015 notes have the right to require TIFSA to repurchase all
or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering
event, which requires the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the Indenture governing the notes. The debt issuance costs will be amortized from the date of
issuance to the maturity date. Interest is payable semiannually on April 15

On
May 28, 2010, the Company redeemed all of its 2011 notes, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029 outstanding at that time, which aggregated $878 million in
principal amount. As a result of the debt redemption, the Company recorded an $87 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. The charge is comprised of the
make-whole premium, write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to the extinguished bonds and a net loss recognized upon termination of the associated interest rate swap
contracts related to the 2011 notes.

On
October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% notes due on October 15, 2014, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
the Company (the "2014 notes"). TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs of approximately $3 million and a debt discount of
approximately $2 million. The 2014 notes are unsecured and rank equally with TIFSA's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. TIFSA may redeem any of the 2014 notes at any time by paying the
greater of the principal amount of the notes or a "make-whole" amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the 2014 notes have the right to require TIFSA to repurchase all or a portion of

principal amount of the notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the notes mature on January 15, 2019. Debt issuance costs will be amortized from the date of issuance to
the earliest redemption date, which is July 15, 2014. Interest is payable semiannually on January 15th and July 15th. The interest rate payable on the 2019 notes is subject to
escalations, as defined by the Indenture, if either Moody's or S&P downgrades the Company's debt rating below investment grade. The 2019 notes will not be subject to the preceding adjustments if at
any time the Company's debt rating increases to A3 and A- for Moody's and S&P, respectively.

On
January 15, 2009, TIFSA made a payment of $215 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes, due 2009 which matured on the same date. Additionally, in
November 2008, TIFSA made a payment of $300 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2008.

Other Debt Information

The aggregate amounts of principal debt, including capital leases, maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows ($
in millions): $537 in 2011, $5 in 2012, $5 in 2013, $662 in 2014, $506 in 2015 and $2,414 thereafter.

The
weighted-average interest rate on total debt was 6.3% and 6.6% as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, excluding the impact of interest rate
swaps. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt was 6.8% and 0.3% as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009,
respectively. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the Company had swapped an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of fixed
for floating rate debt. The impact of the Company's interest rate swap agreements on reported interest expense was a net decrease of $24 million for 2010, a net decrease of $6 million
for 2009 and was not material for 2008.

12.    Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of
these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and
performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

There
are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax
Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary to
recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, the Company determined the fair value of these
guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present value measurement techniques. Significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes,
assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution. The probability weighted outcomes were discounted using the Company's incremental
borrowing rate. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of guarantees and indemnifications under the Tax Sharing Agreement is $554 million (of which $156 million is included in
accrued and other current liabilities and the remaining amount in other liabilities) on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet

as
of September 24, 2010. The liability was $554 million as of September 25, 2009, which was recorded in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the
fourth quarter of 2010, the Company reclassified $156 million from other liabilities to accrued and other current liabilities as it expects to make a payment within the next twelve months to
Covidien and Tyco Electronics related to resolution of certain IRS audit matters. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See
Note 6.

In
addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and/or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the
Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the
Separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. The Company's obligations were $4 million, which were included in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, with an offset to shareholders' equity on the Separation date.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As
of September 24, 2010, the Company had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $740 million.

The
Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Note 1.

In
2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of
certain O-ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tyco's acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of
charge to property owners. On May 1, 2007, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Company announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. The
Company will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. Settlements during 2010, 2009 and 2008 include cash expenditures of
$10 million, $33 million and $49 million, respectively, related to the VRP. The Company believes the remaining recorded liability is sufficient to cover the cost required to
complete the VRP as of September 24, 2010, which is not material.

13.    Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt and derivative financial instruments. The
fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated book value as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. The fair value of derivative
financial instruments was not material to any of the periods presented. See below for the fair value of investments and Note 11 for debt.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, Tyco is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. The Company's objective for utilizing derivative
financial instruments is to manage these risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company documented the relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items and linked
derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific debt issuances. For transactions designated as hedges, the Company also assessed and documented at the hedge's inception whether the derivatives
used in hedging transactions were effective in offsetting changes in fair values associated with the hedged items. The fair value hedges did not result in any hedge ineffectiveness for the fiscal year
ended September 24, 2010. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments recognized
currently in earnings with the exception of net investment hedges for which changes in fair value are reported in the cumulative
translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedges are effective. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in the Company's Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The derivative financial instruments and impact of such changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments was not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 or Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended September 24, 2010,
September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008.

13.    Financial Instruments (Continued)

Foreign Currency Exposures

The Company manages foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of
forward contracts on foreign currency, which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The objective of those derivatives instruments is to minimize the income statement
impact and potential variability in cash flows associated with intercompany loans and accounts receivable, accounts payable and forecasted transactions that are denominated in certain foreign
currencies. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the total gross notional amount of the Company's foreign exchange contracts was $860 million and $525 million,
respectively. Effective March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Until the last payment is made in February 2011, Tyco intends to make
dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital, denominated in Swiss francs. However, the Company expects to actually pay these dividends in U.S. dollars, based on exchange rates in effect
shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the U.S. dollar
amount required to be paid. The Company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges
of the underlying risk.

During
the third quarter of 2010, the Company hedged its net investment in certain foreign operations through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. The objective is to minimize
the exposure to changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately $255 million as of September 24,
2010. As of September 25, 2009, the Company did not hedge any net investments in foreign operations.

Interest Rate Exposures

The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as
principal counterparties, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. During the third quarter of 2009, first quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into
interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on $1.4 billion, $500 million and $501 million
respectively, of fixed-rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, the Company agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the
difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. In connection with the redemption of all of the 6.375% public notes due 2011 during the
third quarter of 2010, the Company terminated the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the total gross notional amount of the Company's
interest rate swap contracts was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

Commodity Exposures

During fiscal 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting
purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

13.    Financial Instruments (Continued)

Counterparty Credit Risk

The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, the
Company is exposed to losses if the derivative is in an asset position. When the fair value of a derivative instrument is an asset, the counterparty has to pay the Company to settle the contract. This
exposes the Company to credit risk. However, when the fair value of a derivative instrument is a liability, the Company has to pay the counterparty to settle the contract and therefore there is no
counterparty credit risk. Tyco has established policies and procedures to limit the potential for counterparty credit risk, including establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing
the creditworthiness of counterparties.
As a matter of practice, the Company deals with major banks worldwide having long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of A-/A3 or higher. To further reduce the risk of loss,
the Company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with substantially all of its counterparties. Master netting agreements provide protection in
bankruptcy in certain circumstances and, in some cases, enable receivables and payables with the same counterparty to be offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, providing for a more meaningful
balance sheet presentation of credit exposure. The Company's derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be
furnished by the Company or the counterparties.

The
Company's exposure to credit risk associated with its derivative instruments is measured on an individual counterparty basis, as well as by groups of counterparties that share
similar attributes. As of September 24, 2010, the Company was exposed to industry concentration with financial institutions as well as risk of loss if an individual counterparty or issuer
failed to perform its obligations under contractual terms. The maximum amount of loss that the Company would incur as of September 24, 2010 without giving consideration to the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements, was approximately $66 million.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of
information used in developing fair value estimates. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. In cases where two or
more levels of inputs are used to determine fair value, a financial instrument's level is determined based on the lowest level input that is considered significant to the fair value measurement in its
entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are summarized as follows:

•

Level 1—inputs are based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
which are accessible as of the measurement date.

•

Level 2—inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations for the asset or liability that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data
for which the primary inputs are observable, including forward interest rates, yield curves, credit risk and exchange rates.

•

Level 3—inputs for the valuations are unobservable and are based on management's estimates of assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques such as option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.

13.    Financial Instruments (Continued)

Investments

Investments primarily include U.S. government obligations, U.S. government agency securities and corporate debt securities.

When
available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities. Such investments are included in Level 1. When quoted market prices are not
readily available, pricing determinations are made based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information and
benchmark securities. These investments are included in Level 2 and consist primarily of U.S. government agency securities and corporate debt securities.

Derivative Financial Instruments

As described above, under the caption "Derivative Instruments" derivative assets and liabilities consist principally of forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The fair values for these derivative financial instruments are derived from market approach pricing models that take into account the contractual
terms and features of each instrument, forward foreign currency rates for the Company's foreign exchange contracts and yield curves for the Company's interest rate swaps existing at the end of the
period. Valuations are adjusted to reflect creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and the creditworthiness of the Company for liabilities. Such adjustments are based on observable market
evidence and are categorized as Level 2 exposures. Derivative financial instruments are not presented in the following tables as the derivative financial instruments were not material to any of the
periods presented.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following tables present the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 by level within the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the valuation.

The Company had $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion of intercompany loans designated as permanent in nature as of
September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. For the fiscal years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the Company recorded $24 million and
nil, respectively, of cumulative translation loss through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans.

14.    Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has facility, vehicle and equipment leases that expire at various dates through the year 2027. Rental expense under these leases was $375 million, $386 million
and $409 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company also has facility and equipment commitments under capital leases. Following is a schedule of minimum lease payments for

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14.    Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain legal actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under
the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any judgments resulting from the actions subject to the
agreement, which generally relate to legacy matters that are not specific to the business operations of any of the companies. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also provides that the Company
will be responsible for 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of payments to resolve these matters, with costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingencies being shared
equally among the parties. In addition, under the agreement, the Company will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. Additionally, at the time of the Separation, the Company, Covidien and Tyco Electronics agreed to
allocate responsibility for certain legacy tax claims pursuant to the same formula under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6.

Legacy Securities Matters

As previously disclosed, the Company and certain of its officers and directors were subject to a number of lawsuits alleging violations
of federal and state securities laws and related claims. Since June 2007, the Company has resolved substantially all of these claims, although a number of matters have not reached final
resolution. The most significant of these is the previously disclosed settlement for $79 million of the

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd.

matter

,

a class action lawsuit arising from Tyco's July 2000 initial public offering of common stock of TyCom Ltd. The settlement received final
court approval on August 25, 2010 from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, although certain contingencies for the matter will remain outstanding until the end of
calendar year 2010. The settlement is subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Covidien and Tyco Electronics. The Company believes its remaining
reserve related to legacy securities matters is sufficient to satisfy the final resolution of this matter.

Tyco
is also a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management, among which are affirmative cases brought by Tyco against Mr. Dennis L. Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief
executive officer, Mr. Mark Swartz, its former chief financial officer, and Mr. Frank Walsh Jr., a former director. In connection with these affirmative actions, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz are
seeking an aggregate of approximately $128 million allegedly due in connection with their compensation and retention arrangements and under ERISA, and Mr. Walsh has made claims alleging that
Tyco is required to indemnify him for his defense costs and settlement amounts paid by him in connection with securities lawsuits and arising from his role as a Tyco director. Tyco intends to
vigorously defend each of these actions. In October 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Tyco's affirmative claims for indemnification against Mr. Walsh.
Tyco intends to appeal this decision. Mr. Walsh's claims against Tyco remain outstanding.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14.    Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Tyco
has reserved its best estimate of probable loss for these matters, and although their ultimate resolution could differ materially from these estimates, the Company does not believe
such resolution would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental Matters

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The
ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative
cleanup methods. As of September 24, 2010, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $27 million to $85 million. As of
September 24, 2010, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $34 million, of which $18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities
and $16 million is included in other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters, the Company
believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Tyco
has recorded asset retirement obligations ("AROs") for the estimated future costs associated with legal obligations to retire certain assets. As of September 24, 2010 and
September 25, 2009, the Company's AROs were $10 million and $11 million, respectively. The Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos Matters

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits
based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial
products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos-containing components manufactured by third-parties. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate
defendants. While the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years, including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma-related claims, a large
percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and, as a result, have been dismissed by the courts. The Company's strategy has been, and continues to be, to mount a vigorous defense
aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed, and, where appropriate, settling suits before trial. Although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed, the Company cannot predict the
extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future. Of the lawsuits that have proceeded to trial since 2005, the Company has won or settled all but one case, with that one case
returning an adverse jury verdict for approximately $7.7 million, which included both compensatory and punitive damages. The Company recently settled the matter while its appeal was pending for
significantly less than the amount awarded by the jury. As of September 24, 2010, there were approximately 3,500 lawsuits pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. Each lawsuit
typically includes several claims, and the Company has determined that there were approximately 4,700 claims outstanding as of September 24, 2010, which amount reflects the Company's current
estimate of the number of active claims made against it or its affiliates, and includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted, identify incorrect defendants or are duplicative
of other actions.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14.    Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Annually,
the Company performs a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to update its estimated asbestos-related assets and liabilities. Due to
the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, the Company uses multiple estimation methodologies based on
varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is
predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on an
undiscounted basis. The Company has concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the
projection period lengthens. The Company's estimate of asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable
reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers a number of factors, including available
insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and
creditworthiness of the insurers. On a quarterly basis, the company re-evaluates the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and records an expense as necessary to reflect changes in its
estimated liability and related insurance asset.

The
Company performed its annual analysis of asbestos-related liabilities and insurance assets during the third quarter of 2010. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company settled a
higher than expected number of claims at above average amounts as compared to the estimates used during the Company's valuation performed during fiscal 2009. Based on the Company's claim experience
over the past 5 years, including the impact of the above mentioned increase in settlements and average settlement amounts during fiscal 2010, the Company increased its estimated net liability, which
resulted in the Company recording a net charge of approximately $52 million during the third quarter of 2010. As of September 24, 2010, the Company's estimated net liability of
$106 million was recorded within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of $309 million, and separately as an
asset for insurance recoveries of $203 million. Similarly, as of September 25, 2009, the Company's estimated net liability of $49 million was recorded within the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of $240 million, and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of $191 million.
The estimated insurance asset increased due to the responsiveness of pertinent insurance policies that cover a portion of the increased liability.

The
amounts recorded by the Company for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on currently available information as well as estimates and assumptions. Key
variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year, the average cost of resolution of claims, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers,
amount of available insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the Company's insurance carriers. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the
later portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect the Company's liability and cash payments for asbestos-related matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries. The Company believes that its
asbestos-related reserves as of September 24, 2010 are appropriate. However, actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be

significantly
higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the Company's calculations vary significantly from actual results.

Compliance Matters

As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, the Company has received and responded to various allegations and other
information that certain improper payments were made by the Company's subsidiaries and agents in recent years. For example, two
subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business in Italy have been charged, along with numerous other parties, in connection with the Milan public prosecutor's investigation into allegedly
improper payments made to certain Italian entities, and the Company has reported to German authorities potentially improper conduct involving agents retained by the Company's EMEA water business. The
Company has since resolved this matter with German authorities while the Italian matter remains outstanding. The Company reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the
investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to these and other allegations and its internal investigations. In 2005, the Company informed the DOJ and the SEC that it
retained outside counsel to perform a Company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and that it would
continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies. The Company has and will continue to communicate with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review and
follow-up investigations, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper conduct identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance
activities. The baseline review, which has been completed, has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements, and in February 2010, the Company initiated
discussions with the DOJ and SEC aimed at resolving these matters. Active discussions remain ongoing, and the Company cannot predict the timing of their resolution or their outcome and cannot estimate
the range of potential loss or the form of penalty that may result from an adverse resolution. It is possible that the Company may be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future
conduct, consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants, each of
which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Covidien
and Tyco Electronics agreed, in connection with the Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its responses regarding these matters. Any judgment required to be paid or
settlement or other cost incurred by the Company in connection with the FCPA investigations matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement,
which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former Healthcare and Electronics businesses of the Company to Covidien and Tyco Electronics, respectively, and provides that the Company will
retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations. Any liabilities not primarily related to a particular segment will be shared equally among the Company, Covidien and Tyco
Electronics.

As
previously disclosed, in early 2007 certain former subsidiaries in the Company's Flow Control business were charged by the German Federal Cartel Office ("FCO") with engaging in
anti-competitive practices, in particular with regard to its hydrant, valve, street box and fittings business. The Company investigated this matter and determined that the conduct may have violated
German anti-trust law. The Company is cooperating with the FCO in its ongoing investigation of this violation. The Company cannot estimate the range of potential loss that may result from this
violation. It is possible that the

may be subject to civil or criminal proceedings and may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

ERISA Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessment and Demand

On June 8, 2007, SimplexGrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the National Automatic
Sprinkler Industry Pension Fund (the "Fund"). Under Title IV of ERISA, if the Fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan such as the Fund, the
employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. The alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between Grinnell Fire
Protection Systems, SimplexGrinnell's predecessor, and Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669.

ERISA
requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan. A plan's assessment of
withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration, and ERISA requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration. If the employer
prevails in arbitration (and any subsequent appeals), its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest. The Fund's total withdrawal liability assessment against SimplexGrinnell
is approximately $25 million. The quarterly withdrawal liability payments are $1.1 million, $14.3 million of which has been cumulatively paid through September 24, 2010.
While the ultimate outcome is uncertain, SimplexGrinnell believes that it has strong arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the Fund, and it plans to vigorously defend against the Fund's
withdrawal liability assessment. The matter is currently in arbitration. The Company has made no provision for this contingency and believes that its quarterly payments are recoverable.

Broadview Security Contingency

On May 14, 2010, the Company acquired Broadview Security, which is a business that was formerly owned by The Brink's Company.
Under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, as amended (the "Coal Act"), The Brink's Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries at July 20, 1992 (including certain legal
entities acquired in the Broadview Security acquisition) are jointly and severally liable with certain of The Brink's Company's other current and former subsidiaries for health care coverage
obligations provided for by the Coal Act. A Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Associate ("VEBA") trust has been established by The Brink's Company to pay for these liabilities, although the trust may
have insufficient funds to satisfy all future obligations. At the time of its spin-off from The Brink's Company, Broadview Security entered into an agreement in which The Brink's Company agreed to
indemnify Broadview Security for any and all liabilities and expenses related to The Brink's Company's former coal operations, including any health care coverage obligations. The Brink's Company has
agreed that this indemnification survives the Company's acquisition of Broadview Security. The Company has evaluated its potential liability under the Coal Act as a contingency in light of all known
facts, including the funding of the VEBA, and indemnification provided by The Brinks Company. The Company has concluded that no accrual is necessary due to the existence of the indemnification and its
belief that The Brink's Company and the VEBA will be able to satisfy all future obligations under the Coal Act.

Other Matters

As previously reported, in 2002, the SEC's Division of Enforcement conducted an investigation related to past accounting practices for
dealer connect fees that ADT had charged to its authorized dealers upon purchasing customer accounts. The investigation related to accounting practices employed by the Company's former management,
which were discontinued in 2003. Although the Company settled with the SEC in 2006, a number of former dealers and related parties have filed lawsuits against the Company, including a class action
lawsuit filed in the District Court of Arapahoe County, Colorado, alleging breach of contract and other claims related to ADT's decision to terminate certain authorized dealers in 2002 and 2003. In
February 2010, the Court granted a directed verdict in ADT's favor dismissing a number of the plaintiffs' key claims. The plaintiffs have appealed this verdict. While it is not possible at this
time to predict the final outcome of these lawsuits, the Company does not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In
addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to claims and suits, including from time to time, contractual disputes and product and general liability claims, incidental to
present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. With respect to many of these claims, the Company either self-insures or maintains insurance through third-parties, with varying
deductibles. While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of any such proceedings, whether the underlying claims are covered
by insurance or not, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows beyond amounts recorded for such matters.

Income Tax Matter

15.    Retirement Plans

The Company sponsors a number of pension plans. The Company measures its pension plans as of its fiscal year end. The following disclosures exclude the impact of plans which are
immaterial individually and in the aggregate.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of its
U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations which use the
projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants.
Contribution amounts are determined based on local regulations and the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based
on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.

During
the third quarter of 2010, the Company adopted plan amendments that froze pension plan benefits for certain of its defined benefit arrangements in the United Kingdom, which
resulted in the Company recognizing a curtailment gain of approximately $22 million in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For inactive
plans the Company will amortize its actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy of the pension plan participants.

The
estimated net loss and prior service cost for U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next
fiscal year are expected to be $12 million and $1 million, respectively.

The
estimated net loss and prior service credit for non-U.S. pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over

In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long-term periods,
asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions.

The
Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to maintain an adequate level of diversification
while maximizing the return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants as well as providing adequate liquidity to
meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. In addition, local regulations and local financial considerations are factors in determining the appropriate investment strategy in each
country. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40% allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S.
pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation is 52% to equity securities, 44% to debt securities and 4% to other asset classes, including real estate and cash equivalents.

Although
the Company does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management in certain commingled funds, the
plans may indirectly hold Tyco securities. The aggregate amount of the securities would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.

The
Company evaluates its defined benefit plans' asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of risk. Types of investment concentration risks that are evaluated
include, but not limited to, concentrations in a single entity, industry, foreign country and individual fund manager. As of September 24, 2010, there were no significant concentrations of risk
in the Company's defined benefit plan assets.

The
Company's plan assets are accounted for at fair value and are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value of assets and their placement within the fair
value hierarchy

Equity
securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. equities. Publicly traded securities are valued at the last trade or closing price reported in the active market
in which the individual securities are traded. Certain equity securities are held within commingled funds which are valued at the unitized net asset value ("NAV") or percentage of the net asset value
as determined by the custodian of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund.

Fixed
income securities consist primarily of government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, and mortgage and other asset-backed securities. When available, fixed income
securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Government and agency securities and corporate debt securities are valued using the
most recent bid prices or occasionally the mean of the latest bid and ask prices when markets are less liquid. Asset-backed securities including mortgage backed securities are valued using
broker/dealer quotes when available. When quotes are not available, fair value is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, which incorporates other observable inputs such as cash flows,
underlying security structure and market information including interest rates and bid evaluations of comparable securities. Certain fixed income securities are held within commingled funds which are
valued utilizing NAV as

determined
by the custodian of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund.

Real
estate investments include publicly traded real estate investment trusts ("REITS") and direct investments in commercial and residential properties. REITS are valued at the last
trade or closing price in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Direct real estate properties are valued using discounted cash flow models which consider long-term lease
estimates, future rental
receipts and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on a periodic basis.

Cash
and cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term commercial paper, bonds and other cash or cash-like instruments including settlement proceeds due from brokers, stated at cost,
which approximates fair value.

The
strategy of the Company's investment managers with regard to the investments valued using NAV or its equivalent is to either match or exceed relevant benchmarks associated with the
respective asset category. None of the investments valued using NAV or its equivalent contain any redemption restrictions or unfunded commitments.

During
2010, the Company contributed $82 million to its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, which represented the Company's minimum required contributions to its pension plans for
fiscal year 2010. The Company did not make any voluntary contributions during 2010 to its U.S. and non-US pension plans.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that it will contribute at least the minimum required to its pension plans in 2011 of $12 million for the U.S. plans and
$52 million for non-U.S. plans. The Company also anticipates making voluntary contributions of approximately $20 million to its U.S. plans during 2011.

$1 million and $1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Executive Retirement Arrangements

—Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz participated in individual Executive Retirement Arrangements maintained by Tyco (the
"ERA"). Under the ERA, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz would have fixed lifetime benefits commencing at their normal retirement age of 65. The Company's accrued benefit obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski
and Swartz as of September 24, 2010 were $87 million and $45 million, respectively. The Company's accrued benefit obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of
September 25, 2009 were $81 million and $42 million, respectively. Retirement benefits are available at earlier ages and alternative forms of benefits can be elected. Any such
variations would be actuarially equivalent to the fixed lifetime benefit starting at age 65. Amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz under the ERA are the subject of litigation brought by the
Company against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

—The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include 401(k) matching programs, as
well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was
$81 million, $79 million and $84 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company also maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). This plan
is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to IRS limits on eligible compensation under the defined contribution plans which did not have a material impact in
2010, 2009 and 2008.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their
compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds
correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation liabilities were $108 million
and $97 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. Deferred compensation expense was not material for 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

—The Company generally does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions for its employees. However, certain
acquired operations provide these benefits to employees who were eligible at the date of acquisition, and a small number of U.S. and Canadian operations provide ongoing eligibility for such benefits.

Dividends

Pursuant to Swiss law, dividend payments made prior to January 1, 2011 are subject to Swiss withholding taxes unless made in the
form of a return of capital from the Company's registered share capital. As a result, the Company intends to first pay dividends in the form of a reduction of registered share capital until at least
January 1, 2011. After the last dividend payment is made out of registered capital in February 2011, the Company expects to make dividend payments in
the form of a reduction in contributed surplus, which are also expected to be made free of Swiss withholding taxes.

On
March 10, 2010, the Company's shareholders approved an annual dividend on the Company's common shares of CHF 0.90 per share, which is being paid in the form of a return
on capital in four installments of CHF 0.22 in May 2010, CHF 0.22 in August 2010, CHF 0.23 in November 2010 and CHF 0.23 in February 2011. The
installments will be paid in U.S. dollars converted from Swiss Francs at the USD/CHF exchange rate in effect shortly before the payment dates. The first three installments of the annual
dividend were or will be paid on May 26, 2010, August 25, 2010 and November 23, 2010. While certain administrative steps need to occur to effectuate the dividend payment, approval
of the dividend by the shareholders establishes the dividend under Swiss law. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 428 million as of March 10, 2010, which
approximated $399 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. The accrued dividend was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of March 26, 2010. On the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, this amount was recorded as a reduction of

common
shares, which reduces the par value of the Company's common shares from CHF 7.60 to CHF 6.70.

On
May 14, 2010, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of Broadview Security. Broadview Security shareholders who received Tyco common stock as consideration in the
merger were included in the first installment of dividend payments that were paid on May 26, 2010. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 32 million as of
May 14, 2010, which was approximately $28 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date.

On
March 12, 2009, the Company's shareholders approved an annual dividend on the Company's common shares of CHF 0.93 per share, which was paid in the form of a return on
capital in four installments of CHF 0.23, CHF 0.23, CHF 0.23 and CHF 0.24 on May 27, 2009, August 26, 2009, November 24, 2009 and February 24,
2010, respectively. The Company recorded an accrued dividend of CHF 440 million as of March 12, 2009, which approximated $377 million based on the exchange rate in effect
on that date. On the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, this amount was recorded as a reduction of common shares, which reduced the par value of the Company's common shares from CHF 8.53 to
CHF 7.60. The installments were paid in U.S. dollars converted from Swiss Francs at the USD/CHF exchange rate in effect shortly before the payment dates.

to the Change of Domicile, on December 4, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common shares of $0.20 per share, which was
paid on February 2, 2009. This amount was recorded as a reduction of accumulated earnings.

Common Stock

As of September 24, 2010, the Company's share capital amounted to CHF 3,683,470,241, or 514,451,151 registered common
shares with a par value of CHF 7.16 per share. Until March 12, 2011, the Board of Directors may increase the Company's share capital by a maximum amount of CHF 1,464,159,140 by
issuing a maximum of 204,491,500 shares. In addition, until March 12, 2011, (i) the share capital of the Company may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 343,175,292
through the issue of a maximum of 47,929,510 shares through the exercise of conversion and/or option or warrant rights granted in connection with bonds, notes or similar instruments including
convertible debt instruments and (ii) the share capital of the Company may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 343,175,292 through the issue of a maximum of 47,929,510 shares to
employees and other persons providing services to the Company. Although the Company states its par value in Swiss francs it continues to use the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency for preparing its
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Change in Domicile

Effective March 17, 2009, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to the Canton of Schaffhausen,
Switzerland. In connection with the Change of Domicile and pursuant to the laws of Switzerland, the par value of the Company's common shares increased from $0.80 per share to 8.53 Swiss Francs (CHF)
per share (or $7.21 based on the exchange rate in effect on March 17, 2009). The Change of Domicile was approved at a special general meeting of shareholders held on

March 12,
2009. The following steps occurred in connection with the Change of Domicile, which did not result in a change to total Shareholders' Equity:

(1)

approximately
21 million shares held directly or indirectly in treasury were cancelled;

(2)

the
par value of common shares of the Company was increased from $0.80 to CHF 8.53 through an approximate 1-for-9 reverse share split, followed by
the issuance of approximately eight fully paid up shares so that the same number of shares were outstanding before and after the Change of Domicile, which reduced share premium and increased common
shares; and

(3)

the
remaining amount of share premium was eliminated with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus.

Share Repurchase Program

The Company's Board of Directors approved the $1.0 billion 2010 Share Repurchase Program, $1.0 billion 2008 Share
Repurchase Program and the $1.0 billion 2007 Share Repurchase Program, in September 2010, July 2008 and September 2007, respectively. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased
approximately 24 million shares for approximately $900 million under the 2008 share repurchase program, which reduced the amount of common shares outstanding and decreased the dividends
declared on the consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity as of September 24, 2010. The following table represents the number of shares and dollar amount of repurchases made under each of
the Company's repurchase programs by fiscal year and the remaining amount available for repurchase as of September 24, 2010:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17.    Share Plans (Continued)

During
2004, the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") effectively replaced the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended as of
May 12, 1999 (the "LTIP I Plan") and the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan") for all awards effective on and after March 25, 2004. The 2004 Plan
provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long term performance awards, restricted units, restricted shares, deferred stock units, promissory
stock and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards").

The
2004 Plan provides for a maximum of 40 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan. In addition, any
common shares that have been approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the LTIP Plans but which have not been awarded thereunder as of January 1, 2004, reduced by the number of
common shares related to Awards made under the LTIP Plans between January 1, 2004 and March 25, 2004, the date the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, (or which have been awarded but
will not be issued, owing to expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004) and which are no longer
available for any reason (including the termination of the LTIP Plans) will also be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. When common shares are issued pursuant to a grant of a full value Award
(restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs), the total number of common shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per common share issued. As of September 24,
2010, there were approximately 22 million shares available for future grant under the 2004 Plan. As of September 24, 2010, 17 million shares had been granted under the 2004 Plan.

The
LTIP I Plan reserved common shares for issuance to Tyco's directors, executives and managers as share options. During 2010, there were approximately 0.3 million shares
originally reserved for issuance under this plan, that became available for future grant under the 2004 Plan due to expiration, forfeiture or cancellation. As of September 24, 2010,
2.8 million options remained outstanding which were granted under the LTIP prior to its termination.

The
LTIP II Plan was a broad-based option plan for non-officer employees. The terms and conditions of this plan were similar to the LTIP I Plan. During 2010, there were approximately
1 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan, that became available for future grant under the 2004 Plan due to expiration, forfeiture or cancellation. As of
September 24, 2010, 3.3 million options remained outstanding which were granted under the LTIP II prior to its termination.

Share Options

—Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices that are equal to or greater than the closing market price of the common shares
on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four
years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. Historically, the Company's practice has been to settle stock option exercises through either newly issued shares or from shares held
in treasury.

The
grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility
is calculated based on an analysis of historic and implied volatility measures for a set of peer companies. The average expected

life
is based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary
termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual share option forfeitures. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

—Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S.
subsidiaries were eligible to participate in an employee share purchase plan ("ESPP"). Eligible employees authorized payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. The Company matched a
portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All shares purchased under the plan were purchased on the open market by a designated
broker. The ESPP was suspended indefinitely during the quarter ended September 25, 2009.

Under
the SAYE Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom were granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of
grant. Options under the SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. The SAYE Plan provided for a maximum of 10 million
common shares to be issued. All of the shares purchased under the SAYE Plan were purchased on the open market. The SAYE Plan was approved on November 3, 1999 for a ten year period and expired
according to its terms on November 3, 2009. The International Benefits Oversight Committee has not approved any additional grants since the last annual grant on October 9, 2008 and it
has not applied for approval of a replacement for the SAYE Plan at this time.

.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted under the SAYE Plan during 2009 and 2008 were $3.47 and $14.18, respectively. There were no options granted under the SAYE
Plan during 2010. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $1 million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively. The related excess cash tax
benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was not significant. As of September 24, 2010, there was $0.1 million in total unrecognized compensation cost
related to non-vested options granted under the SAYE Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 1 year.

Restricted Share Awards

—Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant
under the 2004 Plan. Restrictions on the award generally lapse upon normal retirement, if more than twelve months from the grant date, death or disability of the employee.

The
fair market value of restricted awards, both time vesting and those subject to specific performance criteria, are expensed over the period of vesting. Restricted share awards that
vest based upon passage of time generally vest over a period of four years. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's shares on the
grant date.



TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17.    Share Plans (Continued)

Restricted
share awards that vest dependent upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels generally vest in their entirety three years from the grant date. The
fair value of performance share awards is determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation model. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.

The
Company generally grants restricted stock units. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalent units. Recipients of performance shares
have no voting rights and may receive dividend equivalent units depending on the terms of the grant.

As
of September 24, 2010, there was $89 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to both non-vested restricted share awards and performance shares. That cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 fiscal years.

Deferred Stock Units

—Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco common shares with distribution deferred
until termination of employment or service to the Company. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the
fair value of DSUs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the
right to vote and receive cash dividends. However, they

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

have
the right to receive dividend equivalent units. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Under the 2004 Plan, grants made to executives generally vested in equal annual
installments over three years while DSUs granted to the Board of Directors were immediately vested. The Company has granted 1 million DSUs, the majority of which were outstanding as of
September 24, 2010.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of DSUs granted during 2009 and 2008 was $34.09 and $44.96, respectively. There were no DSU awards granted during 2010. The total fair value of
DSUs vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $1 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively. As of September 24, 2010, all DSUs are vested.

assets are comprised primarily of property, plant and equipment and exclude goodwill, other intangible assets, deferred taxes and
other shared assets.

During the first quarter of 2011, the Company will realign its Safety Products segment between its ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments. The
Company's existing ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments will create two new businesses: Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection.

Tyco
Security Solutions will consist of the Company's ADT Worldwide segment as well as manufacturing security products including intrusion, security, access control and video management
systems previously manufactured by its Safety Products segment. Tyco Fire Protection will consist of its Fire Protection segment as well as a number of businesses in its Safety Products segment
including its fire suppression and building products and life safety products businesses.

As
a result of this realignment, as well as the planned sale of a 51% interest of the Company's Electrical and Metal Products business (see Note 25), the Company will have three
core businesses: Tyco Security Solutions, Tyco Fire Protection and Flow Control.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

24.    Tyco International Finance S.A.

TIFSA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has public debt securities outstanding (see Note 11) which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco. The following tables
present condensed consolidating financial information for Tyco, TIFSA and all other subsidiaries. Condensed financial information for Tyco and TIFSA on a stand-alone basis is presented using the
equity method of accounting for subsidiaries.

During
the second quarter of 2008, the Company completed a tax-free restructuring involving the transfer of certain investments from Tyco to TIFSA. Since the transactions were entirely
among wholly-owned subsidiaries of Tyco, there was no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The transactions did, however, result in an increase
to TIFSA's investment in subsidiaries of $1.9 billion. Since these transactions were among entities under common control, their effects have been reflected as of the beginning of the earliest
period presented.

25.    Subsequent Events

On September 30, 2010, the Company received the necessary consents and approval to complete the sale of its European water business and received net cash proceeds of approximately
$267 million. The Company expects to recognize a gain on the transaction.

Consistent
with its annual equity compensation practices, on October 12, 2010, the Company granted Tyco employees 3.9 million share options with a weighted-average
grant-date fair value of $9.13 per share at the date of grant. Additionally, the Company granted 1.4 million and 0.6 million restricted stock units and performance share units with a
fair value of $37.29 and $41.17 per share on the date of grant, respectively.

On
November 9, 2010, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement to sell a 51% interest in its Electrical and Metal Products business to an affiliate of the private
equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the "Investor"). The Company will form a newly incorporated holding company, Atkore, to hold the Company's Electrical and Metal Products
business. Upon closing, Tyco is expected to receive total cash proceeds of approximately $720 million and anticipates recognizing a gain on the transaction. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement
entered into in connection with the transaction, Tyco and its affiliates have agreed to sell shares of a newly-created class of cumulative convertible preferred stock of Atkore (the "Preferred Stock")
to the Investor for $306 million. The preferred stock to be sold to Investor will initially represent 51% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Atkore
immediately following the closing. Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, it is anticipated that Atkore will incur new third party indebtedness of up to $465 million and use such proceeds
in part to repay approximately $400 million in intercompany indebtedness to subsidiaries of Tyco. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and is expected
to close in the first half of fiscal 2011. The Company will continue to present Atkore in continuing operations. Upon completion of the transaction, Tyco's ownership interest in Atkore will be
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
