General

Tyco International Ltd. ("we," "Tyco" or the "Company") is a diversified manufacturing and service company that, through its subsidiaries:

•

designs,
manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems;

•

designs,
manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components;

•

designs,
manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and

•

designs,
manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides consulting,
engineering and construction management and operating services.

Tyco
International Ltd., which is organized under the laws of Bermuda, was created as a result of the July 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a
Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited, a public company organized under the laws of Bermuda in the 1980's with origins dating back to the United Kingdom since the early 1900's, at which time ADT
Limited changed its name to Tyco International Ltd.

Unless
otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2005, 2004 and 2003 are to Tyco's fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Strategy

Tyco's operating strategy is to be a high-quality, low-cost producer and provider in each of the markets we serve. We promote our
leadership positions by investing in existing businesses and developing new markets. Our current business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco
businesses, and we plan to achieve this goal primarily through new product innovation, increased market share, and continued geographic expansion. We have implemented and will continue to implement
additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments to achieve best-in-class operating practices. We strive to increase the value of our Company and our global
portfolio of diversified brands by exceeding customers' expectations and by achieving market leadership and operating excellence in every segment. We are also committed to being a leader in corporate
governance so that we can continue to earn the respect and confidence of our shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers as well as the financial community.

Leveraging
the strengths of our existing operations, we seek to enhance value for our shareholders through operational excellence and maximization of cash flows. We plan to use available
cash to continue to fund internal growth and cost reduction opportunities within our businesses. Additionally, we believe that our cash flow generation capability will allow us to continue to
strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. While debt reduction and share repurchase are our focus in the near term, we will also consider appropriate acquisitions should the
opportunity arise.

We
continue to pursue the divestiture of certain non-core businesses and may also consider actions that would alter the current operating structure of the Company. During the
year, we divested eighteen businesses, including the sale of the Tyco Global Network ("TGN"), our undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. Additionally, during 2005, we committed to a plan to
divest our Plastics & Adhesives segment, a global manufacturer of plastic film, specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products


and
garment hangers, and accordingly, its operations are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating Segments

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain segment and geographic financial data relating to our business.

I.     Fire and Security

Tyco is the world's leading provider of both electronic security services and fire protection services. With 2005 net revenue of $11.5 billion, our Fire
and Security businesses comprise 29% of our consolidated net revenue. In 2004 and 2003, net revenue totaled $11.5 billion or 30% of our consolidated net revenue and $10.9 billion or 32%
of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. The group's products and services include:

•

designing,
manufacturing, installing, monitoring and servicing electronic security systems;

•

designing,
manufacturing, installing and servicing a broad line of fire detection systems and suppression systems, and manufacturing and servicing fire extinguishers and
related products; and

•

providing
integrated systems for surveillance and control of public transportation systems, bridges, tunnels and other public works.

Tyco
Fire and Security consists of two reporting units: Electronic Security Services and Fire Protection Contracting and Services.

Electronic Security Services

We are the world's leading provider of electronic security products and services and event monitoring, which includes the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire
alarms, medical alert systems, such as our Personal Emergency Response Systems, and other activities where around-the-clock monitoring and response are required. We offer
regular inspection and maintenance services to ensure that systems will function properly and can be upgraded as technology or risk profiles change. We are also a leading supplier of electronic
security solutions to the retail, commercial and industrial marketplaces, offering anti-theft, video surveillance, access control, electronic asset protection and security management
systems, products and services. These and other security services are provided principally through our ADT operating companies.

Electronically
monitored security systems are tailored to our customers' specific needs and involve the installation and use on a customer's premises of devices designed for intrusion
detection and access control, as well as reaction to various occurrences or conditions, such as movement, fire, smoke, flooding, environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These
detection devices are connected to microprocessor-based control panels, which communicate to a monitoring center (located remotely from the customer's premises) where alarm and supervisory signals are
received and recorded. In most systems, control panels can identify the nature of the alarm and the areas within a building where the sensor was activated. Depending upon the type of service for which
the subscriber has contracted, monitoring center personnel respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to the local fire or police departments, notifying the customer or taking other
appropriate action, such as dispatching employees to the customer's premises. In some instances, the customer may monitor the system at its own premises or the system may be connected to local fire or
police departments.


Whether
systems are monitored by the customer at its premises or connected to one of our monitoring centers, we usually provide support and maintenance through service contracts. Systems
installed at customers' premises may be owned by us or by our customers.

We
market our electronic security services to commercial and residential customers through both a direct sales force and an authorized dealer network. A separate national accounts sales
force services large commercial customers. We also utilize advertising and direct mail to market our services.

We
provide residential electronic security services primarily in North America, Latin America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. Our commercial customers
include financial institutions, industrial and commercial businesses, federal, state and local governments, defense installations, and health care and educational facilities. Our customers are often
prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition
to coverage. It has been our experience that the majority of commercial and residential monitoring contracts are renewed after their initial terms. In general, relocations account for the largest
number of residential discontinuances while business closures comprise the largest single factor impacting commercial contract attrition.

We
are the leader in anti-theft systems. The majority of the world's leading retailers use our systems to protect against shoplifting and employee theft. We manufacture these
SENSORMATIC electronic article surveillance systems and generally sell them through our direct sales force in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and South Africa. A growing trend in the
loss protection industry is for security labels to be applied to goods at the point of manufacture. In most cases, we sell these labels directly to the manufacturers or their packaging agents. We also
develop and distribute access control and video surveillance systems, which are sold through direct and distributor channels.

We
manufacture certain alarm, detection and activation devices and central monitoring station equipment both for installation by us and for sale to other installers, although we
outsource some of the electronic components we install.

The
security business in North America is highly competitive, with a number of major firms and some 14,000 smaller regional and local companies. Similarly, Tyco competes with several
national companies and several thousand regional and local companies in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and South Africa. Competition is based primarily on price in relation
to quality of service. We believe that the quality of our electronic security service is higher than that of many of our competitors and, therefore, our prices may be higher than those charged by our
competitors.

Fire Protection Contracting and Services

We design, fabricate, install and service automatic fire sprinkler systems, fire alarm and detection systems and special hazard suppression systems in buildings,
industrial plants and off-shore installations, as well as respiratory systems and other life-saving devices. Tyco's fire protection businesses utilize a worldwide network of
sales offices, operating globally under various trade names including SIMPLEXGRINNELL, WORMALD, MATHER & PLATT, TOTAL WALTHER, DONG BANG, ZETTLER, ANSUL, SCOTT and TYCO.

We
install fire protection systems in both new and existing buildings. Our fire protection systems are purchased by owners, construction engineers and mechanical or general contractors.
In recent years, the retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire protection systems, especially in hotels, healthcare facilities,
educational establishments and other buildings accessible to the general public. We continue to focus on system maintenance and inspection, which have become more significant parts of our business.

The
majority of the fire suppression systems installed by Tyco are water-based. However, we are also the world's leading provider of custom designed special hazard fire protection
systems which


incorporate
specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases, in addition to spill control products designed to absorb, neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous materials.
These systems are often especially suited to fire protection in certain manufacturing, power generation, petrochemical, offshore oil exploration, transportation, data processing, telecommunications,
commercial food preparation, mining and marine applications.

We
manufacture and distribute SCOTT and SABRE breathing systems for use by firefighters and other first responders and for industrial applications. Military forces from 25 countries use
our breathing apparatus and more than half a million U.S. firefighters rely on our SCOTT AIR-PAK brand of self-contained breathing apparatus. SCOTT and SABRE products are sold
globally through a network of distributors. SCOTT is considered the world leader in respiratory protection innovation for first responders.

In
Asia and Europe, Tyco designs, installs and maintains integrated systems which monitor and manage urban traffic control systems, as well as lighting, ventilation, fire detection,
surveillance and traffic control for bridges, tunnels, railways and mines.

The
majority of the mechanical components (and, in North America, a high proportion of the pipe) used in our fire protection systems are manufactured by Tyco Engineered Products and
Services. We use computer-aided-design technology that reduces the time required to design systems for specific applications and coordinates the fabrication and delivery of system components. We also
have fabrication plants that cut, thread and weld pipe, which is then shipped with other prefabricated components to job sites for installation.

Competition
in the fire protection contracting business varies by region. In North America, Tyco competes with hundreds of smaller contractors on a regional or local basis for the
installation of fire protection, alarm and detection systems. In Europe, Tyco competes with many regional or local contractors on a country-by-country basis. In Australia, New
Zealand and Asia, we compete with a few large fire protection contractors, as well as with many smaller regional or
local companies. Tyco competes for fire protection systems contracts primarily on the basis of price, service and quality.

II.    Electronics

Tyco is the world's leading supplier of passive electronic components. With 2005, 2004 and 2003 net revenue of $12.2 billion, $11.8 billion and
$10.5 billion, respectively, our Electronics businesses comprised 31% of our consolidated net revenue in each year. The group's products and services include:

•

designing,
engineering and manufacturing electronic/electrical connector systems, fiber optic components, wireless devices including private radio systems and radar sensors,
heat shrink products, circuit protection devices, magnetic devices, wire and cable, relays, sensors, touch screens, identification and labeling products, power systems and components, printed circuit
boards and assemblies, electronic modules, application tooling, switches and battery assemblies.

Tyco
Electronics consists of five reporting units: Electronic Components, Wireless, Power Systems, Printed Circuit Group and Submarine Telecommunications.

With
the exception of Submarine Telecommunications, these businesses design, manufacture and market a broad range of electronic, electrical and electro-optic passive and active devices
and a number of interconnection systems and connector-intensive assemblies, as well as wireless products including radar sensors, global positioning satellite systems components, private radio
systems, silicon and gallium arsenide semiconductors and microwave sub-systems. These products have potential uses wherever an electronic, electrical, computer or telecommunications system
is involved. Tyco Electronics manufactures and sells more than 500,000 parts. Products are sold under the AMP, AGASTAT,


AXICOM,
AUGAT, CRITCHLEY, DULMISON, ELO-TOUCH SYSTEMS, M/A-COM, POTTER & BRUMFIELD, RAYCHEM and TYCO ELECTRONICS trade names, among others.

Sales
and marketing are done via direct sales and distributors to customers including original equipment manufacturers and their subcontractors, utilities, government agencies,
value-added resellers and those who install, maintain and repair equipment. In 2005, the group's direct sales represented 86% of net revenue while the remaining net revenue was via distributors. Their
customers are found in the automotive, communications equipment manufacturing, telecommunications service, computer,
aerospace, military, household appliance, industrial machinery and equipment, instrumentation, consumer electronics, energy and networking industries. In total, these businesses serve over 250,000
customers located in over 55 countries and maintain a strong local presence in the geographic areas in which they operate, including the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa and the
Asia-Pacific region.

Tyco
Submarine Telecommunications is a leading provider of services for undersea fiber optic networks. Tyco Submarine Telecommunications' products and services include: designing,
manufacturing and installing undersea cable communications systems and servicing and maintaining major undersea cable networks.

Tyco
Electronics operates in highly competitive markets. The competition experienced across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to
small, highly specialized manufacturers. Competition is on the basis of breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality and service.

III.  Healthcare

Tyco is a global leader in the medical products industry. With 2005, 2004 and 2003 net revenue of $9.5 billion, $9.1 billion and
$8.4 billion, respectively, our Healthcare businesses comprised 24% of our consolidated net revenue in each year. The group's products include:

Raw and Other Purchased Materials

We are a large buyer of steel and resin in the United States. We are also a large buyer of copper, brass, gold, electronic components, chemicals and additives,
thin and flexible copper clad materials, zinc, paper, ink, foil, adhesives, cloth, wax, pulp and cotton. Certain of the components used in the Fire Protection business, principally certain valves and
fittings, are purchased for installation in fire protection systems or for distribution. Materials are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. There have been no
shortages in materials which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. However, significant increases in certain raw material costs may have an adverse impact on costs and operating
margins. We enter into long-term supply contracts, using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions.

Patents and Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, which principally relate to electrical and electronic products, healthcare products, fire protection devices, electronic security
systems, flow control products, tubing and building and cable products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products
extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially
extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. All capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, the Company
or its subsidiaries. Although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future, in the opinion of management the loss of any single patent or trademark would not
materially affect the conduct of the business in any of our segments.

Employees

Tyco employed 247,900 people at September 30, 2005, of which 89,000 are employed in the United States and 158,900 are outside the United States. We have
collective bargaining agreements with labor unions covering 36,900 employees at certain of our North American, European and Asia-Pacific businesses. We believe that our relations with the
labor unions are generally good.

In
April 1994, following lengthy contract talks with the Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669, our Grinnell subsidiary declared that negotiations were at an impasse
and implemented its last best and final offer. Employees in those locations, representing 64% of Grinnell Fire Protection's North American union employees at the time (approximately 1,200 employees),
went on strike. In January 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit determined that while Grinnell had acted in good faith, the Company should not have declared an
impasse. The court ordered the reinstatement of the terms of the 1994 collective bargaining agreement, instructed the Company to compensate any employees affected by the Company's decision to declare
an impasse and ordered the parties to return to their negotiations. In January 2001 Tyco also acquired Simplex Time Recorder Co. In January 2002, Grinnell Fire Protection and Simplex
Time Recorder Co. began doing business as SimplexGrinnell LP (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco). As instructed by the court, SimplexGrinnell reinstated relevant terms of the 1994 collective
bargaining agreement, made whole any affected employees (approximately 2% of SimplexGrinnell's employee population) and resumed negotiations with Local Union No. 669.

In
late December of 2004, SimplexGrinnell reached an agreement with Local 669 and the United Association, resolving all matters that had been in dispute since 1994. As part of that
agreement, Local 669 acknowledged that it no longer legally represents the employees of SimplexGrinnell.


Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things, the generation,
storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. The cost of compliance with
environmental laws, however, has not had, and based on current information and applicable laws, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions
at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the
cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental
contamination resulting from past operations.

Given
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods, the ultimate cost of cleanup at
disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial
costs in the range of approximately $143 million to $420 million. As of September 30, 2005, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately
$215 million, of which $33 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $182 million is included in other long-term liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $215 million, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are
not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions,
geopolitical events and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our
liquidity.

Risks Relating to Actions of Tyco's Former Senior Corporate Management

Pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.

As
a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of our former senior corporate management, current and former members of our Board of Directors
and our current Chief Executive Officer, Special Advisor to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and current General Counsel are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging
violations of certain disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco, certain of our current and former employees, some members of our former senior corporate management and some former
members of the Board of Directors of Tyco International (US), Inc. also are named as defendants in several ERISA class actions. In addition, Tyco and some members of our former senior corporate
management are subject to an SEC inquiry, and some members of our former senior corporate management are named as defendants in criminal cases prosecuted by the District Attorney of New York County.
The findings and outcomes of the prosecutions and the SEC civil action may affect the course of the purported securities class actions and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco. We are generally
obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are also named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In
addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate
what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate
amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Continued scrutiny resulting from ongoing governmental investigations may have an adverse effect on our business.

We
and others have received subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the District Attorney of New York County, the United States Department of Labor and others
seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. Certain current and former
employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices regarding the ADT dealer connect fees. As previously
reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of our benefit plans. At this time, we cannot
predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to
injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non-governmental customers)
or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot provide assurance that the effects and results of these or other investigations will not be
material and adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

Tyco's
and our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. Tyco is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the years
1997 through 2000. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. We are reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities
and are contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been
accrued through the income tax provision, equity or adjustments to goodwill, as appropriate. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex
tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and
other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We
adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and
circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax
liabilities.

In
connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 through 2000, the Company prepared proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns. The proposed
amendments are currently being reviewed by the IRS and if accepted will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to our net deferred tax assets and liabilities. The
Company is in the process of preparing proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. The proposed amendments are not expected to have a material adverse
impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Ongoing SEC inquiries may require us to further amend or restate our public disclosures.

We
are subject to inquiries by the SEC's Division of Enforcement. We cannot provide assurance that the resolution of the Division of Enforcement's inquiries will not necessitate further
amendments or restatements to our previously-filed periodic reports or lead to some enforcement proceedings against Tyco. The SEC's Division of Enforcement has not completed its review of prior
management's actions and our accounting, including the matters covered by the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 30, 2002.

During
2005, the Company recorded a charge of $50 million, which represents the Company's best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties management believes the Company will
likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SEC's investigation. The Company is engaged in discussions with the SEC's Division of Enforcement to resolve the matters raised in the SEC's
investigation. Final resolution of these matters is subject to a number of uncertainties, including finalizing the terms of a settlement that the Enforcement Staff will agree to recommend to the
Commission, the Company's submission of an offer of settlement approved by the Tyco Board of Directors, and the Commission's approval of the settlement offer. Until such events have occurred, the
charge is subject to change.

Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding
indebtedness.

We
estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. In making this estimate, we
have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with our pending litigation or investigations. Any material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from
our pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the
additional


funding
that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Such
an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

require
us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, including debt reduction or dividend payments;

•

increase
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

•

restrict
our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;

•

make
it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and

•

increase
the difficulty and/or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness.

Additional negative publicity may adversely affect our business.

As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco was the subject of continuing negative publicity focusing on these actions. This
negative publicity contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities in 2002 and brought increased regulatory scrutiny upon us. Additional negative publicity related
to former senior corporate management's actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our publicly traded securities.

Our senior corporate management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management.

We
replaced our senior corporate executives with a new team during 2002 through 2004, and all of the former members of our Board of Directors determined not to stand for reelection in
March 2003. A new Board of Directors was elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2003. We cannot provide assurance that this major restructuring of our Board of
Directors and senior management team, and the accompanying distractions related to matters arising from the actions of prior management will not adversely affect our results of operations.

Risks Relating to Our Businesses

Cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
operating results in some of our segments are affected adversely by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which they operate. For example, demand for the products and
services of Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending. Also, the electronic
components business within Electronics is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand patterns of these markets, which could impact the margins in this
business. This cyclical impact can be amplified because some of our businesses purchase products from other of our businesses. For example, Fire and Security purchases certain products sold by
Engineered Products and Services. Therefore, a drop in demand for our fire prevention products due to lower new


residential
or office construction or other factors can cause a drop in demand for certain of our products sold by Engineered Products and Services.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.

We
are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:

•

the
generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

•

emissions
or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the
health and safety of our employees.

There
can be no assurances that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or
otherwise sanctioned by regulators.

Certain
environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties
or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims
due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.

We
have received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies, that conditions at a number of sites where we and others
disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for
natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations.
These projects relate to a variety of activities, including:

•

radioactive
materials decontamination and decommissioning;

•

solvent,
metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and

•

oil
spill equipment upgrades and replacement.

These
projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold
by us.

The
ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. Based upon our experience, current information and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial
costs (including asset retirement obligations) of approximately $284 million, of which $34 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $250 million
is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While
we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental
protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business
activities.


We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.

Pursuant to GAAP, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired.
Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization
declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. Future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges. In
addition, such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders' equity, increasing our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio. Such reduction in consolidated
net worth and increase in debt as a percentage of total capitalization could result in a default under our credit facilities.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We
are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. See Part II Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our
net revenue derived from sales in non-U.S. markets for 2005 was 50.6% of our total net revenue, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to
represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro, our
U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of
operations. Our financial statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. Dollars, our functional currency.

We
are a large buyer of steel and resin in the United States. We are also a large buyer of other commodities, including copper, brass, gold, paper, pulp and cotton. Volatility in the
prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and cash flows.

We
monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we purchase hedges or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations
from these fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are named as a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

In
the ordinary course of business, we are named as a defendant in a significant amount of litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights,
litigation alleging anti-competitive behavior and product liability litigation. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti-trust laws permit successful plaintiffs
to recover treble damages. In addition, our Healthcare business is subject to regulation and potential litigation. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur
significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


Our Healthcare business is subject to extensive regulation by the government and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

The
United States Food and Drug Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products. Failure to comply with current Good
Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead, and have led, to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls, product shortages or delays
in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to
product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales.

Our ADT business has generally experienced higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and has caused us to change the useful life of accounts, increasing our depreciation
and amortization expense.

Attrition
rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business were 14.8%, 15.1% and 15.9% on a trailing 12-month basis as of September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Although the attrition rate has been declining, if attrition rates were to trend upward, ADT's recurring revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected. Tyco amortizes the
costs of ADT's contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the ADT dealer program based on the estimated life of the customer relationships. Internally generated residential and
commercial account pools are similarly amortized. If the attrition rates were to rise Tyco may be required to accelerate the amortization of the costs which could cause a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees or agents or those of our subsidiaries.

Tyco
and its subsidiaries operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, including, but not limited to, Asia, Latin America and Europe.
Tyco's policy mandates strict compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. Nonetheless, we cannot
provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees that would violate U.S. and/or foreign laws,
including the laws governing payments to government officials. These improper actions, however, could subject the Company to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, as well
as disgorgement, against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.

From
time to time Tyco receives information alleging improper conduct of Tyco employees, agents, and/or distributors, including conduct involving potentially improper payments to foreign
government officials. Tyco's policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately, including, if warranted, taking remedial control measures and reporting its findings to relevant law
enforcement authorities.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us.

Our bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, minimum levels of net worth, and limits on incurrence of liens. We have synthetic lease facilities with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our outstanding
indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions.


Although
we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all
commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities
and our other indebtedness. Acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations. See "Liquidity
and Capital Resources—Capitalization".

Downgrades of our debt ratings would adversely affect us.

Certain downgrades by Moody's and S&P may increase our cost of capital and make it more difficult for us to obtain new financing.

Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Legislation and negative publicity regarding Bermuda companies could increase our tax burden and affect our operating results.

Legislation Relating to Government Contracts

We continue to assess the potential impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their corporate location abroad. The legislative proposals could cover the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited (a public company that
had been located in Bermuda since the 1980's with origins dating back to the United Kingdom since the early 1900's), as a result of which ADT changed its name to Tyco International Ltd. and
became the parent to the Tyco group.

In
2003, the State of California adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain Bermuda and other foreign-chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts.
To date Tyco companies have requested waivers which have been granted or are still pending, with certain requests having been denied. However, there is no reliable process for how that waiver
authority will be exercised and how the provision for such waivers will affect Tyco's business.

In
addition, the U.S. federal government and various other states and municipalities have proposed or may propose legislation that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that
move their corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict with any level of certainty the likelihood or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of
regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the impact such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.

Tyco's
revenue related to direct sales to the U.S. federal government and the State of California accounted for less than 2.0% and 0.1%, respectively, of our total net revenue for 2005
and we expect those levels to continue. We are unable to predict, however, whether the final form of the proposed legislation discussed above would also affect Tyco's indirect sales to the U.S.
federal or state governments or the willingness of Tyco's non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential
impact on us of any proposed legislation in this area and can provide no assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse.


Tax Legislation

The United States Congress has in the past considered legislation affecting the tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation
transactions. In October 2004, the United States Congress enacted such legislation, which did not, however, retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd. by ADT
Limited. Legislation passed by the U.S. Senate on November 18, 2005 would modify parts of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, but would not retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of
Tyco International Ltd. by ADT Limited. We expect various tax proposals to be introduced in the United States Congress in the future and cannot provide assurance that these proposals would not have
adverse effects on Tyco if enacted. Such adverse effects could include substantially reducing the tax benefits of our corporate structure, materially increasing our tax burden or otherwise adversely
affecting our business.

Negative Publicity

There is continuing negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, U.S. companies' use of, or relocation to, offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. As a
Bermuda company, this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of the
negative public image of Bermuda companies or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a Bermuda company.

Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

We
are organized under the laws of Bermuda. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Bermuda based on the civil liability provisions
of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our
directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that
the United States and Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the
payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in
Bermuda.

As
a Bermuda company, Tyco is governed by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and
shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of
a Bermuda company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies do not generally have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may only
exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company in limited circumstances. Under Bermuda law, a company may also agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability, not
involving fraud or dishonesty, incurred in relation to the company. Thus, holders of Tyco securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a
corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.


Item 2.    Properties

Our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world aggregating approximately 103 million square feet of floor space, of which approximately
54 million square feet are owned and approximately 49 million square feet are leased. These facilities house manufacturing, distribution and warehousing operations, as well as sales and
marketing, engineering and administrative offices.

Fire
and Security operates through a network of offices located in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and South
Africa. Our Fire and Security manufacturing facilities are located in North America, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan. The group occupies approximately
19 million square feet, of which 4 million square feet are owned and 15 million square feet are leased.

Electronics
has manufacturing facilities in North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The group occupies approximately 32 million square feet, of which
20 million square feet are owned and 12 million square feet are leased.

Healthcare
has manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The group occupies approximately 22 million square feet, of which 13 million
square feet are owned and 9 million square feet are leased.

Engineered
Products and Services has manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers throughout North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Central and
South America. The group occupies approximately 30 million square feet, of which 17 million square feet are owned and 13 million square feet are leased.

In
the opinion of management, our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing
leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. See Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our lease obligations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Securities Class Actions

As previously reported in our 2004 Form 10-K, Tyco and certain of our former directors and officers have been named as defendants in over 40
securities class actions. Most of the securities class actions have now been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. On January 28, 2003, a consolidated securities class action complaint was filed in these proceedings. On January 7, 2005,
the Company answered the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint. On January 14, 2005, lead plaintiffs made a motion for class certification, which the Company opposed on July 22, 2005. That
motion is still pending. On July 5, 2005, the Company moved for revision of the Court's October 14, 2004 order in light of a change in law, insofar as the order denied the Company's
motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to plead loss causation. On December 2, 2005, the Court denied the Company's motion.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, a class action complaint,

Ezra Charitable Trust v. Tyco International Ltd.

, was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 28, 2003. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the United States
District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Thereafter, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. On December 22, 2004, plaintiff moved to amend the complaint. The proposed amendment
asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against Tyco International Ltd. and Edward
Breen, our current Chief Executive Officer, and seeks to add as defendants David FitzPatrick, our former Chief Financial


Officer,
and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our former independent auditors. As against defendants Breen and FitzPatrick, the complaint asserts a cause of action under Section 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On March 25, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted plaintiff's motion to amend. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint
that day. On March 28, 2005, the Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the original complaint, without prejudice to the defendants' ability to move against the amended complaint. On
April 25, 2005, defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint. On September 2, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire
entered a Memorandum and Order dismissing the amended complaint. On October 18, 2005, plaintiff filed a notice to appeal in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, an action entitled

Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al.,

was filed on
June 3, 2004 in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against certain of our former directors and officers, our former auditors and Tyco. On
September 27, 2004, the Company entered into a stipulation with the plaintiffs staying the litigation during the pendency of plaintiffs' National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
arbitration to which Tyco is not a party. That action remains stayed.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted one plaintiff's motion for appointment as lead plaintiff in

Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd.,

an action originally filed on July 28, 2003 and

O'Loughlin v. Tyco
International Ltd.,

an action originally filed on September 26, 2003. On December 13, 2004, lead plaintiff Mark Newby filed a consolidated securities class
action complaint purporting to represent a class of purchasers of TyCom securities between July 26, 2000 and December 17, 2001. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco
International Ltd., TyCom, Ltd., Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated and Citigroup Inc., along with certain former Tyco and
TyCom executives. The complaint asserts causes of action under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against Tyco, TyCom, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and certain former Tyco and TyCom executives. The complaint alleges the TyCom
registration statement and prospectus relating to the sale of TyCom securities were inaccurate, misleading and failed to disclose facts necessary to make the registration statement and prospectus not
misleading. Further, the complaint alleges the defendants violated securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, executive
compensation, Tyco's and TyCom's finances and TyCom's business prospects. On February 18, 2005, the Company moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action complaint. On
September 2, 2005, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted in part and denied in part the Company's motion to dismiss. The Court granted the Company's motion
to dismiss allegations that the TyCom registration statement and prospectus were misleading to the extent that they failed to disclose alleged looting of Tyco by former senior executives, accounting
fraud, analyst conflicts and the participation by James Brennan in the offering, because plaintiffs failed to plead that those alleged omissions were disclosed during the class period, with a
resultant drop in the value of TyCom stock. However, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss with respect to other allegations.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on November 27, 2002 the State of New Jersey, on behalf of several state pension funds, filed a complaint,

District Court for the District of New Jersey against Tyco, our former auditors and certain of our former
officers and directors. On February 11, 2005, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint against Tyco, our former auditors, and certain of our former directors and officers. As against all
defendants, the amended complaint asserts causes of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, for common law
fraud, aiding and abetting common law fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Claims are asserted against the


individual
defendants under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 24(d) of the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law,
Sections 421-B:25(II) & (III) of the New Hampshire Uniform Securities Law, and for breaches of fiduciary duties. Claims are also asserted against certain of the individual

RICO statute; against Tyco, our former auditors, and certain of the individual defendants under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, and for violation of, and conspiracy to violate the New
Jersey RICO statute; and against our former auditors and certain of the individual defendants for aiding and abetting violation of the New Jersey RICO statute. Finally, claims are asserted against the
individual defendants and our former auditors for aiding and abetting the individual defendants' breaches of fiduciary duties. The Second Amended Complaint asserts that the defendants violated the
securities laws and otherwise engaged in fraudulent acts by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, the following: unauthorized and improper
compensation of certain of our former executives; their improper use of our funds for personal benefit and their improper self-dealing in real estate. On June 10, 2005, the Company
moved to dismiss in part the Second Amended Complaint, which motion remains pending before the Court.

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, on March 10, 2005, plaintiff Lionel I. Brazen filed an amended class action complaint in the Circuit Court for Cook County,
Illinois purporting to represent a class of purchasers who exchanged shares of Mallinckrodt, Inc. common stock for shares of Tyco common stock pursuant to the Joint Proxy Statement and
Prospectus, and the Registration Statement in which it was included, in connection with the October 17, 2000 merger of Tyco and Mallinckrodt, Inc. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco
International Ltd., and certain former Tyco executives and asserts causes of action under Section 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The amended class action complaint
alleges that the defendants made statements in the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and Prospectus that were materially false and misleading and failed to disclose material adverse
facts regarding the business and operations of Tyco. On April 21, 2005, the Company moved in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois to dismiss or stay or, in the alternative, to strike the
class allegations. On July 22, 2005, the Court denied the Company's motion. Also, on July 22, 2005, the Court granted the motion to dismiss individual defendants Michael A. Ashcroft,
Joshua M. Berman, Richard S. Bodman, John F. Fort, III, Stephen W. Foss, James S. Pasman Jr., W. Peter Slusser and Frank E. Walsh, Jr. On August 2, 2005, Tyco filed a motion for a finding

Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint alleges that defendants made material misrepresentations that resulted in artificially deflated stock
prices. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On July 6, 2005, plaintiff filed his
motion and brief to vacate the conditional transfer order.

On
January 31, 2003 a civil action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

Cirella v. Tyco International
et al

. Plaintiff names as defendants Tyco International Ltd., Dennis Kozlowski, Mark H. Swartz and Mark A. Belnick. Plaintiff Philip M. Cirella alleges that he
was a shareholder in CIT who received common shares of Tyco when it acquired CIT in 2000, and later purchased additional Tyco shares with Marguerite Cirella. Plaintiffs assert a cause of action
against all defendants for violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a cause of action against the individual defendants for
violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose related-party transactions, including the following: providing interest free loans,
forgiving personal loans, purchasing personal properties, using company funds to purchase personal items, selling individual Tyco shares while concealing information from investors, and failing to
disclose an ongoing criminal investigation of
Kozlowski, all of which resulted in an artificially inflated share price. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and costs against all defendants and punitive exemplary damages against the individual
defendants. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has transferred the action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.

pro se

plaintiff named as additional defendants
Tyco International (US) Inc., L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and Director and Juergen W. Gromer,

As
previously reported in our periodic filings, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation was notified that

Hall v. Kozlowski

may be
an action that should be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Thereafter, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the action to the
United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On March 16, 2005, Tyco International (US) Inc. answered plaintiff's amended complaint.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, an action was filed on June 7, 2002 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,

Levin v.
Kozlowski

, alleging that the individually named defendants breached their fiduciary duties, committed waste and mismanagement and engaged in
self-dealing in connection with Tyco's accounting practices, individual board members' use of funds, and the financial disclosures of certain mergers and acquisitions. It is further
alleged that certain of the individual defendants converted corporate assets for their own use. Plaintiffs seek money damages. Plaintiffs agreed to stay that action pending the resolution of the
federal derivative action, which was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire on October 14, 2004; and the appeal from that ruling was voluntarily
dismissed on May 19, 2005. On June 14, 2005, the plaintiffs


resumed
the

Levin

action. On September 22, 2005, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the derivative complaint.

ERISA Litigation and Investigation

As previously reported in our periodic filings, Tyco and certain of our current and former employees, officers and directors, have been named as defendants in
eight class actions brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Two of the actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire and the six remaining
actions were transferred to that court by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. All eight actions have been consolidated in the District Court in New Hampshire. The complaints purported to
bring claims on behalf of the Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans and the participants therein. On January 12, 2005, the United States District Court for
the District of New Hampshire denied, without prejudice, the Company's motion to dismiss certain additional individual defendants from the action. On January 20, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a motion
for class certification. On January 27, 2005, the Company answered the plaintiffs' consolidated complaint. Also, on January 28, 2005, the Company and certain individual defendants filed
a motion for reconsideration of the Court's January 12, 2005 order, insofar as it related to the Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement Committee. On May 25, 2005, the Court denied the
motion for reconsideration. On July 11, 2005, the Company and certain individual defendants opposed plaintiffs' motion for class certification. That motion is still pending.

In
addition, Tyco and certain of our current and former executives have received requests from the United States Department of Labor for information concerning the administration of the
Tyco International (US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans. The current focus of the Department's inquiry concerns losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in our
shares. The Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on behalf of the plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the plans for recovery of losses and additional
penalties, although it has not informed us of any intention to do so.

Tyco Litigation Against Former Senior Management

Tyco International, Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski, United States District Court, Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-7317, filed September 12, 2002, Amended April 1, 2003.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil
complaint against our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The Company amended that complaint on April 1, 2003. The amended
complaint alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from our Key Employee Loan Program and relocation program; awarded millions of dollars in unauthorized bonuses to himself and
certain other Tyco employees; engaged in improper self-dealing real estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with certain other former Tyco employees in committing these
acts. The amended complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, conversion, constructive trust, and other wrongful conduct. The amended
complaint seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's conduct, and of all remuneration, including restricted and unrestricted
shares and options, obtained by Mr. Kozlowski during the course of this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for
the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Mr. Kozlowski filed a motion to dismiss or stay the case and compel arbitration, which was denied on March 16, 2004, with one
exception relating to the arbitration of a claim asserting the fraudulent inducement of Mr. Kozlowski's retention agreement. On April 9, 2004, Mr. Kozlowski filed an Answer,
Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims, seeking amounts allegedly due pursuant to his purported retention agreement, life insurance policies, and other arrangements. Tyco filed its Reply to the
Counterclaims on April 29, 2004.


Mr. Kozlowski
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of
Mr. Kozlowski began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to it, which were similar
to certain of the claims alleged in the Company's affirmative action described above, the jury found Mr. Kozlowski guilty on all charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and securities fraud, and
all but one count of falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Kozlowski was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight and one third years to twenty five years,
and ordered to pay an individual fine of $70 million and restitution, jointly and severally with Mr. Swartz, to Tyco of $134 million within one year.

Tyco International, Ltd. v. Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 03-CV-2247
(TPG), filed April 1, 2003.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed an arbitration claim against Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and
director, on October 7, 2002. As a consequence of Mr. Swartz's refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association, we filed a civil complaint against him on
April 1, 2003, for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. The action alleges that the defendant misappropriated millions of dollars from our Key Employees Loan Program and
relocation program; approved and implemented awards of millions of dollars of unauthorized bonuses to himself and
certain other Tyco employees; awarded millions of dollars in unauthorized payments to himself; engaged in improper self dealing real estate transactions involving our assets; and conspired with
certain other former Tyco employees in committing these acts. The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, conversion, and constructive trust, and
other wrongful conduct. The action seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of the former Chief Financial Officer and director's conduct, and all remuneration, including
restricted and unrestricted shares and options, obtained by Mr. Swartz's during the course of this conduct. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United
States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Mr. Swartz moved to dismiss Tyco's complaint and to compel arbitration of the parties' respective claims. The court denied Swartz's
motion and he has appealed the court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. His appeal was heard on December 8, 2004. The First Circuit affirmed the District
Court's decision on September 7, 2005.

Mr. Swartz
was tried on criminal charges in New York County. The first criminal trial resulted in a mistrial declared on April 2, 2004. The retrial of Mr. Swartz
began on January 18, 2005 and concluded on June 17, 2005, when the jury returned verdicts. Of the thirty-one counts submitted to it, which were similar to certain of the
claims alleged in the Company's affirmative action described above, the jury found Mr. Swartz guilty on all charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and securities fraud, and all but one count of
falsification of business records. On September 19, 2005, Mr. Swartz was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight and one third years to twenty five years, and ordered to pay an
individual fine of $35 million and restitution, jointly and severally with Mr. Kozlowski, to Tyco of $134 million within one year.

Tyco International, Ltd. v. L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, United States District Court Southern District of New York,
No. 02-CV-9705, filed December 6, 2002.

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against our former
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer and Director pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 for disgorgement of short-swing profits
from prohibited transactions in our common shares believed to exceed $40 million. The action seeks disgorgement of profits, interest, attorney's fees and costs. The Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation has transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. On October 6, 2003, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz moved to
dismiss the claims against them based upon the statute of limitations. On March 16, 2004, Judge Barbadoro in the District of New Hampshire granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part with
leave for Tyco to file an amended complaint. Tyco filed an amended complaint on May 14, 2004.


The
defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the amended complaint on June 28, 2004. The defendants' motion to dismiss was denied on April 21, 2005. The defendants' motion to extend
time to answer the complaint until thirty days after the conclusion of deliberations in the criminal trial was granted on May 17, 2005. Both defendants' filed their answers on July 18,
2005.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Frank E. Walsh, Jr., United States District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 02-CV-4633,
filed June 17, 2002.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against a former director for breach of fiduciary duty and
related wrongful conduct involving a $20 million payment in connection with a 2001 acquisition by Tyco. The action alleges causes of action for restitution, breach of fiduciary duty and inducing
breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and a constructive trust, and seeks recovery for all of the losses suffered by us as a result of the defendant director's conduct. On
December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco, which was deposited by the Company in January 2003, as a result of a plea bargain agreement with the
New York County District Attorney. Our claims against Mr. Walsh are still pending. Discovery in this action had been stayed as a result of a motion by the New York County District Attorney's
Office. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. After the case was transferred to New Hampshire,
the District Court ruled that some discovery could proceed. Discovery in this and other affirmative cases has thus far consisted of the production of documents.

Tyco International Ltd. v. Mark A. Belnick,

No. 02-CV-4644 (SWK)

, filed
June 17, 2002.

As previously reported in our periodic filings, we filed a civil complaint against our former Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Counsel for
breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct. On October 21, 2002, in a related proceeding, Mr. Belnick commenced an arbitration proceeding in New York County, New York. On
October 7, 2005, the Company and Mr. Belnick entered into a settlement agreement that resolved all claims each party had previously asserted against the other.

Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the District Attorney of New York
County, the United States Department of Labor, the General Service Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our
governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. We are cooperating with these investigations and are complying with these requests.

Certain
current and former employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices for the ADT
dealer connect fees. As previously reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued.

The
United States Department of Labor served document subpoenas on Tyco and Fidelity Management Trust Company for documents concerning the administration of the Tyco International
(US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plans. The current focus of the Department's inquiry concerns the losses allegedly experienced by the plans due to investments in our stock. The
Department of Labor has authority to bring suit on behalf of the plans and their participants against those acting as fiduciaries to the plans for recovery of losses and additional penalties, although
it has not informed us of any intention to do so. The Company is continuing to cooperate with the Department's investigation.

In
November 2004, we received an order from the SEC to report facts and circumstances involving our participation, if any, in the United Nations Oil for Food Program governing
sales of Iraqi oil. On January 10, 2005, we responded to the order and will fully cooperate in any ongoing investigations.


Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

As previously disclosed in our periodic filings, we are a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions. Tyco has assessed the status of these
matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.

Mallinckrodt, Inc. ("Mallinckrodt") and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc. ("Nellcor"), plaintiffs/counter-defendants v. Masimo Corporation ("Masimo") et
al., defendants/counter-claimants,

is a consolidated patent infringement action filed on June 19, 2000 in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. Nellcor is a subsidiary of Tyco. Nellcor alleges that Masimo infringed one Nellcor patent related to pulse oximeters, which are medical devices used to measure blood oxygen levels in
patients, and Masimo alleges that Nellcor infringed four Masimo patents related to pulse oximeters. Trial in the action commenced on February 18, 2004. On March 16, 2004, the jury
returned a liability finding that Nellcor willfully infringed the four Masimo patents and that Masimo did not infringe the one Nellcor patent. On March 26, 2004, the jury awarded Masimo
$135 million in damages for Nellcor's alleged infringement through December 31, 2003. After hearing post-trial motions, the district court issued an order on July 14,
2004 which (i) denied Masimo's request to impose an injunction on the sale of pulse oximeters; (ii) reversed the jury finding of patent infringement for one of the four patents at issue;
(iii) ruled that a second patent was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent; and (iv) overturned the jury finding that the infringement was "willful." On
August 6, 2004, the district court entered final judgment that included additional damages of $30 million for Nellcor's alleged infringement from January 1, 2004 through
May 31, 2004. Nellcor asserts that Masimo infringes a second Nellcor patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,934,372—the "'372 patent"). On April 8, 2005, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Nellcor's favor that reversed the district court's summary judgment finding of no infringement regarding the '372 patent claim against Masimo. The
Court of Appeals remanded Nellcor's '372 patent claim to the district court for further proceedings. The district court has not yet scheduled trial in the '372 case.

Nellcor
appealed the jury's infringement finding on the remaining two Masimo patents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On September 7, 2005, the Court
of Appeals issued a decision on the appeal that was adverse to Nellcor. In particular, the Court of Appeals: (1) affirmed the infringement finding against Nellcor on two patents;
(2) reversed the district court's ruling of non-infringement of a third patent; and (3) reversed the district court's ruling not to enter an injunction and directed the
district court to issue an injunction. The Court of Appeals also: (1) affirmed the district court's ruling that Nellcor's infringement was not willful, which precluded
Masimo from seeking up to treble damages; and (2) affirmed the district court's ruling that one of Masimo's patents was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent.
The Company has assessed the amount of potential additional damages and interest accruing from the date of entry of final judgment to the present. Accordingly, during the fiscal quarter ending
September 30, 2005, Tyco recorded a pre-tax charge of $277 million related to this matter and does not expect to incur material losses beyond the amount accrued.

Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP ("Tyco Healthcare") and Mallinckrodt, Inc.

is a separate lawsuit filed on
May 22, 2002 also pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt are subsidiaries of Tyco. In this lawsuit, Masimo alleges
violations of antitrust laws against Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximeter products. Masimo alleges that Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt used their market position to
prevent hospitals from purchasing Masimo's pulse oximetry products. Masimo seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages. Trial in this case began on February 22, 2005.
The jury returned its verdict on March 21, 2005, and awarded Masimo $140 million in damages. The damages are automatically trebled under the antitrust statute to an award of
$420 million. Masimo's attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees and costs in addition to


the
verdict amount. The district court held a hearing on June 28, 2005 regarding post-trial motions. The parties are awaiting a decision on the post-trial motions. Tyco
has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the jury's decision will be overturned, and, further, Tyco intends to vigorously pursue all available
means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to this damage award.

Memorial Hospital v. Tyco Int'l Ltd.; Tyco Int'l (US) Inc.; Mallinckrodt Inc.; Tyco Healthcare Group LP

filed on November 22, 2005. In all nine
complaints the putative class representatives, on behalf of themselves and others, seek to recover overcharges they allege they paid for pulse oximetry products as a result of anticompetitive conduct
by Nellcor in violation of the federal antitrust laws. The Company will respond to these complaints and intends to vigorously defend the actions.

As
previously reported in the Company's periodic filings,

Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") v. United States Surgical ("U.S.
Surgical")

is a patent infringement action that was filed in April 1999 in which U.S. Surgical, a subsidiary of Tyco, is the defendant. In February 2002, the
United
States District Court for the Central District of California held that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL universal seal system, contained in certain surgical trocar and access devices manufactured by U.S.
Surgical, infringed certain of the plaintiff's patents. The district court entered a permanent injunction against U.S. Surgical based upon infringement of one of the three patents involved in the
suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's permanent injunction ruling in September 2003 for the VERSASEAL product, which is no longer on the
market. In October 2003, the district court ruled in U.S. Surgical's favor, holding that two other patents involved in the case were invalid. A trial on damages for the earlier infringement
ruling in the district court concluded on July 27, 2004. The jury awarded Applied Medical $44 million in damages and returned a finding that the earlier infringement was willful, giving
the district court discretion to enhance those damages to up to treble the damages awarded to Applied Medical by the jury. On October 1, 2004, the district court issued post-trial
rulings that (i) denied U.S. Surgical's motion to set aside the jury's finding on willfulness; and (ii) granted Applied Medical's motion for enhanced damages, enhancing the jury's
damages award by 25%, or $11 million. On January 27, 2005, the district court awarded Applied Medical $10 million in costs, prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. Thus, Applied
Medical's total award is $65 million. U.S. Surgical has appealed the damages award and the willfulness finding to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefing for the appeal has
concluded and oral argument has not yet been scheduled. Tyco has recorded a liability related to this matter and does not expect to incur material losses beyond what has already been accrued.

On
July 31, 2003, Applied Medical filed another patent infringement suit against U.S. Surgical in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint alleges that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL Plus trocar product infringes Applied Medical's U.S. Patent No. 5,385,533. Applied Medical seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. Applied Medical filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the district court denied on December 23, 2003. On
February 7, 2005, the district court granted


U.S.
Surgical's motion for summary judgment. Applied Medical is appealing the summary judgment ruling. Briefing on Applied Medical's appeal has concluded and oral argument has not yet been scheduled.

Environmental Litigation

We
have been in discussions with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection regarding historic environmental compliance issues at
a facility sold by Tyco in 2000. At this time, although these governmental authorities have not commenced any formal legal proceedings, we believe such proceedings are contemplated by these
governmental authorities, and that such proceedings may result in potential monetary sanctions of
$100,000 or more. However, we do not believe that any such monetary sanctions will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
June 2005, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources issued a Notice of Violation to Tyco Safety Products, a subsidiary within the Tyco Fire and Security business segment,
concerning self-reported air permit compliance recordkeeping deficiencies. Based on discussions with the Department, we anticipate enforcement proceedings are contemplated, and such
proceeding may result in potential monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. However, we do not believe that any sanction will have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

Commercial Litigation

Sensormatic v. Winner and Bagnara, Inc.

is a franchise dispute for which Sensormatic originally filed a complaint in 1999 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking declaratory relief. On June 28, 2004, the district court entered a stipulated judgment fixing the amount of the
defendant's past damages and commissions for royalties allegedly owed under the franchise agreement in the amount of $28 million, plus $5 million in pre-judgment interest,
and the entry of an injunction requiring Sensormatic to tender the franchise to the defendant. The judgment stayed the imposition and payment of these damages and injunctive relief until resolution of
an appeal of the district court's underlying rulings on liability to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On June 29, 2004, Sensormatic filed its Notice of Appeal to the
court of appeals. On August 31, 2005, the appellate court affirmed the district court judgment. A request for re-hearing before the entire Third Circuit was denied. No further
appeals have been taken and the judgment was satisfied on October 20, 2005. The Company does not expect to incur material losses beyond what has already been accrued and paid.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk
Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information."

Introduction

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its
subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States ("GAAP").

The
Company operates in the following business segments:

•

Fire
and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems;

•

Electronics
designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components;

•

Healthcare
designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and

•

Engineered
Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular
goods, and provides environmental and other industrial consulting services.

Unless
otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2005, 2004 and 2003 are to Tyco's fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Overview

Our business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco businesses. We achieve this goal primarily through new
product innovation, increased market share, and continued geographic expansion. We have implemented and will continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments to
achieve best-in-class operating practices.

The
Company has engaged in a series of restructuring programs since November 2003 through which we have made our operations more efficient, including exiting certain
non-core businesses or business lines and streamlining general operations. The impact of these restructuring programs on the Company's operations is discussed in "Operating Results" and
"Segment Results." Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company committed to a plan to sell its Plastics and Adhesives segment. As such, the operations of our Plastics and Adhesives segment
are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Details related to the Company's divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are
discussed in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations." We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not
align with our long term vision.

In
2005, we continued to utilize cash to fund internal growth, strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. During 2005, we utilized $3.0 billion to repurchase
our convertible debentures prior to their scheduled maturities. In total, these repurchases reduced our diluted share count by approximately 88.9 million shares on an annualized basis with the
added benefit of reducing our debt and interest expense. In addition, we utilized $2.0 billion in cash for scheduled repayments of debentures. Also, in July 2005, Tyco's Board of
Directors approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase


program.
As of September 30, 2005, we have repurchased 10.5 million of our common shares for $300 million. In the two weeks following the end of the fourth quarter of 2005, we
have repurchased an additional 7.9 million of our common shares for $216 million. As a result of this program, we anticipate spending a total of approximately $2 billion through
the second quarter of 2006 for these repurchases.

During
the first quarter of 2005, we announced a substantial increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.0125 per share to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments for 2005
increased to $628 million from $100 million in the comparable prior year period.

References
to Tyco are to the Company's continuing operations. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations and to comparatively reflect
changes in the Company's segment reporting. The operating results of the TGN are presented within Corporate and Other through the date of its disposal in the third quarter of 2005. Information for
2003 has been reclassified to reflect the transfer of Tyco's Precision Interconnect business from Healthcare to Electronics in 2004.

income for 2003 was unfavorably impacted by net charges totaling $1,625 million. These charges consisted of: (i) charges for the impairment of
long-lived assets of $815 million; (ii) charges recorded for changes in estimates of $298 million which arose from the Company's intensified internal audits and
detailed controls and operating reviews (includes net restructuring credits of $72 million, of which credits of $13 million are included in costs of sales, charges for the impairment of
long-lived assets of $10 million, charges of $240 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges of $120 million included in cost of
sales); (iii) charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million; (iv) other charges of $154 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales related
primarily to product warranty reserves and the dismantlement of customers' ADT security systems, and $120 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses related primarily
to uncollectible accounts receivable, internal investigation fees, as well as severance and facility closures, slightly offset by a credit for changes in estimates of charges recorded in prior
periods; (v) a charge of $91 million for a retroactive, incremental premium on prior period directors and officers insurance included in selling, general and administrative expenses; and
(vi) net restructuring credits of $11 million, of which charges of $2 million are included in cost of sales. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by
$191 million.

Net revenue for Fire and Security remained relatively level during 2005 as compared to 2004 as the decrease in product revenue was offset by an
increase in service revenue. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates ($274 million) and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volume of breathing and intrusion products at Tyco Safety Products as well as growth in our European fire
services business. These increases were offset by the impact of divestitures ($315 million) and decreased sales at our security business in Europe.

Operating
income increased $317 million in 2005 over the prior year. Results for the current period included net restructuring related charges of $9 million as compared to
net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $264 million in 2004. Operating income for 2005 was also favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates ($26 million) as
well as cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. These cost reductions were partially offset by increased investment in sales and marketing. In
addition, 2005 was unfavorably impacted by $18 million of divestiture-related charges.

Attrition
rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business decreased to an average of 14.8% on a trailing twelve-month basis for 2005, as compared to 15.1% for
2004 and 15.9% in 2003.

Net
revenue for Fire and Security increased 5.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 9.2% increase in product revenue and a 2.8% increase in service revenue. The increase in net
revenue was primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates ($526 million) slightly offset by the effects of divestitures ($82 million). To a lesser extent, the increase in net
revenue was due to stronger sales to retailers within worldwide security and higher sales volume of breathing systems and video and access control product at Tyco Safety Products. This increase was
partially offset by weakness in the worldwide fire service business and Continental Europe Security.

Operating
income and margin increased significantly in 2004 as compared in 2003 due partially to total charges of $512 million which were recorded during 2003, discussed below.
Additionally, the increase in operating income and margin was due to improvements within worldwide security related primarily to the combined impact of a stronger retailer market environment and cost
reductions. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were improvements within Continental Europe Security as a result of cost saving initiatives and a changing business model and Tyco
Safety Products due primarily to increased volumes. The cost savings partly reflect the benefits of the restructuring activities described below. Operating income for 2004 also includes charges
totaling $264 million, consisting primarily of restructuring ($175 million, of which $4 million is included in cost of sales), impairment ($34 million) and
divestiture ($55 million) charges, substantially all of which are associated with the comprehensive cost reduction measures that began during 2003.

Operating
income and margin in 2003 included charges totaling $512 million. Included within the $512 million are charges of $266 million (includes charges of
$128 million primarily related to


adjustments
to liabilities such as workers' compensation, professional fees, and environmental exposure, a charge of $98 million primarily due to adjusting allowances for doubtful accounts and
slow and non-moving inventory, as well as a write-off of subscriber systems, charges of $34 million for other adjustments primarily related to deferred commissions, and
charges of $6 million related to reconciling items) recorded in connection with the Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews performed during the year.
Also included within the $512 million are impairment charges of $143 million primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the ADT dealer program mostly as a
result of increased attrition rates, and to the impairment of property, plant and equipment of subscriber systems and other fixed assets; net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of
which charges of $4 million are included in cost of sales and $3 million is for the write-off of non-current assets, related to streamlining the business; and
other charges of $93 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales and $59 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to
uncollectible receivables, product warranty and the dismantlement of customers' ADT security systems. Included within the $143 million impairment charge and the $10 million net
restructuring charge is a charge of $10 million and a credit of $2 million, respectively, also related to changes in estimates recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2003.

Net revenue for Electronics increased $374 million or 3.2% in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 5.9% increase in product revenue. The
increase in net revenue was driven primarily by sales to the automotive, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, power utilities, communications equipment manufacturing, and communication service
markets. In addition, revenue increased substantially due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($294 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of the
divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business ($353 million).

Operating
income and operating margin for 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives and favorable changes in foreign currency
exchange rates ($57 million). These increases were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased commodity costs. Additionally, operating income for 2005 included net restructuring
and other credits of $5 million, as compared to net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $22 million in 2004, discussed below.

Net
revenue for Electronics increased 12.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 13.1% increase in product revenue and a 2.3% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue
was primarily a result of growth in existing businesses, specifically, the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, communications and industrial and commercial markets. This growth was partially
offset by a decrease in sales of Power Systems products in North America and in our Electrical Contracting Services, which was divested in September 2004. Additionally, favorable changes in
foreign currency rates ($560 million) contributed to the increase in net revenue.


The
40.9% increase in operating income and the 3.0 percentage point increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above, cost savings
initiatives that were executed in 2003, the positive impact of foreign currency ($90 million) and fewer charges recorded in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases in operating income were
partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased metal prices for copper and gold. Operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges totaling
$22 million. These net charges include a $52 million charge related to the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business, partially offset by $33 million of net
restructuring credits related to changes in estimates of severance, facility exit costs, distributor and supplier cancellation fees recorded in prior periods and the impact of the sale of assets that
were impaired in prior years for amounts greater than originally anticipated. These net charges also include a $3 million charge related to the impairment of property, plant, and equipment.

Operating
income and margin for 2003 include net charges totaling $236 million. The $236 million consists primarily of charges for the impairment of goodwill of
$278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group, restructuring credits of $72 million, of which $20 million is included in cost of
sales, related primarily to changes in estimates of severance and facility exit costs recorded in prior years and charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $1 million. The
net restructuring credit of $72 million includes $55 million of credits, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Company's intensified internal audits and
detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Also included within the $236 million are charges of $14 million related to adjusting asset reserves, $6 million
related to the adjustments to accrual balances, and $9 million of reconciliation and other accounting adjustments, which were also recorded in connection with the Company's intensified internal
audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003.

Net revenue for Healthcare increased $433 million or 4.8% in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from growth in
existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($141 million). Growth in Healthcare's underlying businesses was principally driven by
increased revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies which was largely the result of increased sales volume in the International division, primarily in Europe, due to a salesforce investment and sales
growth in vessel sealing, laparoscopy, and stapling. Increased sales at the Surgical division within Medical Devices & Supplies also strongly contributed, due to enhanced contracting with group
purchasing organizations, increased acceptance of Laparoscopic Gastric By-Pass procedures and increased adoption of LigaSure device. Pharmaceuticals also contributed to the increase in
revenue, although to a lesser extent. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in Retail primarily due to a difficult competitive environment and customer consolidations.


The decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to a $277 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, associated
with the adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a previously disclosed legal matter. (Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion.) This charge, combined with declines in the Retail division as a result of the competitive environment mentioned above as well as increased material and transportation costs, was
offset by substantial increases from other divisions, specifically the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as well as within Pharmaceutical. Increases in these
divisions were due to strong sales growth as mentioned above, combined with a favorable product mix. Also positively impacting the segment were reduced administrative expenses at the segment level, as
well as favorable foreign exchange rates ($41 million).

In
November of 2005, the Mallinckrodt Imaging Division voluntarily recalled two medical imaging products from the market. In each instance, Healthcare was concerned with the procedures
that were being used to assure the sterility of each product. Healthcare has not received any reports of adverse events involving patient health or safety with regard to either product. Healthcare's
Mallinckrodt Imaging Division will not restart the manufacture of the products until all corrective actions have been implemented. Healthcare does not expect that the voluntary recall of these two
products in November of 2005 will have a material adverse impact on the Company.

Net
revenue for Healthcare increased 8.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses as well as favorable foreign
currency exchange rates ($292 million). Growth in Healthcare's underlying businesses was primarily a result of increased net revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies, and to a lesser
extent, at Pharmaceuticals. The increase at Medical Devices & Supplies was largely driven by higher sales volume within our International division, particularly in Europe, due to benefits
realized from the sales force investment, back order recovery, growth in Spain and Italy and the absence of an unfavorable $47 million contractual adjustment recorded in 2003. Also contributing
to the increase in Medical Devices & Supplies were higher sales within the Medical division resulting primarily from new SharpSafety product launches and gain in market share within the wound care
market.

The
12.4% increase in operating income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the favorable margin impact of the increased sales discussed above, favorable foreign currency
exchanges rates and a continued focus on maximizing operating efficiencies. Operating income was adversely impacted by a $29 million increase in legal liabilities for an ongoing patent
infringement suit, and a $59 million increase in research and development costs. Additionally, operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestitures and impairment charges of
$18 million, composed of: (i) restructuring charges of $13 million related to the closure of various facilities offset by a credit of $2 million due to costs being less
than anticipated; (ii) a $4 million divestiture charge resulting from a
loss on the sale of a business and (iii) $3 million of impairment charges related to the closure of various facilities.

During
2003, Healthcare recorded net credits totaling $2 million, including restructuring credits of $8 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, and a
credit of $7 million related to an insurance reimbursement for certain legal fees associated with product liability cases. These credits were largely offset by charges of $12 million
related to asset reserves for inventory and charges of $1 million for adjustments to accrual balances related to workers' compensation, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection
with the Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying management's judgments and estimates.

Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $449 million or 7.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in net revenue
was largely driven by increased selling prices in Electrical and Metal Products due to higher costs of steel and other raw materials. In addition, Flow Control and, to a lesser extent, Tyco
Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($167 million) also contributed to
the increase in revenue. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new
projects, which will result in fewer but more profitable projects.

The
increases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to increased volume and demand within the industrial and commercial markets, along
with the impact of operational excellence initiatives, cost reductions from prior period restructuring programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($21 million). These
increases more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, 2005 operating income includes $1 million of a divestiture credit and $5 million of restructuring
charges as compared to the $62 million of net restructuring impairment and divestiture charges in 2004 discussed below.

Net
revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $1,509 million or 33.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003, of which $739 million, or 16.4%, represents a change in how
we classify certain sub-contract and other costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re-billed to their customers. These costs were historically treated as "pass
through" and were therefore not included in reported revenue and cost of revenue and Infrastructure Services. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the company began reflecting these
sub-contracts costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. The Company has not adjusted revenue or cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2003 as
such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no material impact on previously reported operating income, net income or cash flow.

The
remaining increase in 2004 net revenue resulted primarily from increased demand and higher selling prices at Tyco Electrical & Metal Products and at Tyco Fire &
Building Products and favorable foreign currency exchanges rates in all businesses ($298 million). Further contributing to the increase, although to a much lesser extent, were improved business
conditions at Infrastructure Services due primarily to an improved construction market and continued market share growth. Sales remained flat at Flow Control as the impact of lower levels of
non-residential construction and industrial capital spending, primarily in North America, were offset by improved activity in other end markets and geographic regions.

The
71.3% increase in operating income and the 2.3 percentage point increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were due primarily to increased net revenue discussed above, the impact
of cost reduction programs initiated in prior periods and the positive impact of foreign currency ($31 million).


These
favorable increases were partly offset by the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, operating income includes net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of
$62 million in 2004 compared to $56 million (discussed below) in 2003. Included in the $62 million charge is $53 million of restructuring and $4 million of
impairment charges related to the consolidation of manufacturing, distribution and office locations and activities at Flow Control and Infrastructure Services. The remaining $5 million
divestiture charge primarily relates to an impairment of goodwill related to the sale of a business. The revenue reclassification at Infrastructure Services discussed above had no impact on operating
income for 2004; however, this adjustment lowered 2004 operating margin by 1.5 percentage points.

During
2003, we recorded charges totaling $56 million, which includes charges of $32 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Company's
intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews, and as a result of applying management's judgments and estimates (including $19 million related to adjustments to workers'
compensation and $13 million associated with asset reserves). These charges also include charges of $8 million, of which a $6 million charge is included in cost of sales, for 2003
restructuring plans partially offset by changes in estimates due to actual costs being less than originally anticipated, charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of
$2 million relating to manufacturing and distribution consolidation at Flow Control and cost reduction projects, and other costs of $14 million included within selling, general and
administrative expenses primarily related to the reorganization and consolidation of a manufacturing facility and certain business offices.

Corporate and Other

Corporate net revenue was $29 million, $25 million and $14 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which related to the TGN business.
Corporate expense was $231 million, $397 million and $1,172 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, we recorded a $303 million gain on the sale of the
TGN business and TGN operating losses of $54 million. In addition, corporate expenses for 2005 included a $50 million charge representing the best estimate of the amount in fines and
penalties that the Company will likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a $70 million charge for estimated legacy
contingencies related to former executives' employment.

Corporate
expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $8 million and net
restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Expense also included $73 million of operating losses
related to the TGN.

Corporate
expense for 2003 includes charges totaling $824 million. Included within the $824 million is a charge of $91 million for an incremental increase in
directors and officers insurance and charges of $39 million related to internal investigation fees. Also included is a charge of $20 million primarily related to severance and benefits
for corporate employees and a restructuring credit of $11 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, both of which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the
Company's intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying management's judgments and estimates. Corporate expense also includes net restructuring
credits of $10 million, other net charges of $16 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of
$679 million primarily related to the TGN business and, to a lesser extent, the closure and relocation of corporate offices and related severance and benefits.


Interest Income and Expense

Interest income was $123 million in 2005, as compared to $91 million and $107 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Interest
expense was $815 million in 2005, as compared to $956 million in 2004 and $1,147 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 is primarily
driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense
in 2004 over 2003 is primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in 2004 and the favorable impact of interest rate swap agreements executed during the year. The weighted-average rates of
interest on total debt outstanding during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 5.6%, 5.2% and 4.9%, respectively.

Other Expense, Net

On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise
corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On
September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company
in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions. The Court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing.

The
restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as "Other expense, net" in prior years and
$25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as a receivable. In the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $109 million of income, included in "Other expense, net" in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. The Defendants have filed a notice of
appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the Defendants' success upon appeal of the larceny convictions, which, if
successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable.

During
2005, other expense, net also included losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity of $1,013 million. See
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases.

During
2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of
$341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including unamortized debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its
outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the
retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

During
2003, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million and a loss relating to the write-down of various
investments of $87 million. The value of the investments were reduced when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due
to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications industry.


Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 23.5%, 27.5% and 45.2% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is
primarily the result of the release of valuation allowances, benefits realized related to the TGN divestiture, as well as the court-ordered restitution award related to certain former executives for
which there is no tax obligation and, to a lesser extent, increased profitability in operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in charges for
which no tax benefit is available such as the loss on retirement of debt, asset impairments and the estimated settlement of the SEC enforcement action. The change in the effective tax rate from 2003
to 2004 was primarily the result of increased profitability in operations primarily in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a decrease in nondeductible charges.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,867 million and $1,967 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, relates principally to the
uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income
to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 109 which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the
complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has
reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for the years 1997 to 2000. In
connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and
is contesting certain proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through
the income tax provision.

In
connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 to 2000, the Company prepared proposed amendments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in
the taxable income previously reported. The IRS is currently reviewing the proposed amendments. The Company has not recorded the impact of the proposed amendments, pending the completion of the IRS
review. The proposed amendments, if accepted, will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed
amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. The proposed amendments are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.


Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially
permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such
subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related

Discontinued Operations

In May 2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divestiture of its Plastics and Adhesives business segment, a global manufacturer of plastic film,
specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. During the third quarter of 2005, as a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E
Products business, the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long-lived assets in the Plastics and Adhesives segment. Estimated fair values of
the reporting units and long-lived assets at Plastics and Adhesives were developed based on probability-weighted expected future cash flows of these assets. As a result of this assessment,
the Company determined that the book value of certain long-lived assets in the A&E Products reporting unit of Plastics and Adhesives was greater than their estimated fair value and
consequently recorded a long-lived asset impairment of $40 million. The Company also determined that the book value of the A&E Products reporting unit was in excess of its estimated
fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $162 million. At September 30, 2005, the Plastics and Adhesives segment met the held for sale criteria
and its results of operations have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company is negotiating a sales agreement with potential buyers and expects to complete a sale
transaction in 2006. The Company has assessed the recoverability of the segment's carrying value at September 30, 2005 and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair values,
less cost to sell, until the businesses are sold. Depending on the outcome of the sale negotiations, the Company may incur additional impairment charges.

During
2005, the Company divested eight businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Plastics and Adhesives and Engineered Products and Services.
The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value of $56 million ($55 million after tax) during
2005. During 2004, the Company reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million, of which $36 million related to goodwill impairments, to write the carrying value
of such assets down to their fair value, less cost to sell.

(Gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net

During 2003, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. During 2004,
in connection with the program, the Company divested twenty-one and liquidated four non-core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security. During 2004, the
Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million (including $60 million of goodwill impairment charges) in continuing operations in connection with the
divestiture or write-down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses.


In November 2004, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale
transaction, Tyco received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $303 million
pre-tax gain which is reflected in (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in
continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met.

During
2005, the Company divested ten businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded
net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales, in connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these
businesses, as well as the write-down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses.

Acquisitions

In 2005, Surgical, a division in Tyco's Healthcare segment, acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical technology.
The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on the achievement of certain milestones.
The acquisition of Vivant strengthens Healthcare's surgical product portfolio.

During
2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million.

During
2003, the Company purchased seven businesses within Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, Fire and Security and Electronics for an aggregate cost of $44 million in
cash, net of $1 million of cash acquired.

These
acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tyco's consolidated results from the respective
acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30

th

to
August 31

st

. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial
information in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. In conjunction with this change, the Company recorded a $21 million
after-tax gain ($28 million pre-tax) cumulative effect adjustment. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on retirement plans.

During
2003, the Company adopted FIN No. 46, which requires identification of the Company's participation in Variable Interest Entities (VIE's), which are entities with a level of
invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial
interest. For entities identified as VIE's, FIN No. 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to VIE's, if any, bears a majority of the
risk to its expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns.

The
Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the
Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial


support
and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those entities, but the Company does not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating
companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN No. 46.

The
Company had three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Company's segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and
for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003, the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN No. 46 for off-balance sheet
accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and, consequently, recorded a $75 million after-tax loss ($115 million pre-tax) cumulative
effect adjustment. One of the capital leases expired in December 2004 and the other is scheduled to expire in July 2006.

Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment

Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52-53 week" year
ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks,
with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. In addition, certain of the Company's subsidiaries consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Company's fiscal period end.
These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This
change is also consistent with the Company's ongoing efforts to enhance controls and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns the Company's external reporting with the
Company's internal operational processes. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $26 million and was reported within Shareholders' Equity.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among
other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each
period.

Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems

—Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets
in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the
depreciable lives of subscriber systems, as defined below, included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in
intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third-party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives
of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization.

With
respect to Tyco's depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate
pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco
concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight-line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen-year period continues to be appropriate given the
observed actual attrition data for these pools.

Tyco
purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer
contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships).


Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of
economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the
double-declining balance method based on a ten-year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straight-line method of
amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of
amortization described above.

Attrition
rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business were 14.8%, 15.1% and 15.9% on a trailing 12-month basis for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

—Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea
cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon
contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in
long-term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made
in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated.

Product
discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis.

Loss Contingencies

—Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other
claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or
external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Income Taxes

—In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These
estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise
from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

Deferred
tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred
tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating
results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of
future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require
significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.

We
currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any
reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An
increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant


impact
on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax
provision.

Changes
in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such charges that would have a material effect
on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

In
addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to
the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the
reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to
tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill

—In performing the goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results,
business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in
applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since management's judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be
overstated or understated.

We
elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach
based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in
economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods.

Disruptions
to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a
significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting
units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.

The
Company recorded goodwill impairments of $162 million in 2005, included in (loss) income from discontinued operations, and $96 million in 2004, of which
$36 million is included in (loss) income from discontinued operations and the remaining $60 million is included in (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Goodwill impairments in 2003 totaled $278 million.

Long-Lived Assets

—Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of
long-lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates,
reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long-lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved
in determining the fair value and useful lives of long-lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may be overstated or understated.

depreciation expense of $1,447 million, $1,428 million and $1,420 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and amortization of
intangible assets ($653 million, $691 million and $722 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively).

Includes
net proceeds of $94 million, $141 million and $124 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $204 million in 2005. The significant changes in working capital included a
$714 million increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase of $424 million in accounts payable.

The
provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory decreased from $318 million during the year ended September 30, 2004 to $234 million for the current
period. This decrease was largely the result of improved accounts receivable aging due to an overall improved credit profile of the customer base, particularly in the Fire and Security Segment, and
better collections. Additionally, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from $516 million at September 30, 2004 to $422 million at September 30, 2005 primarily due
to the write-off of fully reserved receivables and improved aging of accounts receivable at Fire and Security. The change in the inventory provision also contributed to the decrease,
however to a much lesser extent.

Includes
the add back of $1,013 million related to a loss on the retirement of debt.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003 we paid out $161 million, $228 million and $499 million, respectively, in cash related to
restructuring activities. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. We anticipate a cash outflow of approximately
$50 million in 2006 related to restructuring activities in our Electronics segment.

During
2005, 2004 and 2003, Tyco paid $328 million, $254 million and $597 million of cash, respectively, to acquire 0.4 million, 0.3 million and
0.6 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.

During
2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid $47 million, $105 million and $267 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback/earn-out liabilities.
Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions which
require Tyco to make additional "earn-out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These earn-out
payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth. At September 30, 2005 holdback/earn-out liabilities on our Consolidated Balance


Sheets
were $148 million, of which $79 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $69 million are included in other liabilities.

At
September 30, 2005, the acquisition liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $70 million, of which $24 million is included in accrued and other current
liabilities and $46 million is included in other liabilities.

During
2005, the Company sold various businesses for aggregate net proceeds of $295 million of which $120 million relates to the TGN business. The purchaser of the TGN also
assumed certain liabilities.

In
2005, Surgical, a division of Tyco's Healthcare segment, acquired Vivant, a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at approximately
$66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on the achievement of certain milestones. Additionally, in November 2005, Tyco's
Healthcare segment acquired a controlling interest in Floreane Medical Implants, a manufacturer of surgical mesh products. Both of these transactions strengthen Healthcare's surgical product
portfolio.

We
continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards.
Capital spending increased to $1.3 billion in 2005 from $1.0 billion in 2004. The level of capital expenditures is not expected to exceed depreciation in 2006 and is expected to increase
slightly relative to the level of spending in 2005.

The
amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $790 million.

During
the first half of 2006, we expect cash outflows of approximately $500 million for resolution of certain previously accrued legal and legacy matters including a patent dispute in
the Healthcare segment, an SEC enforcement action and certain holdback liabilities.

Capitalization

Shareholders' equity was $32.5 billion or $16.10 per share, at September 30, 2005, compared to $30.3 billion or $15.07 per share, at
September 30, 2004. This increase was due primarily to net income of $3.0 billion and share options exercised of $351 million. These increases were partially offset by dividends
declared of $805 million, the repurchase of shares of $300 million, and an increase in the minimum pension liability of $200 million, net of income taxes.

At
September 30, 2005, total debt decreased $4.0 billion to $12.6 billion, as compared to $16.6 billion at September 30, 2004. Total debt as a
percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders' equity) was 28% at September 30, 2005 and 35% at September 30, 2004. The decrease in debt resulted principally from our
repurchase of convertible debentures as discussed below ($2.0 billion) and scheduled repayments of debentures ($1.8 billion). Our cash balance decreased to $3.2 billion at
September 30, 2005, as compared to $4.5 billion at September 30, 2004. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the convertible debt repurchases and scheduled debt repayments
referred to above. Capital expenditures, and to a lesser extent, dividend payments and acquisition of customer accounts, also contributed to the cash decrease. Furthermore, the Company used
$300 million of cash to repurchase shares in the open market in connection with the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July 2005. These
decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations.

On
December 16, 2004, Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), entered into a $1.0 billion
5-year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. This facility replaced TIGSA's $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which was
terminated prior to its scheduled expiration date of December 20, 2004. There


were
no amounts outstanding under the 364-day revolving credit facility on the date of its termination. TIGSA also holds a $1.5 billion 3-year revolving bank credit
facility expiring on December 22, 2006 and a $500 million 3-year unsecured letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. At September 30, 2005, letters
of credit in the amount of $488 million have been issued under the $500 million facility and a remaining $12 million is available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed
under any of these facilities.

In
2005, the Company repurchased $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option for cash of
$1.8 billion and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option for cash of $1.1 billion. These
repurchases resulted in a $1.0 billion loss on the retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which is reflected in other expense, net, in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.

We
plan to use available cash to continue to fund internal growth and cost reduction opportunities within our businesses. Additionally, we believe that our cash flow generation
capability will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. While debt reduction and share repurchases are our focus in the near term, we will also
consider appropriate acquisitions should the opportunity arise.

The
Company's bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and
minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. At September 30, 2005, the Company had two remaining synthetic lease facilities, of which one will expire in July of 2006,
with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company's outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and
sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants is presently considered restrictive to the Company's operations. The Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

In
2005, we made voluntary contributions to our pension plans totaling approximately $115 million.

On
December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments
were $628 million in 2005 and are expected to approximate $800 million in 2006.

At September 30, 2005, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $1.4 billion.

At
September 30, 2005, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.5 billion due December 22, 2006, and $1.0 billion due December 16, 2009, both of
which were undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Company's operating subsidiaries have overdraft and similar types of
facilities, which total $605 million, of which $599 million was undrawn and available at September 30, 2005. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2013, most
of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations.

At
September 30, 2005, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by Electronics. This
represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and
the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome
of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined.

In
June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3-year unsecured letter of credit facility. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit,
supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this
facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSA's bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSA's 6% notes due 2013
issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the bank's base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the
occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the Company to release
approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2005, letters of credit in the amount of $488 million have been issued under the
$500 million facility


and
a remaining $12 million is available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under any of these facilities.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Legal Matters

Class Actions

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and
litigation against our former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named
as defendants in some or all of these
matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of
these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur
expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not
possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

Investigation

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Subpoenas and Document
Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be
required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business
with non-governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range
of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters.

In
2005, the Company recorded a charge of $50 million, which represents the Company's best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties management believes the Company will
likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SEC's investigation. The Company is engaged in discussions with the SEC's Division of Enforcement to resolve the matters raised in the SEC's
investigation. Final resolution of these matters is subject to a number of uncertainties, including finalizing the terms of a settlement that the Enforcement Staff will agree to recommend to the
Commission, the Company's submission of an offer of settlement approved by the Tyco Board of Directors, and the Commission's approval of the settlement offer. Until such events have occurred, the
charge is subject to change.

Intellectual Property Litigation

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's intellectual property litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings—Intellectual
Property Litigation.

Environmental Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tyco's environmental matters, see Item 1. Business—Environmental Matters.


Asbestos Matters

Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Consistent with
the national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed
against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a
subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat-resistant industrial products incorporating
asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants.

Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these
claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial
court proceeding related to asbestos claims.

When
appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 30, 2005, there
were approximately 14,000 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.

During
the 2005, the Company undertook a detailed study of its pending asbestos claims and also developed an estimate of asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as
related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The impact of this study was not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company's estimate of the
liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed through 2012. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts
recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes that the final
outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes

Tyco and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax
authorities, including the United States Internal Revenue Service, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting
certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the
income tax provision, equity or goodwill, as applicable. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from
domestic manufacturing income. It is not expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to
$500 million of permanently reinvested foreign earnings in 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. This incentive would apply to the Company's U.S. owned controlled foreign companies. The
Company continues to review whether to take advantage of this provision of the AJCA.


Compliance Matters

In 2003 an allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non-U.S.
subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into this allegation to determine whether certain payments
were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the
SEC. We are cooperating with their inquiries.

On
March 29, 2005 and August 9, 2005, Tyco reported to the DOJ and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to a number of recent
allegations of improper payments. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and
practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to them, and that it would present its factual findings upon
conclusion of the baseline review.

At
this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of its disclosures of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of
potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters.

Other Matters

The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company
does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Backlog

At September 30, 2005, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $13.6 billion, compared to a backlog of $13.0 billion at September 30,
2004. We expect that approximately 75% of our backlog at September 30, 2005 will be filled during 2006. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 30 is as follows ($ in
millions):



Fire and Security

$

6,732

$

6,726

Engineered Products and Services

4,007

3,469

Electronics

2,591

2,454

Healthcare



Corporate and Other

—


$

13,602

$

13,049

(1)

includes the TGN business which was classified as held for sale at September 30, 2004 and sold during 2005.

Within Fire and Security, backlog remained flat in part due to increased bookings within Fire Protection in North America, offset by the continued
recognition of deferred revenues on leased security systems as a result of the transition to a direct-consumer sales model in 2003. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring
revenue-in-force, which represents twelve months' fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring
revenue-in-force at September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004 was $3,550 million and $3,559 million, respectively. Within Engineered Products and
Services, backlog increased at Infrastructure Services as a result of projects in Venezuela and Canada, as well as expanding sectors in Flow Control Asia and North America. Favorable changes in
foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the increase.


Within
Electronics, backlog increased primarily due to stronger orders from improving business conditions across the majority of its end markets. Backlog in Healthcare represents unfilled orders,
which, in the nature of the businesses, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales
activity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sale of Accounts Receivable

Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received ownership and
security interests in those receivables. As collections reduced accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sold new receivables. The Company retained the risk of credit loss on the
receivables and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve was retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to repay short-term and
long-term borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and were reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale proceeds were
less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an
amount that approximated the cost that would have been incurred if commercial paper had been issued backed by these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is accounted for as a loss on
the sale of receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million and
$29 million, or 3.1% and 3.5% of the weighted-average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company retained collection and administrative
responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool.

During
2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to three of its corporate
accounts receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004 and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of
$117 million related to certain of the Company's international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short-term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The
aggregate amount outstanding under international accounts receivable programs was $80 million and $99 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Variable Interest Entities

The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those
assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the
results of those entities but do not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN
No. 46.

The
Company had three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Company's segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and
for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003 the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN No. 46 for off-balance sheet
accounting. In 2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN No. 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the
equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN No. 46. Accordingly, these ventures were
consolidated onto the Company's balance sheet effective July 1, 2003, and were subsequently deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 upon the adoption of FIN No. 46R.


Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2006 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, annual results of operations or
cash flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business—Environmental Matters for a discussion of
these liabilities.

The
Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2005 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which
is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, based on its estimate of the fair value of the vessels (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations" above).

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF
No. 04-8, "

The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share

." This EITF requires that contingently
convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF No. 04-8 became
effective for Tyco on October 1, 2004 and required retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. The adoption of this EITF did not impact diluted earnings per share for any
period presented.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "

Inventory Costs

, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS
No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage)
should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for Tyco. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's
results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.


In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair
values. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, "

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 ("APB Opinion No. 25"), "

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

." Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method compensation expense is recorded for all unvested options over the related vesting period beginning in the
quarter of adoption. The Company previously applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. Upon adoption of
SFAS No. 123R, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation costs ratably over the service period, which is the earlier of the retirement eligibility date, if the grant contains
provisions such that the award becomes fully vested upon retirement, or the stated vesting period. For grants issued to retirement eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
Company will recognize compensation costs over the stated vesting period with acceleration of any unrecognized compensation costs if and when an employee elects to retire. This statement also amends
SFAS No. 95, "

Statement of Cash Flows

," to require that excess tax benefits be reflected as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash
inflows. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is estimated to result in a compensation charge for fiscal year 2006 in the range of approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share.

In
March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107 regarding the Staff's interpretation of SFAS No. 123R. This interpretation provides the
Staff's views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. The
interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. The
Company will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No. 107 in connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation
of FASB Statement No. 143

." This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing
and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 is effective no later than the end of
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN No. 47 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143-1,

"Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste
Obligations,"

which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
("WEEE Directive"). FSP No. 143-1 is effective for the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive into law by the
applicable European Union member country. Because European Union member countries have not yet, among other steps, (i) fully enacted their national laws relating to WEEE, (ii) completed
implementation of their administrative measures and programs, (iii) clarified the scope of products considered WEEE, and/or (iv) established pricing for recycling of WEEE, the Company
can not at this time reasonably estimate the effect of applying this guidance in future periods. The Company continues to monitor WEEE developments in the respective EU countries in an effort to
reflect the impact of this Directive.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our
more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material
changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2006.

We
utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross-border transactions and anticipated
non-functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when
it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long-term debt rating.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate
swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows of principal repayment and weighted-average interest rates. For interest rate and cross-currency swaps, the table presents notional amounts
at the current market price rate and weighted average interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. The amounts included in the
table below are in U.S. Dollars, unless noted ($ in millions):

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

The information required by Regulation S-K, Item 304(a) has previously been reported by the Company. There have been no disagreements with our accountants,
as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(b).

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
September 30, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, these internal controls.


Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of record that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
Company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment
with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of September 30, 2005.

Our
management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as stated in their report which is
included herein.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discussion of Management's Responsibility

We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in this report.
We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to being recognized as a leader in governance, controls, clarity and transparency of financial statements. We are committed to making
honesty, integrity and transparency the hallmarks of how we run Tyco. We believe that to succeed in today's environment requires more than just compliance with laws and regulations—it
requires a culture based upon the highest levels of integrity and ethical values. Expected behavior starts with our Board of Directors and our senior team leading by example and includes every one of
Tyco's 247,900 global employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and business partners. One of our most crucial objectives is continuing to restore public, employee and shareholder confidence in
Tyco. We believe this is being accomplished; first, by issuing financial information and related disclosures that are accurate, complete and transparent so investors are well informed; second, by
supporting a leadership culture based on an ethic of uncompromising integrity and accountability; and third, by recruiting, training and retaining high-performance individuals who have the
highest ethical standards. We take full responsibility for meeting this objective, adopting appropriate accounting standards, designing and maintaining adequate systems of internal and disclosure
controls and devoting our full commitment and the necessary resources to these items.

Dedication to Governance, Controls and Financial Reporting

Throughout 2005, we continued to make significant progress designing, maintaining and monitoring internal controls over financial reporting and disclosures and
improving our corporate governance practices, many of which are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that a strong control environment is a dynamic process.
Therefore, we intend to continue to devote the necessary resources to maintain and improve our internal controls and corporate governance.

Our
Audit Committee meets regularly and separately with management, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditors, and our internal auditors to discuss financial reports,
controls and auditing.

We,
our Board and our Audit Committee are all committed to excellence in governance, financial reporting and controls.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Tyco International Ltd.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule for the years ended September 30, 2005
and 2004, listed in the Index at Item 15a. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Notes 8 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2005, the Company changed the measurement date of its pension and post retirement plans from
September 30 to August 31.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Tyco International Ltd.

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Tyco International Ltd. and
subsidiaries (the
"Company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Tyco's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, and under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule


as
of and for the year ended September 30, 2005 of the Company and our report dated December 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedule and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company's change of its measurement date for its pension and post retirement plans from September 30 to August 31.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors

and Shareholders of Tyco International Ltd.

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and
cash flows of Tyco International Ltd. and its subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule for the year ended September 30, 2003 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

—The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco
International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Tyco") and have
been prepared in United States Dollars, and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated
Financial Statements to 2005, 2004 and 2003 are to Tyco's fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Principles of Consolidation

—Tyco is a holding company which conducts its business through its operating subsidiaries. The
Company is a global, diversified company that provides products and services in four business segments: Fire and Security, Electronics, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services (see
Note 22). The Company consolidates companies in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares. Also, the Company consolidates variable interest entities in which the
Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities' potential losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.

As
of September 30, 2005, the Plastics and Adhesives business segment met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have been included in discontinued operations
for all periods presented.

Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment

—Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from
a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in
length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. In addition, certain of the
Company's subsidiaries had consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Company's fiscal period end. These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the reported results
of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This change is also consistent with the Company's ongoing efforts to enhance controls
and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns the Company's external reporting with the Company's internal operational processes. Net income for the transition period
related to this change was $26 million and was reported within Shareholders' Equity.

Revenue Recognition

—The Company recognizes revenue principally on four types of transactions—sales of products,
sales of security systems, subscriber billings for monitoring services and contract sales.

Revenue
from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass. This is generally when the products reach the
free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Provisions
for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in determining sales in the same
period the related sales are recorded. These provisions are based on terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical
experience and trend analysis.


Sales
of security monitoring systems include multiple elements including equipment installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. Amounts assigned to each component are
based on that component's objectively determined fair value. If fair value cannot be objectively determined for a sale involving multiple elements, the Company recognizes the revenue from installation
of services, along with the associated direct incremental costs, over the contract life.

Revenue
from the sale of services is recognized as services are rendered. Subscriber billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are
rendered, and the associated deferred revenue is included in current liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

Contract
sales for the installation of fire protection systems, undersea fiber optic cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the
percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to completion. Cost to completion is
measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current
period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable.

Certain
of the Company's long-term contracts have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based on the contract terms and technology
specific issues. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion
accounting.

In
providing services under certain contracts, Infrastructure Services (a business unit within Engineered Products and Services) incurs sub-contract and other costs that are
paid by Infrastructure Services and re-billed to their customers. Prior to January 1, 2004, these costs were treated as "pass through" and were therefore not included in reported
revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. Effective January 1, 2004, retroactive to October 1, 2003, the Company began reflecting these sub-contract costs in
both revenue and cost of revenue for Infrastructure Services, resulting in incremental revenue and cost of revenue of $649 million and $739 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
Company has not adjusted revenue or cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2003 as such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no impact on previously reported
operating income, net income or cash flow.

At
September 30, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable and other long-term receivables included retainage provisions of $91 million and $86 million,
respectively, of which $31 million and $34 million are unbilled, respectively. These retainage provisions consist primarily of electronics contracts, fire protection contracts as well as
transportation, water and environmental-related contracts and become due upon contract completion and acceptance. At September 30, 2005 the retainage provision included $57 million,
which is expected to be collected during 2006. In addition, at September 30, 2005 and 2004, $28 million and $48 million, respectively, of accounts receivable were unbilled related
to long-term contracts.


Research and Development

—Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of product
sales. Customer-funded research and development are costs incurred by Tyco that are reimbursed by customers. There is no net impact on research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements
of Income for customer-funded research and development. Research and development expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income reflects company-sponsored research and development only. See
Note 23.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. See
Note 23.

Employee Share Option Plans

—Tyco measures compensation cost in connection with employee share option plans using the intrinsic
value method and accordingly does not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price at the date of grant. Had the fair
value based method been applied by Tyco, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions set forth in Note 20, the effect on net income and earnings per share for 2005, 2004
and 2003 would have been as follows ($ in millions, except per share data):

In connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),

"Share-Based
Payment,"

("SFAS No. 123R") Tyco will begin expensing stock options in 2006 based on their fair values.

Translation of Foreign Currency

—For the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries that account in a functional currency
other than U.S. Dollars and do not operate in highly inflationary environments, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
within shareholders' equity. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are translated at the rate of
exchange in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments for the assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are included in net income.


Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, the amounts of which are not material in any period presented, are included in net income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—All highly liquid investments purchased with maturity of three months or less from the time of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

On
occasion, the Company is required to post cash collateral to secure reimbursements or indemnity obligations under letters of credit and performance guarantees in respect of various
construction projects. The amount of restricted cash in collateral was $86 million (of which $44 million is included in current assets and $42 million is included in
long-term assets) and $84 million (of which $30 million is included in current assets and $54 million is included in long-term assets) at
September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses
inherent in Tyco's receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Inventories

—Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first-in, first-out) or market
value.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

—Property, plant and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1,447 million, $1,428 million and $1,420 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when
incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Buildings and related improvements

5 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of remaining term of the lease or economic useful life

Subscriber systems

10 to 14 years

Other machinery, equipment and furniture and fixtures

2 to 20 years

The Company generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally
generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. Subscriber systems represent internally generated residential systems and internally generated commercial
systems (customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program are recorded as intangible assets). For internal purposes, the Company considers internally generated commercial accounts in three
smaller groups consisting of small business, core commercial and national commercial accounts. The internally generated residential and commercial account pools are generally amortized using the
straight-line method over a ten-year period (a fourteen-year period is used for national commercial accounts and a fourteen-year period with
write-off of specific accounts upon discontinuance is used for residential and commercial accounts in certain non-U.S. locations).

Long-Lived Assets

—The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets,
including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash
flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the


underlying
business. An impairment in the carrying value of an asset is recognized whenever anticipated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
The net book value of an asset is adjusted to fair value if its expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than book value. The amount of the impairment recognized is the difference between the
carrying value of the asset and its fair value. Fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying
degrees of perceived risk.

Goodwill

—Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur. In making this assessment,
management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent
uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

The
Company has elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142 defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Our reporting units as of September 30, 2005 were as follows: Electronic Security
Services, Fire Protection Contracting and Services, Electronic Components, Wireless, Power Systems, Printed Circuit Group, Submarine Telecommunications, Medical Devices & Supplies, Retail,
Pharmaceuticals, Flow Control and Fire & Building Products, Electrical and Metal Products, and Infrastructure Services. When changes occur in the composition of one or more segments or
reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the segments or reporting units affected based on their relative fair value.

Goodwill
valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions
including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods.

Disruptions
to the business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a
significant component of a reporting unit, and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of Tyco's
reporting units prior to the
required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in the future.

Intangible Assets, Net

—Intangible assets primarily include contracts and related customer relationships, and intellectual
property. Certain contracts and related customer relationships result from purchasing residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the
ADT dealer program. Acquired contracts and related customer relationships are recorded at their contractually determined purchase price. The Company incurs costs associated with maintaining and
operating its ADT dealer program, including brand advertising and due diligence, which are expensed as incurred. In certain programs, dealers pay the Company a non-refundable amount for
each of the contracts sold to the Company. This non-refundable charge represents dealer reimbursement to the Company for costs incurred by the Company associated with maintaining and
operating the ADT dealer program. Accordingly, each acquired contract and related customer relationship was recorded at its contractually determined purchase price, net of a non-refundable
amount charged to dealers at the time the contract was accepted for purchase.


During
the first six months (twelve months in certain circumstances) after the purchase of the customer contract, any cancellation of monitoring service, including those that result from
customer payment delinquencies, results in a chargeback by the Company to the dealer for the full amount of the contract purchase price. The non-refundable charge to the dealer is retained by the
Company even in the event of customer cancellation. The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset.

Intangible
assets arising from the ADT dealer program described above are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and
pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Based upon analyses of the period and pattern of economic benefit associated with the intangibles, which
utilize information contained in attrition studies of the ADT dealer program customer base, conducted by a third party appraiser, the Company believes that the accelerated method that presently best
achieves the matching objective above is the double-declining balance method based on a ten-year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationship,
converting to the straight-line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the
continued appropriateness of the accelerated method of amortization described above.

Other
contracts and related customer relationships, as well as intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology, are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over five to forty years. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant
a
revision to the remaining useful life. In addition, intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the asset might be impaired.

Investments

—The Company invests in equity and debt securities. Long-term investments in marketable equity
securities that represent less than twenty percent ownership are marked to market at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized gains and losses are credited or charged to other comprehensive
income within shareholders' equity for available for sale securities unless an unrealized loss is deemed to be other than temporary, in which case such loss is charged to earnings. Management
determines the proper classification of investments in debt obligations with fixed maturities and equity securities for which there is a readily determinable market value at the time of purchase and
reevaluates such classifications as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Other
equity investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting, such that they are recorded at the
lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.

For
equity investments in which the Company exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies, the equity method of accounting is used. The Company's share of net income
or losses of equity investments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and was not material in any period presented.


Product Warranty

—The Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. Manufactured products are
warranted against defects in material and workmanship when properly used for their intended purpose, installed correctly, and appropriately maintained. Generally, product warranties are implicit in
the sale; however, the customer may purchase an extended warranty. Manufactured equipment is also warranted in the same manner as product warranties. However, in most instances the warranty is either
negotiated in the contract or sold as a separate component. Warranty period terms range from 90 days (e.g., consumable products) up to 20 years (e.g., power system batteries.) The
warranty liability is determined based on historical information such as past experience, product failure rates or number of units repaired, estimated cost of material and labor, and in certain
instances estimated property damage.

Environmental Costs

—Tyco is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Tyco provides for expenses
associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company discounts environmental liabilities using a risk-free rate
of return when the obligation is fixed or reliably determinable. The impact of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2005 and 2004 was to reduce the obligation by
$14 million and $20 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

—Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities
and operating loss carryforwards, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based
upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Insurable Liabilities

—The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities.
The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial
valuations based upon historical claims experience. Certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a risk-free rate of return when the obligation is reliably determinable. The impact
of the discount on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2005 and 2004 was to reduce the obligation by $31 million and $44 million, respectively. The Company maintains
captive insurance companies to manage certain of its insurable liabilities. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.

Financial Instruments

—All derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
Changes in a derivative financial instrument's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. At its inception, if the derivative financial instrument is
designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to
earnings.

Share Premium and Contributed Surplus

—In accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, when Tyco issues shares for cash at a
premium to their par value, the resulting premium is credited to a share premium account, a non-distributable reserve. When Tyco issues shares in exchange for shares of another company,
the excess of the fair value of the shares acquired over the par value of the shares issued by Tyco is credited, where applicable, to contributed surplus, which is, subject to certain conditions, a
distributable reserve.


Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses. Significant estimates in these Consolidated Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges and credits, acquisition liabilities, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable,
estimates of future cash flows associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, fair values of financial
instruments, estimated contract revenue and related costs, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and tax valuation reserves, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions
for pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in results of operations in the period that the
event or circumstances giving rise to such changes occur.

Reclassifications

—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Accounting Pronouncements

—In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF No. 04-8, "

The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per
Share

." This EITF requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market
price trigger has been met. EITF No. 04-8 became effective for Tyco on October 1, 2004 and required retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. The
adoption of this EITF did not impact diluted earnings per share for any period presented.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 151, "

Inventory Costs

, an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to
inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for Tyco. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not
expected to have a significant impact on the Company's results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair
values. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, "

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 ("APB Opinion No. 25"), "

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

." Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded for all unvested options over the related vesting period beginning in the quarter of
adoption. The Company previously applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. Upon adoption of SFAS
No. 123R, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation costs ratably over the service period, which is the earlier of the retirement eligibility date, if the grant contains provisions
such that the award becomes fully vested upon retirement, or the stated vesting period. For grants issued to retirement eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
will recognize compensation cost over the stated vesting period with acceleration of any unrecognized compensation cost if and when an employee elects to retire. This


statement
also amends SFAS No. 95, "

Statement of Cash Flows

," to require that excess tax benefits be reflected as financing cash inflows rather
than operating cash inflows. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is estimated to result in a compensation charge for fiscal year 2006 in the range of approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per
diluted share.

In
March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107 regarding the Staff's interpretation of SFAS No. 123R. This interpretation provides the
Staff's views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. The
interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. The
Company will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No. 107 in connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation
of FASB Statement No. 143

." This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing
and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN No. 47 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143-1,

"Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste
Obligations,"

which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
("WEEE Directive"). FSP No. 143-1 is effective for the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive into law by the
applicable European Union member country. Because European Union member countries have not yet, among other steps, (i) fully enacted their national laws relating to WEEE, (ii) completed
implementation of their administrative measures and programs, (iii) clarified the scope of products considered WEEE,
and/or (iv) established pricing for recycling of WEEE, the Company can not at this time reasonably estimate the effect of applying this guidance in future periods. The Company continues to
monitor WEEE developments in the respective EU countries in an effort to reflect the impact of this Directive.

write down in carrying value of inventory and $26 million, $15 million and $11 million related to employee severance and benefits, facilities exit costs and other costs,
respectively. These charges related to several restructuring actions and facility exit plans which were initiated in 2005 as well as incremental costs incurred in 2005 related to actions initiated
during 2004. Of these charges, $25 million related to actions initiated and completed in 2005 while the remaining $28 million related to actions which commenced prior to 2005. During

restructuring credit. In addition, the Company also sold assets which were previously written down to their net realizable value in prior years for amounts greater than originally estimated and
recorded related gains as restructuring credits of $20 million. The restructuring credits were mainly incurred by Electronics.

The
$25 million of charges for 2005 restructuring initiatives were largely a result of actions taken by Electronics and Fire and Security segments which incurred severance of
$11 million and $6 million, respectively. During 2005, the Company paid $17 million related to these actions and has $8 million accrued as of September 30, 2005. In
addition, the Company transferred $4 million of severance liabilities from liabilities held for sale which resulted from the sale of TGN.

4.    Discontinued Operations and Divestitures

Discontinued Operations

In May 2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divesture of its Plastics and Adhesives business segment, a global manufacturer of plastic film,
specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. During 2005, as a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business, the
Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long-lived assets in the Plastics and Adhesives segment. Estimated fair values of the reporting units and
long-lived assets in Plastics and Adhesives were developed based on probability-weighted expected future cash flows of these assets. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined
that the book value of certain long-lived assets in the A&E Products reporting unit of Plastics and Adhesives was greater than their estimated fair value and consequently recorded a
long-lived asset impairment of $40 million. The Company also determined that the book value of the A&E Products reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value which
resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $162 million. At September 30, 2005, the Plastics and Adhesives segment met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have been
included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company is negotiating a sales agreement with potential buyers and expects to complete a sale transaction in 2006. The Company has
assessed the recoverability of the segment's carrying value at September 30, 2005 and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair values, less cost to sell, until the
businesses are sold. Depending on the outcome of the sale negotiations, the Company may incur additional impairment charges.

During
2005, the Company divested eight businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Plastics and Adhesives and Engineered Products and Services.
The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value of $56 million during 2005. During 2004, the Company
reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million, of which $36 million related to goodwill impairments, to write the carrying value of such assets down to their
fair value less cost to sell.

During
2003, Tyco recorded income from discontinued operations of $20 million for a restitution payment made by Frank E. Walsh Jr., a former director.

(Gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net

During 2003, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. During 2004,
in connection with the program, the Company divested 21 and liquidated four non-core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security. During 2004, the Company
recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million (including $60 million of goodwill impairment charges) in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or
write-down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses.

In
November 2004, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale
transaction, Tyco received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $303 million
pre-tax gain which is reflected in (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in
continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met.

During
2005, the Company divested ten businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded
net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales, in connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these
businesses, as well as the write-down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses.

5.    Acquisitions

Acquisitions

In July 2005, Surgical, a division in Tyco's Healthcare segment, acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical
technology. The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on achieving certain
milestones. Cash paid, net of cash acquired, for various other acquisitions totaled $16 million.

During
2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million.

During
2003, the Company purchased seven businesses within Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, Fire and Security and Electronics for an aggregate cost of $44 million in
cash, net of $1 million of cash acquired.

These
acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tyco's consolidated results from the respective
acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


Acquisition Liabilities

At
September 30, 2005 and 2004, acquisition liabilities were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions):



Accrued and other current liabilities

$


$


Other liabilities



$


$


These acquisition liabilities were established in connection with acquisitions in 2002 and prior and relate primarily to long-term non-cancelable
lease obligations. The Company paid $29 million, $53 million and $169 million to fund acquisition liabilities during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Holdback/Earn-out Liabilities

The Company paid cash of approximately $18 million, $52 million and $98 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relating to
holdback and earn-out liabilities related to certain prior period acquisitions. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization
of the acquisition balance sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions that would require Tyco to make additional "earn-out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves
certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These earn-out payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth and are
generally treated as additional purchase price.

At
September 30, 2005 and 2004, holdback/earn-out liabilities were included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions):



Accrued and other current liabilities

$


$


Other liabilities



$

ADT Dealer Program

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Tyco paid $328 million, $254 million and $597 million of cash, respectively, to acquire 0.4 million,
0.3 million and 0.6 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program.

6.    Other Expense, Net

On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H.


Swartz,
our former Chief Financial Officer and director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other
crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme
Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions. The
Court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing.

The
restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as "Other expense, net" in prior years and
$25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as a receivable. In the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $109 million of income, included in "Other expense, net" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Defendants have filed a notice of
appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the Defendants' success upon appeal of the larceny convictions, which, if
successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable.

During
2005, other expense, net also included losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity of $1,013 million. See
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases.

During
2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of
$341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including unamortized debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its
outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the
retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

During
2003, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million and a loss relating to the write-down of various
investments of $87 million. The value of the investments were reduced when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due
to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications industry.

At September 30, 2005, the Company had $3,967 million of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S.
jurisdictions. Of these, $2,890 million have no expiration, and the remaining $1,077 million will expire in future years through 2015. In the U.S., there were approximately
$4,162 million of federal and $5,128 million of state net operating loss carryforwards at September 30, 2005, which will expire in future years through 2025.

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,867 million and $1,967 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, relates principally to the
uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future
taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be
realized. At September 30, 2005, approximately $162 million of the valuation allowance will ultimately reduce goodwill if the net operating losses are utilized.

The
Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain proposed tax
deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision.

The
calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We
recognize


potential
liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes
will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of
these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel
the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional
charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized
in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
payment is not expected within one year.

Except
for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or
for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the
investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if
amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings
or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. It is not
expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to $500 million of permanently reinvested foreign
earnings in 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. The Company continues to review whether to take advantage of this provision of the AJCA.

8.    Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30

th

to
August 31

st

. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial
information in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million
after-tax gain ($28 million pre-tax) cumulative effect adjustment. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on retirement plans.

During
2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which requires identification
of the Company's participation in Variable Interest Entities ("VIE's"), which are entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on
a stand alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. For entities identified as VIE's, FIN No. 46 sets forth a model to evaluate
potential consolidation based on an


assessment
of which party to VIE's, if any, bears a majority of the risk to its expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns.

The
Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the
Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those
entities, but the Company does not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN
No. 46.

The
Company had three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Company's segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and
for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003, the Company adopted FIN No. 46 and, accordingly, restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN
No. 46 for off-balance sheet accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and, consequently, recorded a $75 million after-tax
loss ($115 million pretax) cumulative effect adjustment. One of the capital leases expired in December 2004 and the other is scheduled to expire in July 2006.

The computation of diluted earnings per share in 2005, 2004 and 2003 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of options to purchase
approximately 72 million, 67 million and 110 million shares, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Diluted
earnings per share for 2003 also excludes approximately 94 million shares and 49 million shares related to the Company's convertible senior debentures due 2018 and
2023, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.

10.    Sale of Accounts Receivable

Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received ownership and
security interests in those receivables. As collections reduced accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sold new receivables. The


Company
retained the risk of credit loss on the receivables and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve was retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to
repay short-term and long-term borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and were reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. The sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximated the cost that would have been incurred if commercial paper had been issued backed by
these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is accounted for as a loss on the sale of receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million and $29 million, or 3.1% and 3.5% of the weighted-average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004 and
2003, respectively. The Company retained collection and administrative responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool.

During
2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to three of its corporate
accounts receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004, and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of
$117 million related to certain of the Company's international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short-term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The
aggregate amount outstanding under international accounts receivable programs was $80 million and $99 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

11.    Investments

At September 30, 2005 and 2004, Tyco had available-for-sale investments with a fair market value of $265 million and
$62 million and a cost basis of $268 million and $65 million,
respectively. These investments consist primarily of debt securities and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
September 30, 2005, there were unrealized losses of $9 million and unrealized gains of $6 million associated with these investments. At September 30, 2004, there were unrealized
losses of $2 million and unrealized gains of $5 million associated with these investments. The unrealized gains and losses have been included as a separate component of shareholders'
equity.

At
September 30, 2005 and 2004, Tyco had held-to-maturity investments with a fair value of $4 million and $19 million, respectively. These
investments are included in other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Adjustments
to previously completed acquisitions primarily related to income tax matters.

2005 Activity

During 2005, there were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations.

2004 Activity

During 2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairments of $60 million, of which $48 million related to divested businesses and $12 million
related to businesses then classified as held for sale. These impairments are included within (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

2003 Activity

In 2003, the Company reorganized its reporting structure. As part of that reorganization, the Company finalized a plan to sell the TGN, the major operating asset
of the Tyco Submarine Telecommunications business. The results of the TGN business were previously included in Electronics, but have been presented within Corporate and Other since
September 2003 through the date of disposition in 2005.

The
reorganization resulted in a change in the composition of its reporting units. As a result, goodwill was reassigned to the new reporting units using a relative fair value allocation
approach, resulting in the recognition of impairment charges of $278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group. This charge was based on a
valuation performed by management with the assistance of a third party consultant using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of each of the reporting units.
After the impairment, there was no goodwill remaining at the Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group reporting units.


Intangible
assets, net were $5,085 million and $5,311 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accumulated amortization amounted to
$3,700 million and $3,048 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following table sets forth the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the

Intangible asset amortization expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $653 million, $691 million and $722 million, respectively.
The estimated aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets currently owned by the Company is expected to be approximately $600 million for 2006, $550 million for 2007,
$500 million for 2008, $450 million for 2009, and $350 million for 2010.

See
Note 3 for information regarding the impairment of intangible assets.

13.    Related Party Transactions

The Company has amounts due related to loans and advances issued to employees in prior years under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, relocation programs
and other advances made to executives. Loans were provided to employees under the Company's Key Employee Loan Program, which is now discontinued except for outstanding loans, for the payment of taxes
upon the vesting of shares granted under our Restricted Share Ownership Plans. The loans are not collateralized and bear interest, payable annually, at a rate based on the six-month LIBOR,
calculated annually as the average of the 12 rates in effect on the first day of the month. Loans are generally repayable in ten years, except that earlier payments are required under certain
circumstances, such as when an employee is terminated. In addition, the Company made mortgage loans to certain employees under employee relocation programs. These loans are generally payable in
15 years and are collateralized by the underlying property. During 2005 and 2004, the maximum amount outstanding under these programs was $70 million and $78 million,
respectively. Loans receivable under these programs, as well as other unsecured advances outstanding, were $68 million and $70 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004. The total
outstanding loans receivable includes loans to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Company's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (until June 2002). The amount outstanding under these loans, plus
accrued interest, was $49 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004 and the rate of interest charged


on
such loans was 3.44% and 1.73% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income on the remaining interest bearing loans totaled $2 million, $1 million, and $1 million in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Certain of the above loans totaling $20 million and $21 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are non-interest bearing.
The total non-interest bearing loans include loans to Mark A. Belnick, the Company's former Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Counsel. The amount outstanding under these loans
at both September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $15 million and is expected to be repaid in 2006.

Richard
J. Meelia, the President of Tyco Healthcare, had an outstanding loan under the Key Employee Loan Program. The rate of interest charged on such loan was 2.23% for 2003. The
maximum amount outstanding under this loan during 2003 was significantly less than $1 million and such loan was repaid in full prior to September 30, 2003.

During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors and new senior management adopted a policy under which no new loans are allowed to be granted to any officers of the Company and
existing loans are not allowed to be extended or modified.

During
2005, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Brunswick Corporation, VF Corporation and Rohm and Haas Company.
Sandra S. Wijnberg, a Director, is an executive officer of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. George W. Buckley, a Director during such period, was an executive officer of Brunswick
Corporation. Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive officer of VF Corporation. Rajiv L. Gupta, a Director, is an executive officer of Rohm and Haas Company. Purchases from Marsh & McLennan
Companies, Inc. during 2005 were approximately $23 million. Purchases from other companies noted above during 2005 aggregated less than 1 percent of consolidated net revenue.

During
2004, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Brunswick Corporation and VF Corporation. Sandra S. Wijnberg, a Director, is an executive officer of Marsh & McClennan Companies, Inc.
George W. Buckley, a Director during such period, was an executive officer of Brunswick Corporation. Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive officer of VF Corporation. Purchases from
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. during 2004 were approximately $22 million. Purchases from other companies noted above during 2004 aggregated less than 1 percent of consolidated
net revenue.

During
2003, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where the Company's Directors were employed and served as officers, including
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Brunswick Corporation, VF Corporation, Verizon Communications, Inc., Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and MicroWarehouse, Inc. Sandra S.
Wijnberg, a Director, is an executive officer of Marsh & McClennan Companies, Inc. George W. Buckley, a Director during such period, was an executive officer of Brunswick Corporation.
Mackey J. McDonald, a Director, is an executive officer of VF Corporation. Bruce S. Gordon, a Director, was an officer of Verizon Communications, Inc. Brendan R. O'Neill and Jerome B. York,
both Directors, were executive officers of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and MicroWarehouse, Inc., respectively, at the time of these commercial transactions. Purchases from Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc. and Imperial Chemical Industries PLC during 2003 were approximately $18 million and $16 million,


respectively.
Purchases from other companies noted above during 2003 aggregated less than $15 million.

In
2001, Tyco authorized compensation arrangements to L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Director until August 2002. In connection
with such arrangements, Tyco purchased executive split dollar life insurance policies for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz and entered into a shared ownership agreement with each of them whereby
the Company agreed to pay premiums for these insurance policies for an 11-year period beginning in 2001. In 2001, amended policies were executed providing for additional
Company-paid premiums. The Company is a co-beneficiary of the policies, less amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz. Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz are the
beneficiaries of the cash surrender values of the policies plus the amount of any unpaid premiums. The Company's obligations under these arrangements were entered into in recognition of services
rendered by these officers and were not contingent upon continuing employment. In 2001, the Company deposited $31 million into a consolidated rabbi trust to fund premiums on the policies. The
Consolidated Financial Statements include charges of $27 million related to the initial awards for Mr. Kozlowski and $14 million for Mr. Swartz in 2001 and charges of
$5 million for Mr. Kozlowski and $2 million for Mr. Swartz in 2002
under the policy, as amended. The Consolidated Financial Statements include charges of $7 million and $6 million for Mr. Kozlowski in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the event the
investment options within the policies do not earn specified interest amounts, Tyco has guaranteed a supplemental premium payment amount to ensure a 10% annual return on the cash surrender value, and
any unpaid premiums. This liability is accreted by a charge to earnings throughout the period of the arrangements to make the specified supplemental premium payments, if any. In conjunction with
Mr. Swartz's termination of employment, a lump sum payment of $25 million, which represented the present value of the annual premium amounts at his termination date for the remainder of
the contractual period, was made to Mr. Swartz and in return Mr. Swartz waived Tyco's obligation to continue making premium payments. The Company has accrued $65 million and
$58 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in connection with these arrangements, of which $24 million is held in the rabbi
trust as of September 30, 2005. Tyco's ability to withdraw monies from the rabbi trust for purposes other than premium payments requires Mr. Kozlowski's approval. Tyco discontinued
making premium payments for Mr. Kozlowski's insurance policy as of October 1, 2002. The Company filed affirmative actions against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz, seeking
disgorgement of all benefits under these executive life insurance policies. Pending resolution of such action against Mr. Kozlowski, premium obligations since October 2002 have been
drawn down from the cash surrender value of such policy to avoid termination of such policy's death benefit.

The
Company filed civil complaints against Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to alleged abuses of our Key Employee Loan
Program and relocation program, unauthorized bonuses, unauthorized payments, self-dealing transactions and other improper conduct.

In
June 2002, the Company filed a civil complaint against Frank E. Walsh, Jr., a former director, for breach of fiduciary duty, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty and related
wrongful conduct involving a $20 million payment by Tyco, $10 million of which was paid to Mr. Walsh with the balance paid to a charity of which Mr. Walsh is trustee. The
payment was purportedly made for Mr. Walsh's assistance in arranging our acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. On December 17, 2002, Mr. Walsh pleaded guilty to a felony
violation of New York law in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (New York


County)
and settled a civil action for violation of federal securities laws brought by the SEC in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Both the felony charge and the
civil action were brought against Mr. Walsh based on such payment. The felony charge accused Mr. Walsh of intentionally concealing information concerning the payment from Tyco's
directors and shareholders while engaged in the sale of Tyco securities in the State of New York. The SEC action alleged that Mr. Walsh knew that the registration statement covering the sale of
Tyco securities as part of the CIT Group acquisition contained a material misrepresentation concerning fees payable in connection with the acquisition. Pursuant to the plea and settlement,
Mr. Walsh paid $20 million in restitution to Tyco on December 17, 2002. Our claims against Mr. Walsh are still pending.

In
2005, the Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option for $1,823 million
and $750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a
$1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which is reflected in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

On
December 16, 2004, Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), entered into a $1.0 billion
5-year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. This facility replaced TIGSA's $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility which was entered
into in December 2003 and was terminated prior to its scheduled expiration date of December 20, 2004. There were no amounts outstanding under the 364-day revolving credit
facility on the date of its termination. At September 30, 2005 there were no amounts borrowed under this facility.

In
June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3-year unsecured letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. The facility provides for the
issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of
credit issued under this facility. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the bank's base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the
occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the release of
approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. At September 30, 2005, letters of credit in the amount of $488 million have been issued under this facility and a
remaining $12 million is available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility at September 30, 2005 and 2004.

In
December 2003, TIGSA entered into a $1.5 billion 3-year revolving bank credit facility. This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin
over LIBOR payable by TIGSA can vary based on changes in its credit rating. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts borrowed under this facility.

The
Company's bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and
amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. At September 30, 2005, the Company had two
remaining synthetic lease facilities, with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company's outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on
negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to the Company's operations. The Company is currently in compliance with
all of its debt covenants.

The
fair value of debt was approximately $13.5 billion (book value of $12.6 billion) and $19.2 billion (book value of $16.6 billion) at September 30, 2005 and
2004, respectively, based on discounted cash flow analyses using current market interest rates.

The
aggregate amounts of total debt maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): $1,954 in 2006, $759 in 2007, $1,383 in 2008 $1,734 in 2009, $19 in
2010 and $6,705 thereafter.


The
weighted-average rate of interest on total debt was 5.6% and 5.2% for the year ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps.
The weighted-average rate of interest on all variable debt was 7.2% and 6.2% at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The impact of the Company's interest rate swap agreements on reported
interest expense was a reduction of $40 million, $66 million and zero for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

15.    Guarantees

Certain of the Company's business segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial
commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2006 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the
potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the
assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and
unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate
to unknown conditions. However, the
Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 17 for a discussion of these liabilities.

The
Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2005 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which
is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, based on its estimate of the fair value of the vessels (see Note 17).

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The
Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Note 1.

Settlements include spending of $63 million by Engineered Products and Services in connection with a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of
Central Sprinkler. The VRP was initiated in 2001 and relates to the recall of certain Model GB fire sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler. Identification and
investigation of problems with the sprinkler heads commenced prior to Tyco's acquisition. Affected sprinkler heads are replaced over a 5-7 year period free of charge to property
owners.

16.    Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt and derivative
financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable and derivative financial instruments approximated book value at
September 30, 2005 and 2004. See Note 14 for the fair value estimates of debt.

All
derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and changes in a derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge criteria are met. Fair value estimates are based on relevant market information, including current market rates and prices, assuming adequate market liquidity. Fair value estimates for
interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by the Company or are provided to the Company by high-quality, third-party financial institutions known to be high volume participants
in this market.

The
Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Company's objective for utilizing derivatives is to manage these
risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. For those transactions that are designated as hedges, the Company documents relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, and links derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions. For transactions designated as hedges, the Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates, the Company enters into various interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties. To ensure
both appropriate use as a hedge and hedge accounting treatment, all derivatives entered into are designated according to a hedge objective against specified forecasted interest payments specifically
underwritten debt issuances. The Company's primary hedge objectives include the conversion of fixed-rate liabilities to variable rates. The derivative financial instruments associated with
these objectives are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges.

As
part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes forward and option contracts with financial institutions acting as principal
counterparties. The objective of these hedging contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany loans, booked accounts and notes
receivable and accounts payable, and forecasted transactions. Only in very limited circumstances is hedge accounting designated. The remaining hedges are marked to market with changes in the
derivatives fair value recognized currently in earnings.


The
Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as Tyco deals with a variety of
major banks worldwide with long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments are utilized,
thereby affording optimum clarity as to the market risk. None of the Company's derivative financial instruments outstanding at year end would result in a significant loss to the Company if a
counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, the Company does not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to its derivative
financial instruments.

Interest Rate Exposures

The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Under these agreements, the Company receives fixed rates of
interest ranging from 6% to 6.75% and pays floating rates of interest based on six month LIBOR. At September 30, 2005, the Company had interest rate swaps in a net gain position of
$20 million designated as fair value hedges with expiration dates in 2011 and 2013. The mark-to-market effects of both the interest rate swap agreements and the
underlying debt obligations were recorded in interest expense and are directly offsetting to the extent the hedges are effective.

In
addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements ("cross currency swaps") to manage its exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency
exposure on loans denominated in foreign currency. Under these agreements, the Company receives a fixed rate of interest of 6.5% and pays floating rates of interest based on six month LIBOR. At
September 30, 2005, the Company had interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements in a net gain position of
$70 million designated as a fair value hedge with an expiration date in 2011. The mark-to-market effects on the interest rate and foreign currency swaps were recorded in
interest expense and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively, and were directly offsetting to the extent the hedges were effective.

Foreign Currency Exposures

The Company hedges its net investment in certain foreign operations. Included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income was
a net gain of $31 million ($24 million after tax) and a net loss of $194 million ($142 million after tax) at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The
Company uses forward agreements to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on raw material purchases. These forward agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains
and losses resulting from these hedges, the amounts of which are not material in any period presented, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive
income to earnings and recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales when the underlying transaction impacts earnings.

Tyco
uses various options, swaps, and forwards not designated as hedging instruments, to manage foreign currency exposures on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable,
intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. At September 30, 2005, the Company had recorded net liabilities of $134 million related
to these transactions. The carrying value of financial instruments at September 30, 2005 approximates fair value.


17.    Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has facility, vehicle and equipment leases that expire at various dates through the year 2050. Rental expense under these leases and leases for
equipment was $769 million, $772 million, and $813 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At September 30, 2005, the minimum lease payment obligations under
non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: $583 million in 2006, $449 million in 2007, $344 million in 2008, $248 million in 2009, $165 million in
2010 and an aggregate of $548 million in years 2011 through 2050. These payments include obligations under an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea
vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in October 2006, a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy these vessels for
approximately $280 million, or return the vessels to the lessor and, under a residual guarantee, pay any shortfall in sales proceeds to the lessor from a third party in an amount not to exceed
$235 million. As of September 30, 2005, the Company expects this obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, based on an
estimate of the fair value of the vessels performed by management with the assistance of a third-party valuation. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred expenses of $14 million,
$14 million, and $11 million, respectively, related to this expected obligation.

The
Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services. At September 30, 2005, such obligations were as follows:
$183 million in 2006, $29 million in 2007, $20 million in 2008, $9 million in 2009, $9 million in 2010, and an aggregate of $28 million in 2011 and
thereafter.

At
September 30, 2005, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by Electronics. This
represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and
the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in Tyco's Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome
of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Class Actions

As a result of actions taken by the Company's former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of the Company's former senior corporate management, former
members of our Board of Directors and the Company's current Chief Executive Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the
federal securities laws. Tyco, certain of the Company's current and former employees, some members of the Company's former senior corporate management and some former members of the Company's Board of
Directors also are named as defendants in several Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") class actions. In addition, Tyco and some members of the Company's former senior corporate
management are subject to a SEC inquiry, and some members of the Company's former senior corporate management are named as defendants in criminal cases being prosecuted by the District Attorney of New
York County. The findings and outcomes of the prosecutions and the SEC civil action may affect the course of the purported securities class actions and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco. The
Company is generally obligated to indemnify its directors and officers and its former directors and officers who are


named
as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, the Company's insurance carriers may decline coverage, or the Company's coverage may be
insufficient to cover its expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. The Company is unable at this time to estimate what its ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is
possible that the Company will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of
these matters.

Investigation

The Company and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the District Attorney of New York County, the United
States Department of Labor, the General Service Administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into the Company's governance,
management, operations, accounting and related controls. Certain current and former employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SEC's Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related
to past accounting practices regarding the ADT dealer connect fees. As previously reported in the Company's periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued. The Department of Labor is
investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans. The Company cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can the Company predict what the results of these
investigations may be. It is possible that the Company will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government
instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact the Company's business with non-governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business. It is not
possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the matters raised in the investigations by the District Attorney or
Department of Labor.

In
2005, the Company recorded a charge of $50 million, which represents the Company's best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties management believes the Company will
likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SEC's investigation. The Company is engaged in discussions with the SEC's Division of Enforcement to resolve the matters raised in the SEC's
investigation. Final resolution of these matters is subject to a number of uncertainties, including finalizing the terms of a settlement that the Enforcement Staff will agree to recommend to the
Commission, the Company's submission of an offer of settlement approved by the Tyco Board of Directors, and the Commission's approval of the settlement offer. Until such events have occurred, the
charge is subject to change.

Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation

The Company is a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. Tyco has assessed the status of
these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.

Mallinckrodt, Inc. ("Mallinckrodt") and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Inc. ("Nellcor"), plaintiffs/counter-defendants v. Masimo Corporation ("Masimo") et
al., defendants/counter-claimants,

is a consolidated patent infringement action filed on June 19, 2000 in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California. Nellcor is a subsidiary of Tyco. Nellcor alleges that Masimo infringed one Nellcor patent related to pulse oximeters, which are medical devices used to measure blood oxygen levels in


patients,
and Masimo alleges that Nellcor infringed four Masimo patents related to pulse oximeters. Trial in the action commenced on February 18, 2004. On March 16, 2004, the jury
returned a liability finding that Nellcor willfully infringed the four Masimo patents and that Masimo did not infringe the one Nellcor patent. On March 26, 2004, the jury awarded Masimo
$135 million in damages for Nellcor's alleged infringement through December 31, 2003. After hearing post-trial motions, the district court issued an order on July 14,
2004 which (i) denied Masimo's request to impose an injunction on the sale of pulse oximeters; (ii) reversed the jury finding of patent infringement for one of the four patents at issue;
(iii) ruled that a second patent was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent; and (iv) overturned the jury finding that the infringement was "willful." On
August 6, 2004, the district court entered final judgment that included additional damages of $30 million for Nellcor's alleged infringement from January 1, 2004 through
May 31, 2004. Nellcor asserts that Masimo infringes a second Nellcor patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,934,372—the "372 patent"). On April 8, 2005, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Nellcor's favor that reversed the district court's summary judgment finding of no infringement regarding the "372 patent claim against Masimo. The
Court of Appeals remanded Nellcor's "372 patent claim to the district court for further proceedings. The district court has not yet scheduled trial in the "372 case.

Nellcor
appealed the jury's infringement finding on the remaining two Masimo patents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On September 7, 2005, the Court
of Appeals issued a decision on the appeal that was adverse to Nellcor. In particular, the Court of Appeals: (1) affirmed the infringement finding against Nellcor on two patents;
(2) reversed the district court's ruling of non-infringement of a third patent; and (3) reversed the district court's ruling not to enter an injunction and directed the
district court to issue an injunction. The Court of Appeals also: (1) affirmed the district court's ruling that Nellcor's infringement was not willful, which precluded Masimo from seeking up to
treble damages; and (2) affirmed the district court's ruling that one of Masimo's patents was unenforceable due to Masimo's inequitable conduct in seeking the patent. The Company has assessed
the amount of potential additional damages and interest accruing from the date of entry of final judgment to the present. Accordingly, during the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005, Tyco
recorded a pre-tax charge of $277 million related to this matter and does not expect to incur material losses beyond that which has been accrued.

Masimo Corporation v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP ("Tyco Healthcare") and Mallinckrodt, Inc.

is a separate lawsuit filed on
May 22, 2002 also pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt are subsidiaries of Tyco. In this lawsuit, Masimo alleges
violations of antitrust laws against Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt in the markets for pulse oximeter products. Masimo alleges that Tyco Healthcare and Mallinckrodt used their market position to
prevent hospitals from purchasing Masimo's pulse oximetry products. Masimo seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages. Trial in this case began on February 22, 2005.
The jury returned its verdict on March 21, 2005, and awarded Masimo $140 million in damages. The damages are automatically trebled under the antitrust statute to an award of
$420 million. Masimo's attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees and costs in addition to the verdict amount. The district court held a hearing on June 28, 2005 regarding
post-trial motions. The parties are awaiting a decision on the post-trial motions. Tyco has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that it is more likely than not
that the jury's decision will be overturned, and, further, Tyco intends to vigorously pursue all available means to achieve such reversal. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the Consolidated
Financial Statements with respect to this damage award.

complaints the putative class representatives, on behalf of themselves and others, seek to recover overcharges they allege they paid for pulse oximetry products as a result of anticompetitive conduct
by Nellcor in violation of the federal antitrust laws. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these
matters. The Company will respond to these complaints and intends to vigorously defend the actions.

As
previously reported in the Company's periodic filings,

Applied Medical Resources Corp. ("Applied Medical") v. United States Surgical ("U.S.
Surgical")

is a patent infringement action that was filed in April 1999 in which U.S. Surgical, a subsidiary of Tyco, is the defendant. In February 2002, the United
States District Court for the Central District of California held that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL universal seal system, contained in certain surgical trocar and access devices manufactured by U.S.
Surgical, infringed certain of the plaintiff's patents. The district court entered a permanent injunction against U.S. Surgical based upon infringement of one of the three patents involved in the
suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's permanent injunction ruling in September 2003 for the VERSASEAL product, which is no longer on the
market. In October 2003, the district court ruled in U.S. Surgical's favor, holding that two other patents involved in the case were invalid. A trial on damages for the earlier infringement
ruling in the district court
concluded on July 27, 2004. The jury awarded Applied Medical $44 million in damages and returned a finding that the earlier infringement was willful, giving the district court discretion
to enhance those damages to up to treble the damages awarded to Applied Medical by the jury. On October 1, 2004, the district court issued post-trial rulings that (i) denied
U.S. Surgical's motion to set aside the jury's finding on willfulness; and (ii) granted Applied Medical's motion for enhanced damages, enhancing the jury's damages award by 25%, or
$11 million. On January 27, 2005, the district court awarded Applied Medical $10 million in costs, prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. Thus, Applied Medical's total award is
$65 million. U.S. Surgical has appealed the damages award and the willfulness finding to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Briefing for the appeal has concluded and oral argument
has not yet been scheduled. Tyco has recorded a liability related to this matter and does not expect to incur material losses beyond what has already been accrued.

On
July 31, 2003, Applied Medical filed another patent infringement suit against U.S. Surgical in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint alleges that U.S. Surgical's VERSASEAL Plus trocar product infringes Applied Medical's U.S. Patent No. 5,385,533. Applied Medical seeks injunctive relief and unspecified monetary
damages, including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. Applied Medical filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the district court denied on December 23, 2003. On
February 7, 2005, the district court granted


U.S.
Surgical's motion for summary judgment. Applied Medical is appealing the summary judgment ruling. Briefing on Applied Medical's appeal has concluded and oral argument has not yet been scheduled.

Environmental

Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site
cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of
September 30, 2005, Tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $143 million to $420 million. As of September 30,
2005, Tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $215 million, of which $33 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and
$182 million is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $215 million, the
Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Tyco
recorded asset retirement obligations (ARO) according to the provisions of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," for future decommissioning costs based
upon cost estimates associated with legal obligation to decommission two nuclear facilities. As of September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company's ARO obligations were $69 million and
$46 million, respectively. The
increase in the reserve during the year is primarily due to accretion of $7 million and revisions to our cost estimate of $16 million. The Company believes that any potential payment on
such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Asbestos

Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. Consistent with
the national trend of increased asbestos-related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed
against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a
subsidiary's property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat-resistant industrial products incorporating
asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos-containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants.

Tyco's
involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Company's experience, a large percentage of these
claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial
court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims. However, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of
September 30, 2005, there were approximately 14,000 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.


During
2005, the Company undertook a detailed study of its pending asbestos claims and also developed an estimate of asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as
related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The impact of this study was not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company's estimate of the
liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed through the year 2012. The Company believes that it has adequate
amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos-related proceedings, the Company believes that the
final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes

The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax
authorities, including the United States Internal Revenue Service, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting
certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the
income tax provision, equity or goodwill, as appropriate.

Compliance Matters

In 2003 an allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non-U.S.
subsidiary of Tyco. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into this allegation to determine whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and
records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC and are cooperating with their
inquiries.

On
March 29, 2005 and on August 9, 2005, Tyco reported to the DOJ and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to a number of
recent allegations of improper payments. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls and
practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to them and that it would present its factual findings upon
conclusion of the baseline review. Tyco has agreed to make additional progress reports and to present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review.

At
this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent
of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters.

Other Matters

The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company
does not expect the outcome of


these
proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

18.    Retirement Plans

Measurement Date—

In 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and post retirement
benefit plans from September 30

th

to August 31

st

. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows
management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. Accordingly, all amounts
presented as of and for the year ended September 30, 2005 reflect an August 31 measurement date, while prior years reflect a September 30 measurement date. The Company has
accounted for the change in measurement date as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the accounting principle change as of the beginning of 2005 was a $21 million
after tax gain ($28 million pretax). The current year effects of this change in measurement date did not have a material effect on net periodic benefit costs.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

—The Company has a number of noncontributory and contributory defined benefit retirement plans
covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic
actuarial valuations which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service
lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans
are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. The following tables exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

The
net periodic benefit cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans for 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows ($ in millions):

In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class
performance expectations as provided by its external advisors.

The
Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going-concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a superior return on assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. For U.S. pension plans, this policy targets a 60% allocation to equity securities and a 40%
allocation to debt securities. Various asset allocation strategies are in place for non-U.S. pension plans, with a weighted-average target allocation of 54% to equity securities, 40% to
debt securities and 6% to other asset classes, including real estate and cash equivalents.


Pension plans have the following weighted-average asset allocations at September 30, 2005 and 2004:

Non-U.S. Plans

The Company made significant voluntary contributions on September 30, 2004 that were held in cash and cash equivalents on that date, which
increased the cash and cash equivalent asset allocation percentage to 11% for the U.S. plans at September 30, 2004.

Although
the Company does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for its pension funds, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly
hold Tyco stock. The aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.

The
Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary
contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that at a minimum it will make the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in 2006 of $12 million
for the U.S. plans and $107 million for non-U.S. plans.

Benefit
payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows ($ in
millions):

2011–2015



The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. plans as of September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $2,429 million and
$2,175 million, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for all non-U.S. plans as of September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $2,865 million and $2,356 million,
respectively.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2,429 million and
$2,101 million,


respectively,
at September 30, 2005 and $2,167 million and $1,957 million, respectively, at September 30, 2004.

The
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$2,733 million and $1,792 million, respectively, at September 30, 2005 and $2,209 million and $1,342 million, respectively, at September 30, 2004.

The
Company also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit plans on behalf of certain employees. Pension expense related to multi-employer plans was $15 million,
$13 million and $14 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Executive Retirement Arrangements

—Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz participated in individual Executive Retirement
Arrangements maintained by Tyco (the "ERA"). Under the ERA, Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz would have fixed lifetime benefits commencing at their normal retirement age of 65. The Company's
accrued benefit obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 30, 2005 were $62 million and $32 million, respectively. The Company's accrued benefit
obligations for Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz as of September 30, 2004 were $58 million and $30 million, respectively. Retirement benefits are available at earlier ages and
alternative forms of benefits can be elected. Any such variations would be actuarially equivalent to the fixed lifetime benefit starting at age 65. Amounts owed to Messrs. Kozlowski and Swartz
under the ERA are in dispute by the Company. For further information, see Note 13.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans

—The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include
401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants'
compensation and was $180 million, $168 million and $179 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company also maintains an unfunded
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). This plan is nonqualified and restores the employer match that certain employees lose due to IRS limits on eligible compensation under the defined
contribution plans. Expense related to the SERP was $3 million in 2005 and 2004 and $4 million in 2003.

Deferred Compensation Plans

—The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer
a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts.
The measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in the Company's 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Deferred compensation expense was
$4 million, $15 million and $17 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $172 million and $156 million at
September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Rabbi Trust

—The Company has established a rabbi trust, the assets of which may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The
trust primarily holds corporate-owned life insurance policies. The rabbi trust assets, which are consolidated, are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's
insolvency. The cash surrender value of these policies, net of outstanding loans, included in other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $218 million and $210 million
at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At September 30, 2005, the rabbi trust also


held
$37 million of cash. Plan participants are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

—The Company generally does not provide postretirement benefits other than pensions for its
employees. However, certain acquired operations provide these benefits to employees who were eligible at the date of acquisition, and a small number of U.S. and Canadian operations provide
on-going eligibility for such benefits. The following tables exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

2011–2015


For measurement purposes, for 2005 and 2004, an 11.45% and 11.41% composite annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
benefits was assumed, respectively. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, the composite annual rate of increase in health care benefit costs was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by the year
2013 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects ($ in millions):

In December 2003, the US enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act
introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Certain of the Company's retiree medical programs already provided prescription drug coverage for retirees over age 65 that were at least as generous
as the benefits provided under Medicare. This Act reduces the Company's obligation in these instances. The Company included the effects of the Act in the Consolidated Financial Statements by reducing
net periodic benefit cost by $12 million for 2005, and reflecting an actuarial gain which reduced its accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately $61 million at
September 30, 2005.

19.    Shareholder's Equity

Preference Shares

—Tyco has authorized 125,000,000 preference shares, par value of $1 per share, none
of which were issued and outstanding at September 30, 2005 or 2004. Rights as to dividends, return of capital, redemption, conversion, voting and otherwise with respect to the preference shares
may be determined by Tyco's Board of Directors on or before the time of issuance. In the event of the liquidation of the Company, the holders of any preference shares then outstanding would be
entitled to payment to them of the amount for which the preference shares were subscribed and any unpaid dividends prior to any payment to the common shareholders.

Dividends

—On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the Company's
common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0125 in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.10 thereafter. Prior to that, Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.0125 per common share.

Shares Owned by Subsidiaries

—Shares owned by subsidiaries are treated as treasury shares and are recorded at cost.

Share Repurchase Program

—In July 2005, Tyco's Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase
program. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has repurchased 10.5 million of common shares for $300 million.

20.    Share Plans

During 2004, the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") effectively replaced the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term
Incentive Plan, as amended as of May 12, 1999 (the "LTIP I Plan"), the Tyco International Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan II (the "LTIP II Plan"), as well as the Tyco
International Ltd. 1994 Restricted Stock Ownership Plan for Key Employees (the "1994 Plan") for all awards effective on and after March 25, 2004. The 2004 Plan provides for the award of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long term performance awards, restricted units, restricted stock, deferred stock units, promissory stock and other stock-based
awards (collectively, "Awards").


The 2004 Plan provides for a maximum of 160 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan. In addition, any
common shares that have been approved by the Company's shareholders for issuance under the 1994 Plan and the LTIP Plans but which have not been awarded thereunder as of January 1, 2004, reduced
by the number of common shares related to Awards made under the LTIP Plans between January 1, 2004 and March 25, 2004, the date the 2004 Plan was approved by shareholders, (or which have
been awarded but will not be issued, owing to expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, return to the Company or settlement in cash in lieu of common shares on or after January 1, 2004) and which
are no longer available for any reason (including the termination of the 1994 Plan or the LTIP Plans) will also be available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. When common shares are issued pursuant to
a grant of restricted stock, restricted units, deferred stock units, promissory stock, performance units or as payment of an annual performance bonus or other stock-based award, the total number of
common shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per common share issued. At September 30, 2005, there were approximately 172 million shares
available for future grant under the 2004 Plan (including shares available under both the LTIP I and LTIP II Plans which are now assumable under the 2004 Plan).

The
1994 Plan provided for the issuance of restricted stock grants to officers and non-officer employees. In November 2004, and upon expiration of the 1994 Plan, all
20 million shares available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan were assumed by the 2004 Plan. At September 30, 2005, 21 million shares had been granted, of which
5 million were granted under the 2004 Plan and 16 million were granted under the former 1994 Plan.

The
LTIP I Plan reserved common shares for issuance to Tyco's directors, executives and managers as share options. This plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which consists exclusively of independent directors of the Company. Tyco had reserved 140 million common shares for issuance under the LTIP I
Plan. At September 30, 2005, there were approximately 28 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan but now available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

The
LTIP II Plan was a broad-based option plan for non-officer employees. Tyco had reserved 100 million common shares for issuance under the LTIP II Plan. The terms
and conditions of this plan are similar to the LTIP I Plan. At September 30, 2005, there were approximately 24 million shares originally reserved for issuance under this plan but now
available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

Restricted Shares

—Common shares are awarded subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time
of grant under the 2004 Plan; unless otherwise stated, stock vests in equal annual installments over a period of four years. However, the majority of Tyco's restricted
share grants cliff vest after three years. All restrictions on the stock will lapse upon normal retirement, death or disability of the employee.

For
grants which vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market value of the shares are expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of criteria is
deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the shares at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. Unamortized compensation
expense is recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends. Income tax benefits resulting from the vesting of
restricted shares, including a deduction for the excess, if any, of the fair market value of restricted shares at the time of


vesting
over their fair market value at the time of the grants and from the payment of dividends on unvested shares, are credited to contributed surplus.

Share Options

—Options are granted to purchase common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of
the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2004 Plan; unless otherwise stated, options become exercisable in equal annual
installments over a period of four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant. However, the majority of Tyco's stock option grants vest in equal annual installments over
three years. Options assumed as part of business combination transactions are administered under Tyco's plan but do not reduce the available shares and retain all the rights, terms and conditions of
the respective plans under which they were originally granted.

At
September 30, 2005, approximately 390 million share options had been granted, of which 230 million, 124 million and 36 million were granted under
the LTIP I, LTIP II and 2004 Plans, respectively.

Share
option activity for all Tyco plans from September 30, 2002 to September 30, 2005 is as follows:

Deferred Stock Units

—Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to
the value of Tyco common shares with distribution deferred until termination of employment. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest
through the passage of time, the fair market value of the DSUs at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The unamortized portion of deferred compensation expense is
recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote such shares and do not have the right to receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to
receive dividends in the form of additional DSUs. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Under the 2004 Plan, unless otherwise stated, DSU's vest in equal annual installments over
four years. However, the majority of Tyco's DSU grants vest in equal annual installments over three years.

The
Company has granted 2 million DSUs, all of which were outstanding at September 30, 2005.

—Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and
employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible to participate in an employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the
purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an


additional
15% of the employee's payroll deduction. All shares purchased under the plan are purchased on the open market by a designated broker.

The
Company also maintains two other employee stock purchase plans for the benefit of employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under one plan, eligible employees
are granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. As of September 30, 2005, there were approximately 2 million
options outstanding and 7 million shares available for future issuance under this plan. All shares purchased under the other plan are purchased on the open market.

The
total compensation cost for all stock-based compensation awards was $84 million, $42 million and $43 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally,
contributed surplus includes $142 and $115 million of unamortized compensation expense for 2005 and 2004, respectively.

22.    Consolidated Segment and Geographic Data

The Company's segments are strategic business units that operate in different industries and are managed separately. Certain corporate expenses were allocated to
each operating segment's operating income, based generally on net revenues.

The
Company operates in the following business segments:

•

Fire
and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems;

•

Electronics
designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components;

•

Healthcare
designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and

•

26.    Tyco International Group S.A.

TIGSA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has public debt securities outstanding (see Note 14), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
Tyco. The following tables present condensed consolidated financial information for Tyco, TIGSA and all other subsidiaries. Condensed financial information for Tyco and TIGSA on a stand-alone basis is
presented using the equity method of accounting for subsidiaries.

During
the fourth quarter of 2005, TIGSA completed a tax-free restructuring involving the issuance of multiple classes of shares and the distribution of certain investments,
intercompany loans and intercompany receivables to Tyco International Ltd. Since the transactions were entirely among wholly owned subsidiaries of Tyco there was no impact on the consolidated
statements of financial position, operations or cash flows of the Company. The transactions did, however, result in a decrease to TIGSA's investment in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables of a
combined $18.4 billion. The effect of these transactions has been reflected below as if they occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
